AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of July 23, 2018, by and among Veritex Holdings, Inc.
("Veritex"), a Texas corporation, MustMS, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Texas
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Veritex, and Green Bancorp, Inc.
("Green"), a Texas corporation.

Preamble

The respective boards of directors of Green, Merger Sub and Veritex have
approved this Agreement and determined and declared that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests
of their respective companies and their respective shareholders.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Texas Business Organizations Code (the "TBOC"), (i) Merger
Sub will merge with and into Green (the "Merger"), with Green as the surviving
corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Veritex and (ii)
immediately thereafter, Green, as the surviving corporation in the Merger,
shall merge with and into Veritex (the "Second Merger" and, together with the
Merger, the "Holdco Mergers"), with Veritex as the surviving corporation
(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation").

Immediately following the Holdco Mergers, Green Bank, N.A., a national banking
association and wholly owned subsidiary of Green ("Green Bank"), shall merge
with and into Veritex Community Bank, a Texas state-chartered bank and wholly
owned subsidiary of Veritex ("Veritex Bank"), with Veritex Bank as the
surviving bank (the "Bank Merger," and together with the Holdco Mergers, the
"Merger Transactions").

As an inducement for Veritex to enter into this Agreement, (i) each of the
directors of Green have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting
Agreement (each a "Green Director Voting Agreement") substantially in the form
of Exhibit A-1 and (ii) certain greater than 5% shareholders of Green have
simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a "Green
Shareholder Voting Agreement" and together with the Green Director Voting
Agreements, the "Green Voting Agreements") substantially in the form of
Exhibit A-2.

As an inducement for Green to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors
of Veritex have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each
a "Veritex Voting Agreement" and together with the Green Voting Agreements,
the "Voting Agreements"), substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto.

As an inducement for the Parties to enter into this Agreement, certain
individuals set forth on Exhibit C hereto have simultaneously herewith entered
into either (i) an employment agreement with Veritex (collectively, the
"Employment Agreements"), or (ii) a termination agreement with Veritex
(together with the Employment Agreements, the "Key Individuals Agreements"),
in each case to be effective upon the Closing.

It is the intention of the Parties that for federal income tax purposes the
Holdco Mergers, taken together, shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code and within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). 

The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger Transactions and also to prescribe
certain conditions precedent to the Merger Transactions.

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are
defined in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 2

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES



2.1. Conversion of Shares.

Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Veritex, Merger Sub, Green
or the shareholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the relevant
corporations shall be converted as follows:

(a) Each share of capital stock of Veritex issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after
the Effective Time.

(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of Green,
as the surviving corporation in the Merger.

(c) Each share of Green Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that is held by Green, any Green Subsidiary, Veritex or
any Veritex Subsidiary (in each case other than shares held in any Employee
Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or otherwise held in any fiduciary or
agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) (collectively,
the "Canceled Shares") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(d) Each share of Green Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive 0.79 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Veritex Common
Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

(e) All shares of Green Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section
2.1(d), shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") or book-entry share (a
"Book-Entry Share") registered in the transfer books of Green that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Green Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Green Common Stock other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with ARTICLE 3,
including the right (if any) to receive pursuant to Section 2.4, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Veritex Common Stock into which such shares of Green
Common Stock have been converted together with the amounts (if any) payable
pursuant to Section 3.1(e).

(f) At the effective time of the Second Merger, each share of (a) Veritex
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Second Merger
and (b) common stock of Green, as the surviving corporation in the Merger,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.





2.2. Anti-Dilution Provisions.

Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to
Sections 6.2(d) and (e) and Sections 6.3(d) and (e), if at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued
and outstanding shares of Green Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Green Common Stock or the
issued and outstanding shares of Veritex Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Veritex Common
Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reasons of any reclassification, stock split (including
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, reorganization,
readjustment, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, then, the Exchange Ratio shall be
equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication,
to reflect fully the effect of any such change. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 2.2, and subject to Section 6.2 and Section 6.3, no
adjustment shall be made in the event of the issuance of additional shares of
Green Common Stock or Veritex Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock
options awarded under any director, employee or affiliate stock option plans
of Green or Veritex (or their respective Subsidiaries), as applicable, or upon
the grant or sale of shares or rights to receive shares to or for the account
of any director, employee, or Affiliate of Green or Veritex (or their
respective Subsidiaries), as applicable, in each case, pursuant to any stock
option or other compensation or benefit plans of Green or Veritex, as
applicable, in effect as of the date hereof.

2.3. Treatment of Green Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Green Stock Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest, to the
extent not previously vested (and assuming satisfaction of any performance
vesting conditions at maximum levels with respect to any Green Stock Options
that do not vest under such option's terms as a result of the consummation of
the Merger), shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of Green
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase a
number of shares of Veritex Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted Stock Option")
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of
Green Common Stock subject to such Green Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
down to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted Stock Option
shall have an exercise price per share of Veritex Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Green Common Stock subject to such Green Stock Option divided by (2)
the Exchange Ratio. In the case of any Green Stock Option that is intended to
qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 421 of the Internal Revenue
Code, the adjustments described above will be made in accordance with Treas.
Reg. 1.424-1(a), and for each other Green Stock Option in accordance with
Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Except as specifically provided above,
following the Effective Time, each Adjusted Stock Option shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Green
Stock Option under the applicable Green Equity Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, other than with respect to vesting.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Green RSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest (assuming
satisfaction of any performance vesting conditions at maximum levels) and
shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(d) payable in accordance with
ARTICLE 3 (including subject to any required Tax withholding pursuant to
Section 2.3(e)), treating the shares of Green Common Stock subject to such
Green RSU Award in the same manner as all other shares of Green Common Stock
for such purposes. 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Green SAR Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment payable as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than five Business Days following the Effective Time) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Green Common Stock
underlying such Green SAR Award by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Cash Equivalent Consideration over the exercise price per share of Green
Common Stock underlying to such Green SAR Award (subject to any required Tax
withholding pursuant to Section 2.3(e)). Any Green SAR Award with an exercise
price that equals or exceeds the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall
be canceled with no consideration being paid to the holder with respect to
such Green SAR Award.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Green, the board of directors of Green
or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.3.

(e) Each of Green, Veritex, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
as applicable and without duplication, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Green Stock Option, Green RSU Award or Green SAR Award such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Internal Revenue Code,
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

2.4. Fractional Shares.

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Veritex Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Veritex
shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interests,
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a shareholder of Veritex. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Green Common Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Veritex Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment, rounded up to the nearest cent
(without interest), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Veritex Common Stock that such holder of shares of Green
Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(d) by (ii) the Average Closing Price.

ARTICLE 3

EXCHANGE OF SHARES



3.1. Exchange Procedures.

(a) Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Veritex shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to Green (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Green Common Stock (excluding the Canceled Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Holders"), for
exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) certificates or, at Veritex's
option, evidence of Veritex Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant
to Section 2.1(d) (collectively referred to as "Veritex Certificates") for
shares 

of Veritex Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii)
immediately available funds, to the extent then reasonably determinable, equal
to any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4
(collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Veritex; provided, that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
and other amounts payable to the Holders. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Veritex. To the extent the
cash in the Exchange Fund is insufficient for any reason to make prompt cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4, Veritex shall
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make
such cash payments.

(b) Transmittal Materials. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than five days following the
Effective Time, Veritex shall instruct and direct the Exchange Agent to mail,
or otherwise provide in the case of Book-Entry Shares, to each Holder (i)
notice advising such Holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii)
transmittal materials that shall specify that delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon (A) with respect to
shares evidenced by Certificates, proper delivery of the Certificates and the
transmittal materials, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, to the Exchange Agent (and such other documents
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and (B) with respect to Book-
Entry Shares, proper delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the book-entry
transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence (if any) of the transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and (iii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in exchange for
the applicable Merger Consideration.

(c) Delivery of Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with the appropriate transmittal materials, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or the receipt
of an "agent's message" for exchange and cancellation by the Exchange Agent,
in each case together with such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent for exchange and cancellation, the Holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (and Veritex shall instruct and direct the Exchange Agent to promptly
provide such Holder) (i) the Merger Consideration in non-certificated book-
entry form and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares that such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.4 in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 3 and (B) any dividends or
distributions that the Holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(e), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
Holders on the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares
or dividends or distributions that the Holder thereof has the right to reserve
pursuant to Section 3.1(e) payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

(d) Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Green Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, Holders who held shares of Green Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.1, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing shares of Green
Common Stock (other than the Canceled Shares) shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in exchange therefor, subject, however, to
Veritex's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with
a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared or made by
Green in respect of such shares of Green Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. On 

or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented
to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section 2.4 and any dividends or
distributions (if any) pursuant to Section 3.1(e) with respect to the shares
of Green Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

(e) Dividends with Respect to Veritex Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions declared with respect to Veritex Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to any Holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the whole shares of Veritex
Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with
this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), there
shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Veritex Common Stock
(if any) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all dividends and
other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares of Veritex
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of Veritex Common Stock.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which remains
undistributed to the former Holders on the first anniversary of the Closing
Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any former Holders
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 3.1(e) with respect to Veritex Common Stock)
to which they are entitled under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

(g) No Liability. None of Veritex, Green, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any
of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any cash that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) Withholding Rights. Each and any of Veritex, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from cash in lieu of fractional shares of Veritex Common Stock, cash dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.1(e) or any other cash amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts or
property (or portions thereof) as Veritex, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment or distribution under the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Regulatory Authority by Veritex, the Surviving Corporation, or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Veritex, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with 

respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and dividend or distributions pursuant to Section
3.1(e) to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) Change in Name on Certificate. If any Veritex Certificate representing
shares of Veritex Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered in exchange therefor
is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a Veritex Certificate representing
shares of Veritex Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered, or required for
any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(k) Rights of Former Green Shareholders. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered, any Book-Entry Shares have not been canceled or any amounts
of the Merger Consideration shall remain unclaimed on the date that is three
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which such Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any
Regulatory Authority), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
or his, her or its successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.

by any Green Entity, whether or not material, that occurred during any period
covered by Green.

(d) Records. The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Green
Entities are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including
any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or
not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Green
Entities or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom),
except where such non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control has not had
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Green. Green (i) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, of the Exchange Act) to ensure the reliability of the Green
Financial Statements and to ensure that information relating to the Green
Entities is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer by others within those entities as appropriate (A) to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), (B) which allow for maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the Assets of Green, (C) that provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of Green are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Green and (D) that provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Green's Assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Green's outside auditors and
the audit committee of the board of directors of Green (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect
Green's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Green's internal
controls over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Green, there is no
reason to believe that Green's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due, if required. 

(e) Auditor Independence. The independent registered public accounting firm
engaged to express its opinion with respect to the Green Financial Statements
included in the Green SEC Reports is, and has been throughout the periods
covered thereby, "independent" within the meaning of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
S-X. As of the date hereof, the external auditor for Green and the Green Bank
has not resigned or been dismissed as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Green or Green Bank on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

4.7. Books and Records.

Since January 1, 2015, the Books and Records have been and are being
maintained in the Ordinary Course in all material respects with all applicable
accounting requirements and Laws and are complete and accurate in all material
respects to reflect corporate action by Green and Green Bank.

4.8. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

No Green Entity has incurred any Liability, except for Liabilities (a)
incurred in the Ordinary Course since December 31, 2017, (b) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(c) that are accrued or reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of
Green as of March 31, 2018 included in the Green Financial Statements at and
for the period ending March 31, 2018.

4.9. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Since December 31, 2017, there has not been a Material Adverse Effect on
Green.

(b) Since December 31, 2017, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) the Green Entities have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects only in the Ordinary Course, (ii) there
has not been any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with
respect to any material Asset owned, leased or otherwise used by any Green
Entity whether or not covered by insurance, (iii) Green has not made,
declared, paid or set aside for payment any dividend or set any record date
for or declared or made any other distribution in respect of Green's capital
stock or other equity interests (except for regular quarterly cash dividends
by Green at a rate not in excess of $0.10 per share of Green Common Stock);
(iv) there has not been any change in any Green Entity's material Tax or
accounting principles, practices or methods or systems of internal accounting
controls, except as may be required to conform to changes in Tax Laws or
regulatory accounting requirements or GAAP, and (v) there has not been any
increase in the compensation payable or that could become payable by any Green
Entity to any officer or key employee thereof or any amendment of any of the
Green Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments in the Ordinary Course.

4.10. Tax Matters.

(a) All Green Entities have timely filed or caused to be filed (giving effect
to all applicable extensions) with the appropriate taxing authorities all
material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are
required to be filed, and such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all material respects. None of the Green Entities is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return (other than any
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the Ordinary Course). All material
Taxes of the Green Entities (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are
due have been fully and timely paid to the relevant Regulatory Authority.
There are no Liens for any material amount of Taxes (other than a Lien for
Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the Assets of any of the Green
Entities. No material claim has been made in the last six years in writing by
an authority in a jurisdiction where any Green Entity does not file a Tax
Return that such Green Entity may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction. 

(b) None of the Green Entities has received any written notice of assessment
or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and
there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims, audits,
examinations, investigations or other proceedings regarding any material Taxes
of any Green Entity which have not been paid, settled or withdrawn or for
which adequate reserves have not been established on the Assets of any Green
Entity. None of the Green Entities has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of any Taxes.

(c) Each Green Entity has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and the payment thereof
to appropriate Regulatory Authority.

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each Green Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent
fiscal month end, materially exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (other than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance
sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) for such Green Entity and (ii) do not
exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing
Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the Green Entities in
filing their Tax Returns.

(e) None of the Green Entities is a party to any Tax indemnity, allocation or
sharing agreement (other than any agreement solely between the Green Entities
and other than any customary Tax indemnifications contained in credit or other
commercial agreements the primary purpose of which agreements does not relate
to Taxes) and none of the Green Entities has been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the
common parent of which was Green) or has any Tax Liability of any Person under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502‑6 or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law (other than the other members of the consolidated group of
which Green is parent), or as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise.

(f) During the two-year period ending on the date hereof, none of the Green
Entities was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Green was not a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Internal
Revenue Code.

(g) No Tax authority has required any of the Green Entities to include after
the Effective Time any material adjustment in taxable income pursuant to
Section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code or any comparable provision under
state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of transactions or events occurring
prior to the Effective Time. None of the Green Entities have participated in
any "listed transactions" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4.

(h) No Green Entity owns any Veritex Common Stock.

4.11. Assets.

Each Green Entity has good and marketable title to those Assets reflected in
the most recent Green Financial Statements as being owned by such Green Entity
or acquired after the date thereof (except Assets sold or otherwise disposed
of since the date thereof in the Ordinary Course), free and clear of all
Liens, except (a) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (b) Liens for
real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (c) easements, rights of way, and
other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the use of the Assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties and (d) such imperfections or irregularities of
title or Liens as do not materially affect the use of the Assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations
at such 

properties (collectively, "Permitted Liens"). Green is the fee simple owner of
all owned real property and the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in
the most recent Green Financial Statements, free and clear of all Liens of any
nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and each such lease is valid
without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Green, the
lessor.

4.12. Intellectual Property; Privacy.

(a) Each Green Entity owns or has a valid license to use (in each case, free
and clear of any Liens other than any Permitted Liens) all of the Intellectual
Property used or held for use to carry on the business of such Green Entity as
it is currently conducted. To the extent a Green Entity engages in the sale or
licensing to a third party of any Intellectual Property in connection with its
business operations, such Green Entity is the owner of or has a license, with
the right to sublicense, such Intellectual Property as such Intellectual
Property is sold or licensed in the conduct of its business. No Green Entity
is in Default under any material Contract pursuant to which it licenses
Intellectual Property. Since January 1, 2015, no proceedings have been
instituted, or are pending or to the Knowledge of Green threatened, which
challenge the rights of any Green Entity with respect to Intellectual Property
used, sold or licensed by such Green Entity in the course of its business, nor
has any person claimed or alleged any rights to any such Intellectual Property
owned or purported to be owned by a Green Entity. To the Knowledge of Green,
the conduct of the business of each Green Entity, including any Green Entity's
use of any Intellectual Property used or held for use by such Green Entity,
does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property rights of any other Person. Since January 1, 2015, no
Green Entity has received any written notice from any Person (i) alleging that
any Green Entity has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated
the Intellectual Property rights of such Person or (ii) challenging the scope,
validity, enforceability, registrability, use or ownership of any Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by any Green Entity.

(b) To the Knowledge of Green, no Person is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned, used, or held
for use by any Green Entity in the conduct of the respective businesses of the
Green Entities as currently conducted, and no such claims have been asserted
or threatened against any Person by any Green Entity since January 1, 2015.

(c) Green takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade
secrets, including requiring all Persons having access thereto to execute
written non-disclosure agreements. To the Knowledge of Green, there has not
been any disclosure of or access to any trade secret of any Green Entity
(including any such information of any other Person disclosed in confidence to
such Green Entity) to any Person in a manner that has resulted or is likely to
result in the loss of trade secret or other rights in and to such information.

(d) (i) The computer, information technology and data processing systems,
facilities and services used by the Green Entities, including all software,
hardware, networks, communications facilities, platforms and related systems
and services (collectively, the "Systems"), are reasonably sufficient for the
conduct of the respective businesses of the Green Entities as currently
conducted and (ii) the Systems are in sufficiently good working condition to
effectively perform all computing, information technology and data processing
operations necessary for the operation of the respective businesses of the
Green Entities as currently conducted. To Green's Knowledge, no third party
has gained unauthorized access to any Systems owned or controlled by any Green
Entity since January 1, 2015. The Green Entities have taken commercially
reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable safeguards (A) to
protect the Systems from unauthorized access and free from any disabling codes
or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other software
routines that permit or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption,
impairment, disablement, or destruction of, software, data or other materials
and (B) that are designed to reasonably 

mitigate the risks of cybersecurity breaches and attacks. Each Green Entity
has implemented reasonably appropriate backup and disaster recovery policies,
procedures and systems consistent with generally accepted industry standards
and sufficient to reasonably mitigate the risk of a material disruption to the
operation of the respective businesses of the Green Entities in all material
respects.

(e) Each Green Entity has (i) complied in all material respects with (A) all
applicable Laws which govern the receipt, collection, compilation, use,
storage, processing, sharing, safeguarding, security, disposal, destruction,
disclosure or transfer of the personal information of customers or other
individuals and similar Laws governing data privacy, and (B) all of its
published privacy and data security policies and internal privacy and data
security policies and guidelines, including with respect to the collection,
storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure, destruction and use of personally
identifiable information and (ii) taken commercially reasonable measures to
ensure that all personally identifiable information in its possession or
control is protected against loss, damage, and unauthorized access, use,
modification, or other misuse. To Green's Knowledge, there has been no
material loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use, modification, or other
misuse of any such information by any Green Entity or any other Person since
January 1, 2015.

4.13. Environmental Matters.

(a) Each Green Entity, its Participation Facilities, and its Operating
Properties are, and have been since January 1, 2015, in compliance, in all
material respects, with all applicable Environmental Laws.

(b) Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Green, since
January 1, 2015, no Litigation is or has been pending or, to the Knowledge of
Green, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority or other
forum in which any Green Entity or any of its Operating Properties or
Participation Facilities (or Green in respect of such Operating Property or
Participation Facility) has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation,
may be named as a defendant (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with or Liability under any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to
the release, discharge, spillage, or disposal into the environment of any
Hazardous Material, whether or not occurring at, on, under, adjacent to, or
affecting (or potentially affecting) a site currently or formerly owned,
leased, or operated by any Green Entity or any of its Operating Properties or
Participation Facilities, nor, to the Knowledge of Green, is there any
reasonable basis for any Litigation of a type described in this sentence.
Since January 1, 2015, no Green Entity is or has been subject to any Order
imposing any Liability or obligation with respect to any Environmental Law
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Green.

4.14. Compliance with Laws and Permits.

(a) Each Green Entity has, and since January 1, 2015, has had, in effect all
Permits necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its material Assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted (and have paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith), except where the failure to have in
effect any such Permit has not had or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Green.
Since January 1, 2015, there has occurred no material Default under any such
Permit and, to the Knowledge of Green, no suspension or cancellation of any
such Permit is threatened. None of the Green Entities:

(i) is in material Default under any of the provisions of its certificate of
formation, articles of incorporation or association or bylaws (or other
governing instruments); 

(ii) is in material Default under any Laws, Orders, or Permits applicable to
its business or employees conducting its business; or

(iii) since January 1, 2015, has received any written notification or
communication from any agency or department of federal, state, or local
government or any Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof asserting that any
Green Entity is not in compliance with any Laws or Orders or engaging in an
unsafe or unsound activity.

(b) Each Green Entity is in material compliance with all applicable Laws,
regulatory capital requirements, or Orders to which they or their Assets may
be subject, including, but not limited to, the Securities Laws, the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, the Interagency Policy Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment
Products, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Fair Housing
Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the Electronic
Funds Transfer Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Truth-in-Lending
Act and Regulation Z, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 and Regulation X, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act and Regulation B, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act and Regulation W, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the National Bank Act, the
BHC Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"), the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, any Laws promulgated by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Laws
administered or enforced by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the OCC, the U.S.
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other
Regulatory Authority, and any other applicable Law related to data protection
or privacy, bank secrecy, financing or leasing practices, money laundering
prevention, fair lending and fair housing, discrimination (including, without
limitation, discriminatory lending, anti-redlining, equal credit opportunity
and fair credit reporting), truth-in-lending, real estate settlement
procedures or consumer credit, all agency requirements relating to the
origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans, and all
applicable regulations under the foregoing. Green and Green Bank are "well-
capitalized" and "well managed" (as those terms are defined in applicable
regulations).

(c) Green Bank (i) has properly certified all foreign deposit accounts and has
made all necessary tax withholdings on all of its deposit accounts, (ii) has
timely and properly filed and maintained all requisite currency transaction
reports and other related forms, including any requisite custom reports
required by any agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, including the
IRS, and (iii) has timely filed all suspicious activity reports with the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (bureau of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury) required to be filed by it pursuant to applicable Laws and
regulations referenced in this Section 4.14.

(d) Since January 1, 2015, each Green Entity has properly administered all
accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which any
Green Entity serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of
the applicable governing documents and applicable Laws, except where the
failure to so administer such accounts has not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Green. Since January 1, 2015, no Green Entity nor, to Green's Knowledge,
any director, officer, or employee of any Green Entity, has committed any
breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account,
and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and
accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account, except as has not had
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Green.



4.15. Community Reinvestment Act Performance.

Green Bank is an "insured depository institution" as defined in the FDIA and
applicable regulations thereunder, is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and has received a Community
Reinvestment Act rating of "satisfactory" or better in its most recently
completed examination, and Green has no Knowledge of the existence of any fact
or circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which could reasonably be
expected to result in Green Bank having its current rating lowered such that
it is no longer "satisfactory" or better.

4.16. Labor Relations.

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on a Green entity or Affiliate of a
Green Entity, no Green Entity is the subject of any pending or, to the
Knowledge of Green, threatened Litigation asserting that it or any other Green
Entity has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other violation of
state or federal labor Law or seeking to compel it or any other Green Entity
to bargain with any labor organization or other employee representative as to
wages or conditions of employment. No Green Entity or Affiliate of a Green
Entity is (nor, since January 1, 2015, has been) a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or subject to any bargaining order, injunction or other
Order relating to Green's relationship or dealings with its employees, any
labor organization or any other employee representative, and no Green Entity
or Affiliate of a Green Entity is currently negotiating any collective
bargaining agreement. To the Knowledge of Green, since January 1, 2015, there
has not been any attempt by any Green Entity employees or any labor
organization or other employee representative to organize or certify a
collective bargaining unit or to engage in any other union organization
activity with respect to the workforce of any Green Entity. The employment of
each employee of Green Entity are terminable at will by the relevant Green
Entity without any penalty, liability or severance obligation incurred by any
Green Entity.

(b) Section 4.16(b) of Green's Disclosure Memorandum separately sets forth all
of Green's employees, including for each such employee: name, job title, hire
date, full- or part-time status, Fair Labor Standards Act designation, work
location, current compensation paid or payable, all wage arrangements, fringe
benefits (other than employee benefits applicable to all employees, which
benefits are set forth on Section 4.17(a) of Green's Disclosure Memorandum),
bonuses, incentives, or commissions paid the past three years, and visa and
greencard application status. To Green's Knowledge, no employee of any Green
Entity is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or arrangement,
including any confidentiality or non-competition agreement, that in any way
adversely affects or restricts the performance of such employee's duties. No
key employee of any Green Entity has provided written notice to a Green Entity
of his or her intent to terminate his or her employment with the applicable
Green Entity as of the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, to Green's
Knowledge, no key employee intends to terminate his or her employment with
Green before Closing.

(c) Section 4.16(c) of Green's Disclosure Memorandum contains a complete and
accurate listing of the name (if an entity, including the name of the
individuals employed by or providing services on behalf of such entity) and
contact information of each individual who is currently provided personal
services to any Green Entity as an independent contractor, consultant,
freelancer or other service provider (collectively, "Independent
Contractors"). A copy of each Contract relating to the services provided by
any such Independent Contractor to a Green Entity has been made available to
Veritex prior to the date hereof. The 

engagement of each Independent Contractor of each Green Entity is terminable
at will by the relevant Green Entity without any penalty, liability or
severance obligation incurred by any Green Entity.

(d) The Green Entities have, or will have no later than the Closing Date, paid
all accrued salaries, bonuses, commissions, and other wages due to be paid
through the Closing Date. Each of the Green Entities is and at all times has
been in material compliance with all Law governing the employment of labor,
including but not limited to, all contractual commitments and all such Laws
relating to wages, hours, affirmative action, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, disability accommodation, employee leave,
unemployment, worker classification, immigration, safety and health, and
workers' compensation.

(e) Since January 1, 2015, there have not been any wage and hour claims,
discrimination, disability accommodation, or other employment claims or
charges by any employee of any Green Entity or by any individual who has
applied for employment with any Green Entity, nor, to Green's Knowledge, are
there any such claims or charges currently threatened by any employee or
applicant of any Green Entity. To Green's Knowledge, there are no governmental
investigations open with or under consideration by the United States
Department of Labor ("DOL"), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any
other federal or state governmental body charged with administering or
enforcing employment related Laws.

(f) All of the Green Entities' employees are employed in the United States and
are either United States citizens or are legally entitled to work in the
United States under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as
amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws related to the
employment of non-United States citizens applicable in the state in which the
employees are employed. Each individual who renders services to any Green
Entity is properly classified as having the status of an employee or
independent contractor or other non-employee status (including for purposes of
taxation and Tax reporting and under Green Benefit Plans).

4.17. Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) A complete and accurate list of each material Green Benefit Plan, as of
the date hereof, is set forth in Section 4.17(a) of Green's Disclosure
Memorandum. No Green Benefit Plan is subject to any Laws other than those of
the United States or any state, county, or municipality in the United States.
With respect to each material Green Benefit Plan, Green has made available to
Veritex a true and complete copy of the plan document (including all
amendments thereto), or if such plan is not in writing, a written description
of such Green Benefit Plan, and to the extent applicable: (i) all current
trust agreements or other funding arrangements; (ii) the most recently
received determination letter, opinion letter or advisory opinion issued by
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"); (iii) the most recently filed
annual report on IRS Form 5500; (iv) the most recent summary plan description
and summary of material modifications thereto; (v) any material correspondence
with the DOL, IRS, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") or any other
governmental entity within the last three years; and (vi) the most recent
financial statement and actuarial valuation or other valuation report. Section
4.17(a) of Green\'s Disclosure Memorandum separately lists each participant in
the Green Change in Control Severance Plan.

(b) Each Green Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in all material
respects in compliance with the terms of such Green Benefit Plan and in all
material respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code, ERISA, and any other applicable Laws. Each Green
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter, or for a
prototype plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Green Benefit Plan and on which such Green Benefit Plan is
entitled to rely. No event has 

occurred and no circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of such Green Benefit Plan.

(c) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Green, threatened claims or
disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the Green Benefit Plans
(other than routine claims for benefits), and no action, proceeding,
prosecution, inquiry or hearing has been commenced with respect to any Green
Benefit Plan.

(d) No Green Entity has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 406 of ERISA)
for which there is not an exemption with respect to any Green Benefit Plan,
and in any case, no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any
Green Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code being imposed
on any Green Entity. No Green Entity has breached its fiduciary duty with
respect to a Green Benefit Plan in connection with any acts taken (or failed
to be taken) with respect to the administration or investment of the assets of
any Green Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code
being imposed on any Green Entity. To Green's Knowledge, no other "fiduciary,"
within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA, has breached his, her or its
fiduciary duty with respect to a Green Benefit Plan or otherwise has any
liability in connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with
respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any Green Benefit
Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability or
excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code being imposed on any Green
Entity. All Green Stock Options, and any other stock options granted by a
Green Entity and outstanding at any time within the last six years, were
granted at no less than "fair market value" for purposes of Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code, and each such stock option has at all times been in
compliance with or exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(e) Neither Green nor any Green ERISA Affiliate has at any time been a party
to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been obligated to
contribute to, or had any material liability with respect to, or would
reasonably be expected to have any such obligation to contribute to or
material liability with respect to: (i) any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA); (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code); or (iii) any voluntary employees'
beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code). Neither Green nor any Green ERISA Affiliate currently
provides any health benefits that are not fully insured by a third party
insurance company.

(f) Each Green Benefit Plan or other arrangement of a Green Entity that
constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code has been written, executed and operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations
thereunder.

(g) Each Green Benefit Plan that is a group health plan is in compliance in
all material respects with applicable requirements of the Affordable Care Act,
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-1(a)(3). No Green Entity
has or could reasonably be expected to have any material liability for Taxes
under Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code. No Green Entity has any
Liability or obligation to provide health, medical or life insurance benefits
to any current or former employee, officer, or director or other service
provider (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of any Green Entity after
his or her termination of employment or service with the Green Entities,
except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits continuation Laws
and for which the covered individual pays the full cost of coverage. 

(h) No Green Benefit Plan is subject to Title VI of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Green Benefit Plan by

undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance

Internal Revenue Code. No Green Entity or, to the Knowledge of Green, any
Affiliate thereof has taken or agreed to take any action, and Green does not

other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport
to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens which have
been perfected, and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor 

named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except in all cases
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought). The notes or other credit or security documents with respect
to each such outstanding Loan were in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Laws at the time of origination or purchase by a Green Entity
and are valid and enforceable in all material respects.

employee, officer, director, principal shareholder or other affiliate Loans on
which the borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or
other relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower is paying
a rate which was not in compliance with Regulation O, and (iii) all such Loans
are and were originated in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.

(f) No Green Entity is now nor has it been since January 1, 2015 subject to
any material fine, suspension, settlement or other Contract or other
administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase
commitment from, any Regulatory Authority relating to the origination, sale or
servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

The allowance for loan and lease losses ("ALLL") reflected in the Green
Financial Statements was, as of the date of each of the Green Financial
Statements, in the reasonable opinion of management of Green, (a) in
compliance with Green's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of
the ALLL and in compliance in all material respects with the standards

certificate of formation, articles of incorporation or association, bylaws, or
other governing documents of each Veritex Subsidiary comply with applicable
Law in all material respects.

5.5. Regulatory Reports.

(a) Veritex's Reports. Since January 1, 2015, Veritex has filed on a timely
basis, all forms, filings, registrations, submissions, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with any applicable Regulatory Authority, including any and all federal and

accurate in all material respects and in compliance 

in all material respects with the requirements of any applicable Law. Veritex
is in material compliance with the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

(b) Veritex SEC Reports. An accurate and complete copy of each final

the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1,
2015 (the "Veritex SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such Veritex SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements, prospectuses and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness, dates of first sale of securities and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Veritex SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Veritex has failed in any

Reserve and the Texas Department of Banking and any other applicable
Regulatory Authorities, as the case may be, all reports, returns, filings,

banking Laws, and such reports were complete and accurate in all material
respects and in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
any applicable Law. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory

all material respects, and have been prepared from, and are in accordance with
the books and records of the Veritex Entities, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, regulatory accounting principles and the applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC, in each case, consistently applied except as may be otherwise indicated

material respects the consolidated financial condition of the Veritex Entities
as of the respective dates set forth therein and the consolidated results of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows of the Veritex Entities for
the respective periods set forth therein, subject in the case of the interim
financial statements to year-end adjustments. The consolidated financial
statements of Veritex to be prepared after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing will be true, accurate and complete in all material
respects and will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial condition of Veritex as of the respective dates set forth therein
and the 

results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows of Veritex for the
respective periods set forth therein, subject in the case of unaudited
financial statements to year-end adjustments.

(b) Call Reports. The financial statements contained in the Call Reports of
Veritex Bank for the periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017,

all material respects, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and
regulatory accounting principles consistently applied, except as may be

for the respective periods set forth therein, subject to year-end adjustments.

(c) Systems and Processes. Since January 1, 2015, neither Veritex nor Veritex
Bank nor, to Veritex's Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of any Veritex Entity has received any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the adequacy of such
systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of Veritex Financial
Statements or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies
or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of any Veritex Entity or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that any Veritex Entity has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. Since January 1, 2015, no attorney representing any Veritex Entity,
whether or not employed by a Veritex Entity, has reported evidence of a
material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Veritex or any of its officers, directors or employees to the
board of directors of Veritex or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of Veritex (in their capacity as such). To Veritex's Knowledge, there
has been no instance of fraud by any Veritex Entity, whether or not material,
that occurred during any period covered by Veritex.

(d) Records. The records, systems, controls, data and information of the
Veritex Entities are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Veritex Entities or accountants (including all means of access thereto
and therefrom), except where such non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Veritex. Veritex (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) to ensure the
reliability of the Veritex Financial Statements and to ensure that information
relating to the Veritex Entities is made known to the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer by others within those entities as appropriate (A)
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (B) which allow for maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Assets of Veritex, (C) that provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
Veritex are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of Veritex and (D) that provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of Veritex's Assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to Veritex's outside auditors and the audit committee of
the board of directors of Veritex (x) any significant 

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect
Veritex's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Veritex's
internal controls over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Veritex, there
is no reason to believe that Veritex's outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due, if required.

(e) Auditor Independence. The independent registered public accounting firm
engaged to express its opinion with respect to the Veritex Financial
Statements included in the Veritex SEC Reports is, and has been throughout the
periods covered thereby, "independent" within the meaning of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. As of the date hereof, the external auditor for Veritex and
the Veritex Bank has not resigned or been dismissed as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Veritex or Veritex Bank on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

5.9. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Since December 31, 2017, there has not been a Material Adverse Effect on

respect to any material Asset owned, leased or otherwise used by any Veritex
Entity whether or not covered by insurance, (iii) Veritex has not made,
declared, paid or set aside for payment any dividend or set any record date
for or declared or made any other distribution in respect of Veritex's capital
stock or other equity interests; (iv) there has not been any change in any
Veritex Entity's material Tax or accounting principles, practices or methods
or systems of internal accounting controls, except as may be required to
conform to changes in Tax Laws or regulatory accounting requirements or GAAP,

are due have been fully and timely paid to the relevant Regulatory Authority.
There are no Liens for any material amount of Taxes (other than a Lien for
Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the Assets of any of the Veritex

an authority in a jurisdiction where any Veritex Entity does not file a Tax
Return that such Veritex Entity may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction.

(b) None of the Veritex Entities has received any written notice of assessment
or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and
there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims, audits,
examinations, investigations or other proceedings regarding any material Taxes

applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and the payment thereof

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each Veritex Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent
fiscal month end, materially exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (other than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance
sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) for such Veritex Entity and (ii) do
not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the Veritex
Entities in filing their Tax Returns.

(e) None of the Veritex Entities is a party to any Tax indemnity, allocation
or sharing agreement (other than any agreement solely between the Veritex
Entities and other than any customary Tax indemnifications contained in credit
or other commercial agreements the primary purpose of which agreements does
not relate to Taxes) and none of the Veritex Entities has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was Veritex) or has any Tax Liability of any
Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502 6 or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law (other than the other members of the consolidated
group of which Veritex is parent), or as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.

(f) During the two-year period ending on the date hereof, none of the Veritex
Entities was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Veritex was not a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Internal
Revenue Code.

(g) No Tax authority has required any of the Veritex Entities to include after
the Effective Time any material adjustment in taxable income pursuant to
Section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code or any comparable provision under
state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of transactions or events occurring
prior to the Effective Time. None of the Veritex Entities have participated in

disposed of since the date thereof in the Ordinary Course), free and clear of
all Liens, except Permitted Liens. Veritex is the fee simple owner of all
owned real property and the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the
most recent Veritex Financial Statements, free and clear of all Liens of any
nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and each such lease is valid

lessor.



5.12. Intellectual Property; Privacy.

and clear of any Liens other than any Permitted Liens) all of the Intellectual
Property used or held for use to carry on the business of such Veritex Entity
as it is currently conducted. To the extent a Veritex Entity engages in the
sale or licensing to a third party of any Intellectual Property in connection
with its business operations, such Veritex Entity is the owner of or has a
license, with the right to sublicense, such Intellectual Property as such
Intellectual Property is sold or licensed in the conduct of its business. No
Veritex Entity is in Default under any material Contract pursuant to which it
licenses Intellectual Property. Since January 1, 2015, no proceedings have
been instituted, or are pending or to the Knowledge of Veritex threatened,
which challenge the rights of any Veritex Entity with respect to Intellectual
Property used, sold or licensed by such Veritex Entity in the course of its
business, nor has any person claimed or alleged any rights to such
Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by a Veritex Entity. To
the Knowledge of Veritex, the conduct of the business of each Veritex Entity,
including any Veritex Entity's use of any Intellectual Property used or held
for use by such Veritex Entity does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or
otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights of any other Person. Since
January 1, 2015, no Veritex Entity has received any written notice from any
Person (i) alleging that any Veritex Entity has infringed, misappropriated,

or (ii) challenging the scope, validity, enforceability, registrability, use
or ownership of any Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by
any Veritex Entity.

(b) To the Knowledge of Veritex, no Person is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned, used, or held
for use by any Veritex Entity in the conduct of the respective businesses of
the Veritex Entities as currently conducted, and no such claims have been
asserted or threatened against any Person by any Veritex Entity since January
1, 2015.

(c) Veritex takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade
secrets, including requiring all Persons having access thereto to execute
written non-disclosure agreements. To the Knowledge of Veritex, there has not
been any disclosure of or access to any trade secret of any Veritex Entity
(including any such information of any other Person disclosed in confidence to
such Veritex Entity) to any Person in a manner that has resulted or is likely
to result in the loss of trade secret or other rights in and to such
information.

(d) (i) The computer, information technology and data processing systems,
facilities and services used by the Veritex Entities, including all Systems,
are reasonably sufficient for the conduct of the respective businesses of the
Veritex Entities as currently conducted and (ii) the Systems are in
sufficiently good working condition to effectively perform all computing,
information technology and data processing operations necessary for the
operation of the respective businesses of the Veritex Entities as currently
conducted. To 

Veritex's Knowledge, no third party has gained unauthorized access to any
Systems owned or controlled by any Veritex Entity since January 1, 2015. The
Veritex Entities have taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented
commercially reasonable safeguards (A) to protect the Systems from
unauthorized access and free from any disabling codes or instructions,
spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other software routines that permit
or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption, impairment, disablement, or
destruction of, software, data or other materials and (B) that are designed to
reasonably mitigate the risks of cybersecurity breaches and attacks. Each
Veritex Entity has implemented reasonably appropriate backup and disaster
recovery policies, procedures and systems consistent with generally accepted
industry standards and sufficient to reasonably mitigate the risk of a
material disruption to the operation of the respective businesses of the
Veritex Entities in all material respects.

(e) Each Veritex Entity has (i) complied in all material respects with (A) all
applicable Laws which govern the receipt, collection, compilation, use,
storage, processing, sharing, safeguarding, security, disposal, destruction,
disclosure or transfer of the personal information of customers or other
individuals and similar Laws governing data privacy, and (B) all of its
published privacy and data security policies and internal privacy and data
security policies and guidelines, including with respect to the collection,
storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure, destruction and use of personally
identifiable information and (ii) taken commercially reasonable measures to
ensure that all personally identifiable information in its possession or
control is protected against loss, damage, and unauthorized access, use,
modification, or other misuse. To Veritex's Knowledge, there has been no

misuse of any such information by any Veritex Entity or any other Person since
January 1, 2015.

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Veritex, since
January 1, 2015, no Litigation is or has been pending or, to the Knowledge of
Veritex, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority or
other forum in which any Veritex Entity or any of its Operating Properties or
Participation Facilities (or Veritex in respect of such Operating Property or

Hazardous Material, whether or not occurring at, on, under, adjacent to, or
affecting (or potentially affecting) a site currently or formerly owned,

or Participation Facilities, nor, to the Knowledge of Veritex, is there any
reasonable basis for any Litigation of a type described in this sentence.
Since January 1, 2015, no Veritex Entity is or has been subject to any Order
imposing any Liability or obligation with respect to any Environmental Law
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Veritex.

5.14. Compliance with Laws and Permits.

(a) Each Veritex Entity has, and since January 1, 2015, has had, in effect all
Permits necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its material Assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted (and have paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith), except where the failure to have in
effect any such Permit has not had or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Veritex.

Default under any such Permit and to the Knowledge of Veritex no suspension or

amendments thereto), or if such plan is not in writing, a written description
of such Veritex Benefit Plan.

(b) Each Veritex Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in all material
respects in compliance with the terms of such Veritex Benefit Plan and in all

Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter, or for a
prototype plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Veritex Benefit Plan and on which such Veritex Benefit Plan is
entitled to rely. No event has occurred and no circumstance exists that would

(other than routine claims for benefits) and no action, proceeding,
prosecution, inquiry or hearing has been commenced with respect to any Veritex
Benefit Plan.

(d) No Veritex Entity has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 406 of ERISA)
for which there is not an exemption with respect to any Veritex Benefit Plan,
and in any case, no prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any
Veritex Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code
being imposed on any Veritex Entity. No Veritex Entity has breached its
fiduciary duty with respect to a Veritex Benefit Plan in connection with any
acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or
investment of the assets of any Veritex Benefit Plan that would reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code being imposed on any Veritex Entity. To Veritex's
Knowledge, no other "fiduciary," within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA,
has breached his, her or its fiduciary duty with respect to a Veritex Benefit
Plan or otherwise has any liability in connection with any acts taken (or
failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or investment of the
assets of any Veritex Benefit Plan that would reasonably 

be expected to result in any material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or
the Internal Revenue Code being imposed on any Veritex Entity. All Veritex
Stock Options, and any other stock options granted by a Veritex Entity and
outstanding at any time within the last six years, were granted at no less
than "fair market value" for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code, and each such stock option has at all times been in compliance with or
exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(e) Neither Veritex nor any Veritex ERISA Affiliate has at any time been a
party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been obligated to
contribute to, or had any material liability with respect to, or would
reasonably be expected to have any such obligation to contribute to or
material liability with respect to: (i) any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA); (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code); or (iii) any voluntary employees'
beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code). Neither Veritex nor any Veritex ERISA Affiliate
currently provides any health benefits that are not fully insured by a third
party insurance company.

(f) Each Veritex Benefit Plan or other arrangement of a Veritex Entity that
constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code has been written, executed and operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations
thereunder.

(g) Each Veritex Benefit Plan that is a group health plan is in compliance in
all material respects with applicable requirements of the Affordable Care Act,
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-1(a)(3). No Veritex Entity
has or could reasonably be expected to have any material liability for Taxes
under Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code. No Veritex Entity has any
Liability or obligation to provide health, medical or life insurance benefits
to any current or former employee, officer, or director or other service
provider (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of any Veritex Entity after
his or her termination of employment or service with the Veritex Entities,
except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits continuation Laws
and for which the covered individual pays the full cost of coverage.

(h) No Veritex Benefit Plan is subject to Title VI of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Veritex Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Veritex Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full.

(j) Except as set forth on Section 5.16(j) of Veritex's Disclosure Memorandum,
to be completed within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will entitle any employee, officer,
director or other service provider of any Veritex Entity to any transaction
bonus, change in control payment or other similar payment, or accelerate the
time of payment or vesting of any such payment that would constitute a
"parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code).
No Veritex Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Sections 4999 or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(k) There are no loans outstanding between the Veritex ESOP and any other
Person, other than participant loans in accordance with the participant loan
policies of the Veritex ESOP. The Veritex ESOP has at all times been primarily
invested in "employer securities" as defined in Section 409(l) of the Internal 

Revenue Code, and has never acquired or held any employer security that was
not a "qualifying employer security" as defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA.

or operations, is a party to, or is bound by any Contract, (a) that is a

S-K of the SEC) required to have been filed as an exhibit to one of the
Veritex SEC Reports and that has not yet been filed, (b) that prohibits or
materially restricts any Veritex Entity (or, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation) from
engaging in any business activities in any geographic area, line of business
or otherwise in competition with any other Person, (c) that limits the payment
of dividends by any Veritex Entity, (d) pursuant to which any Veritex Entity

and that contains representations, covenants, indemnities or other obligations
(including indemnification, "earn-out" or other contingent obligations) that
are still in effect, (e) between any Veritex Entity, on the one hand, and (i)
any officer or director of any Veritex Entity, or (ii) to the Knowledge of
Veritex, any (x) record or beneficial owner of five percent or more of the
voting securities of Veritex, (y) Affiliate or family member of any such
officer, director or record or beneficial owner or (z) any other Affiliate of
Veritex, on the other hand, in each case, except the Veritex Benefit Plans or

any Person, except for non-material Contracts entered into in the Ordinary
Course, (g) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective

Loan Bank and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, in each case
incurred in the Ordinary Course) in the principal amount of $2,000,000 or more
including any sale and leaseback transactions, capitalized leases and other
similar financing transactions, (k) that is a consulting agreement or data
processing, software programming or licensing contract involving the payment
of more than $250,000 per annum (other than any such contracts that are
terminable by a Veritex Entity on 60 days or less notice without any required
payment or other conditions, other than the condition of notice), (l) any
partnership or joint venture Contract, (m) that involves aggregate payments or
receipts by or to Veritex or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $250,000 in
any 12-month period, other than those terminable on 60 days or less notice
without payment by Veritex or any Subsidiary of Veritex of any material
penalty or (n) any other Contract or amendment thereto that is material to any
Veritex Entity or their respective business or Assets and not otherwise
entered into in the Ordinary Course. Each Contract of the type described in
this Section 5.17, whether or not set forth in Veritex's Disclosure
Memorandum, are referred to herein as the "Veritex Contracts". With respect to
each Veritex Contract: (i) the Contract is legal, valid and binding on a
Veritex Entity and is in full force and effect and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms; (ii) no Veritex Entity is in Default thereunder;
(iii) no Veritex Entity has repudiated or waived any material provision of any
such Contract; and (iv) no other party to any such Contract is, to the
Knowledge of Veritex, in Default or has repudiated or waived any provision
thereunder, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Veritex. All of
the Veritex Contracts have been Previously Disclosed. All of the indebtedness
of any Veritex Entity for money borrowed is prepayable at any time by such
Veritex Entity without penalty or premium.

No Veritex Entity is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter, safety and soundness compliance plan, or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil
money penalty by, or has been a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or

suggestion of any Regulatory Authority that currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or
risk management policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not
set forth in Veritex's Disclosure Memorandum, a "Veritex Regulatory
Agreement"), nor has any Veritex Entity been advised in writing or, to
Veritex's Knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2015, by any Regulatory
Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting
any such Veritex Regulatory Agreement.

5.19. Derivative Instruments and Transactions.

All Derivative Transactions whether entered into for the account of any
Veritex Entity or for the account of a customer of any Veritex Entity (a) were
entered into in the Ordinary Course and in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of all applicable
Regulatory Authorities, (b) are legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Veritex Entity party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Veritex, each of the
counterparties thereto, and (c) are in full force and effect and enforceable
in accordance with their terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought). The Veritex Entities and, to the Knowledge of Veritex, the
counterparties to all such Derivative Transactions, have duly performed, in
all material respects, their obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued. To the Knowledge of Veritex, there are no
material breaches, violations or Defaults or allegations or assertions of such

Veritex, threatened against any Veritex Entity, or against any current or
former director, officer or employee of a Veritex Entity in their capacities
as such or Employee Benefit Plan of any Veritex Entity, or against any Asset,
interest, or right of any of them, nor are there any Orders outstanding
against any Veritex Entity, in each case, that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Veritex. Section 5.20(a) of Veritex's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a

Veritex Entity.



5.21. Statements True and Correct.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by any Veritex Entity
or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion (including by incorporation by
reference) in the Registration Statement to be filed by Veritex with the SEC
will, when supplied or when the Registration Statement becomes effective (or
when incorporated by reference), be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The portions of the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus relating to Veritex Entities and other portions
within the reasonable control of Veritex Entities will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

(b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by any Veritex Entity
or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion (including by incorporation by
reference) in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus, and any other documents to be filed

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, at the respective

incorporated by reference), and with respect to the Joint Proxy/Prospectus,
when first mailed to the shareholders of Veritex, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or, in the case of the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the Veritex
Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the Veritex
Meeting.

5.22. State Takeover Statutes and Takeover Provisions.

Veritex has taken all action required to be taken by it in order to exempt
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from, and this

requirements of any Takeover Statutes. No Veritex Entity is the beneficial
owner (directly or indirectly) of more than 10% of the outstanding capital
stock of Green entitled to vote in the election of Green's directors.

5.23. Opinion of Financial Advisor.

Veritex's board of directors has received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc., which, if initially rendered verbally has been or will be
confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date, to the effect that, as of
the date of such opinion and subject to the factors, assumptions and
limitations set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair, from
a financial point of view, to Veritex. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

5.24. Tax and Regulatory Matters.

No Veritex Entity has taken or agreed to take any action, and Veritex does not
have any Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is
reasonably likely to prevent the Holdco Mergers, taken together, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. No Veritex Entity or, to the Knowledge of Veritex, any
Affiliate thereof has taken or agreed to take any action, and Veritex does not
have any Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is
reasonably likely to materially impede or delay receipt of any of the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(a) No Veritex Entity is a party to any Loan in which any Veritex Entity is a
creditor that as of March 31, 2018, had an outstanding balance of $250,000 or
more and under the terms of which the obligor was, as of June 30, 2018, over
90 days or more delinquent in payment of principal or interest. Except as such
disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, Section 5.25(a) of Veritex's
Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all of
the Loans of the Veritex Entities that, as of March 31, 2018 had an
outstanding balance of $250,000 or more and were classified by Veritex as
"Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard,"
"Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets,"
"Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar import, together with the
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the
aggregate principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as
of such date.

(b) Each Loan currently outstanding (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or
other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport
to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens which have
been perfected, and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except in all
cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other credit or security
documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of origination or
purchase by a Veritex Entity and are valid and enforceable in all material
respects.

(c) Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to investors) was
solicited and originated, and is and has been administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are being maintained, in all
material respects in accordance with the relevant notes or other credit or
security documents, Veritex's written underwriting standards (and, in the case
of Loans held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards (if any) of
the applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of Laws.

(d) None of the Contracts pursuant to which any Veritex Entity has sold Loans
or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans contains any
obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of
a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

(e) (i) Section 5.25(e) of Veritex's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a list
of all Loans as of the date hereof by Veritex to any directors, executive
officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are defined in Regulation O
of the Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of any Veritex Entity, (ii) there
are no employee, officer, director, principal shareholder or other affiliate
Loans on which the borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the
note or other relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower
is paying a rate which was not in compliance with Regulation O, and (iii) all
such Loans are and were originated in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Laws.

(f) No Veritex Entity is now nor has it been since January 1, 2015 subject to
any material fine, suspension, settlement or other Contract or other
administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase
commitment from, any Regulatory Authority relating to the origination, sale or
servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.





5.26. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

The ALLL reflected in the Veritex Financial Statements was, as of the date of
each of the Veritex Financial Statements, in the reasonable opinion of
management of Veritex, (a) in compliance with Veritex's existing methodology
for determining the adequacy of the ALLL and in compliance in all material
respects with the standards established by the applicable Regulatory
Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and GAAP and (b) adequate
to meet all reasonably anticipated loan and lease losses, net of recoveries
related to loans previously charged off as of those dates.

5.27. Brokers and Finders.

Except for Stephens Inc. and Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., neither Veritex
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, or Affiliates has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any Liability for any financial advisory fees,

would be borne by any Veritex Entity prior to the Closing or the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger Transactions in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

of five percent or more of the voting securities of Veritex or (ii) Affiliate
or family member of any such officer, director or record or beneficial owner,
or (c) any other Affiliate of Veritex, on the other hand, in each case, except
those of a type available to employees of Veritex generally and the Veritex
Benefit Plans.

5.29. No Other Representations and Warranties

(a) Except for the representations and warranties in this ARTICLE 5, Veritex
and Merger Sub do not make any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Veritex Entities, or their respective businesses,

(a) Veritex and Green shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC (no later
than 40 days after the date of this Agreement) the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and
Veritex shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement
(including the joint proxy statement and prospectus (the "Joint
Proxy/Prospectus")) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, subject to the immediately following sentence. Veritex and
Green agree to cooperate, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with the other and its counsel and its accountants in the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus. Each
of Veritex and Green agrees to (i) use its respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof,
(ii) keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) promptly
thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy/Prospectus to its respective
shareholders. Veritex also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Green shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, furnish all
information concerning Green and the holders of Green Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

(b) Each of Green and Veritex shall duly call, give notice of, establish a
record date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (the "Green Meeting"
and the "Veritex Meeting" respectively), to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC,
for the purpose of obtaining the Green Shareholder Approval and the Veritex
Shareholder Approval and the approval of such other matters of the type
customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders. Green
and Veritex shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate to
hold the Green Meeting and the Veritex Meeting on the same day and at the same
time and to set the same record date for each such meeting.

(c) Subject to Section 7.2, the board of directors of each of Green and
Veritex shall (i) recommend to its respective shareholders the approval of (A)
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of Green
(the "Green Recommendation"), and (B) the Veritex Share Issuance, in the case
of Veritex (the "Veritex Recommendation"), (ii) include such Green
Recommendation and Veritex Recommendation in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus, and
(iii) use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain (x) in the case of
Green, the Green Shareholder Approval, and (y) in the case of Veritex, the
Veritex Shareholder Approval.

(d) Subject to Section 7.2(d), neither the board of directors of Green nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Veritex, the Green Recommendation or take any action, or make any public
statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Green Recommendation, or
submit this Agreement to the Green's 

shareholders without recommendation (any of the foregoing being a "Change in
the Green Recommendation").

(e) Neither the board of directors of Veritex nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Green, the Veritex
Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or
release inconsistent with the Veritex Recommendation, or submit the Veritex
Share Issuance to the Veritex's shareholders without recommendation.

(f) Green or Veritex, as applicable, shall adjourn or postpone its respective
shareholders' meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Green Common Stock or Veritex Common Stock,
as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Green or Veritex
shall also adjourn or postpone its respective shareholders' meeting if, as of
the time for which such meeting is scheduled, Green or Veritex, as the case
may be, has not recorded proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Green Shareholder Approval or the Veritex Shareholder
Approval, respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each
of the Veritex Meeting and Green Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of Veritex and Green at the
Veritex Meeting and Green Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on
the approval of this Agreement and the Veritex Share Issuance, as applicable,
and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve either Veritex or Green of such obligation.

7.2. Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Subject to Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(d), no Green Entity shall, and they
shall cause their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage (including by providing information or assistance),
facilitate or induce any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished
to any Person any confidential or nonpublic information or data with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or
recommend, or propose to approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary or
Representative of Green shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2 by
Green. Subject to Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(d), in addition to the foregoing,
Green shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.2(a), if Green or
any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by any Person at any time prior to the Green Shareholder
Approval that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of
Section 7.2(a), the Green Entities and their Representatives may, prior to
(but not after) the Green Shareholder Approval, take the following actions if
the board of directors of Green (or any duly and properly authorized committee
thereof) has (i) determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with Green's financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions by the board of
directors of Green (or any duly and properly authorized committee thereof)
would reasonably likely cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms (with respect to each provision) at least as
restrictive with respect to such Person 

as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to Veritex (and
such confidentiality agreement shall not provide such Person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with Green): (A) furnish information to (but only
if Green shall have provided such information to Veritex prior to furnishing
it to any such Person), and (B) enter into discussions and negotiations with,
such Person with respect to such unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal.

(c) Promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, Green
shall advise Veritex in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), and Green shall as
promptly as practicable provide to Veritex (i) a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral.
Green shall provide Veritex as promptly as practicable (but in no event more
than 24 hours) with notice setting forth all such information as is necessary
to keep Veritex informed on a current basis of all developments, discussions,
negotiations and communications regarding (including amendments or proposed
amendments to) such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Green Meeting, the board of directors of Green may make a Change in the Green
Recommendation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, approving, endorsing or
recommending any Acquisition Proposal), if (A) Green has received a Superior
Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by Veritex
pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)), and (B) the board of directors of Green has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be a violation of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the board of directors
of Green may not take the actions set forth in this Section 7.2(d) unless:

(i) Green has complied in all material respects with the terms of this Section
7.2 applicable to Green;

(ii) Green has provided Veritex at least five days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the events or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including
all necessary information under Section 7.2(c));

(iii) during such five-day period, Green has and has caused its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to, consider and negotiate with Veritex in
good faith (to the extent Veritex desires to so negotiate) regarding any
proposals, adjustments or modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Veritex; and

(iv) the board of directors of Green has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, considering the results of the
negotiations contemplated in Section 7.2(d)(iii) and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications proposed by Veritex (if any) that such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a
Change in the Green Recommendation would be a violation of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in which event, the board of
directors of Green may communicate the basis for its lack of Green
Recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law;
provided, that the resolution approving this Agreement as of the date hereof
may not be rescinded or amended. 

Any material amendment to any Superior Proposal (including any amendment to
the value of, or change to the type of, consideration that would be payable to
holders of Green Common Stock in the Superior Proposal), will be deemed to be
a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2(d) and will require a
new determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 7.2(d).

(e) Promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt of any
Veritex Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Veritex Acquisition
Proposal, Veritex shall advise Green in writing of the receipt of such Veritex
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such
Veritex Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the
identity of the Person making any such Veritex Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry), and Veritex shall, as promptly as practicable provide to Green a
written summary of the material terms of such Veritex Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. Veritex shall provide Green as promptly as practicable
(but in no event more than 24 hours) with notice setting forth all such
information as is necessary to keep Green informed on a current basis of all
developments, discussions, negotiations and communications regarding
(including amendments or proposed amendments to) such Veritex Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

(f) Green and the Green Subsidiaries shall, and Green shall direct its
Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any offer or proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to any Person (other than Veritex and its Representatives) that has
made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) not
waive or amend any "standstill" provision or provisions of similar effect to
which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary and shall strictly enforce
any such provisions.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Green or its board of
directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
from making any legally required disclosure to the shareholders of Green;
provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

7.3. Exchange Listing.

Veritex shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of Veritex
Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Green Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger, and Veritex shall give all notices and make all filings with Nasdaq
required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

7.4. Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

(a) Veritex and Green shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with each other and all Regulatory Authorities and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
documentation (and, in the case of the regulatory applications to the Federal
Reserve, within 30 days after the date of this Agreement or such later time
period as a Regulatory Authority may advise), to effect all applications,
notices and filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger Transactions), and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all such third parties and Regulatory Authorities. Each of Veritex and Green
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections (if any) 

that may be asserted with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or Order or by any applicable
Regulatory Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any
Veritex Entities be required, and the Green Entities shall not be permitted
(without Veritex's prior written consent in its sole discretion), to take any
action, or commit to take any action, or to accept any restriction, commitment
or condition, involving the Veritex Entities or the Green Entities, which
would reasonably be expected to be materially financially burdensome to the
business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (any such
restriction, commitment or condition, a "Burdensome Condition").

(b) Each of Veritex and Green shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult with (and consider in good faith
the comments and input of) the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all written
information submitted to any third party or Regulatory Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each Party agrees that it will consult with the other Party
with respect to the obtaining of all Permits and Consents of third parties and
Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other Party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly advising the other Party upon
receiving any communication (whether written or oral) from a Regulatory
Authority the Consent of which is required for the consummation of the Merger
Transactions and/or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which communication causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any required consent or approval from a Regulatory Authority
will not be obtained or that the receipt of such consent or approval may be
materially delayed. Each Party shall consult with the other Party in advance
of any meeting or conference with any Regulatory Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted
by such Regulatory Authority, give the other Party and its counsel the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws, to promptly
furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or Regulatory Authority.

7.5. Access to Information; Confidentiality and Notification of Certain
Matters.

(a) Green and Veritex shall each promptly advise the other of any fact,
change, event or circumstance (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.5(a) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2
or 8.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by
the Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Green and Veritex shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives
of the other Party, access during normal business hours to its books, records,
Contracts, properties and personnel and such other information as the other
Party 

may reasonably request and furnish to the other Party promptly all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
Party may reasonably request, provided that such access or requests shall not
unreasonably interfere with normal operations of the Party. No investigation
by either Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to such Party's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Green nor Veritex nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Green's or Veritex's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or
contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

(c) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
hold and use any information obtained in connection with this Agreement and in
pursuit of the transactions contemplates hereby in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 2, 2018, between Veritex and Green
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").

7.6. Press Releases.

Green and Veritex shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or other public disclosure or communication (including communications
to employees, agents and contractors) related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue such press release or
other public disclosure without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any
Party from making any press release or other public disclosure (i) required by
Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United States
securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or
disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party
reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of the
issuance thereof, or (ii) substantially similar to communications previously
approved pursuant to this Section 7.6. The Parties have agreed upon the form
of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

7.7. Tax Treatment.

(a) Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to, (1) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Holdco Mergers, taken together, and (2)
to take no action which would cause the Holdco Mergers, taken together, not,
in each case, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. The
Parties adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354,
361 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(b) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
appropriate officers to execute and deliver to Covington and Burling LLP and
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, respectively, certificates
containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by such counsel, including as of the effective date of
the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the Closing Date, in connection with such
counsel's deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the
Holdco Mergers. 

(c) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of Veritex and Green
shall report the Holdco Mergers, taken together, as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take
any inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

7.8. Employee Benefits and Contracts.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier,
until the date of termination of the applicable Covered Employee following the
Effective Time), Veritex shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide to employees who are employed by a Green Entity immediately prior to
the Effective Time who continue to be employed by Veritex or the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time ("Covered Employees")
with employee benefits under Veritex Benefit Plans, on terms and conditions
which are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided by
Veritex Entities to their similarly situated employees, including severance
benefits (other than to any Covered Employee who is party to individual
agreements or letters that entitle such person to different severance or
termination benefits); provided, that in no event shall any Covered Employee
be eligible to participate in any Veritex Entity to the extent such plan is
closed or frozen as of the date hereof. In addition, without limiting the
foregoing, Veritex shall pay the amount of any cash bonus or commission that
may become payable to the Covered Employees pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Green Benefit Plans for fiscal year 2018, to the extent not paid as
of Closing, to be paid in accordance with the terms of such applicable Green
Benefit Plan. Until such time as Veritex shall cause the Covered Employees to
participate in the applicable Veritex Benefit Plans, the continued
participation of the Covered Employees in the Green Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it being understood
that participation in Veritex Benefit Plans may commence at different times
with respect to each of Veritex Benefit Plans). For purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting under Veritex Benefit Plans, and for
purposes of determining a Covered Employee's entitlement to paid time off
under Veritex's paid time off program, the service of the Covered Employees
with a Green Entity prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service
with a Veritex Entity participating in such Veritex Benefit Plans, to the same
extent that such service was recognized by the Green Entities for purposes of
a similar benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not
(i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to
the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which Veritex has not previously provided such
recognition of service to similarly situated acquired employees in acquisition
transactions, (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation, or (z) for purposes of retiree medical
benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of
Section 7.8(a), with respect to each Covered Employee (and their
beneficiaries) Veritex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of Veritex or its
Subsidiaries in which each such Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate (collectively, the "Veritex Welfare Benefit Plans") (to the extent
permitted by the applicable carrier) to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under an analogous plan
of the Green Entities, (ii) provide credit under the applicable Veritex
Welfare Benefit Plan for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Covered Employees (and their beneficiaries) under an
analogous plan of the Green Entities prior to the Effective Time during the
portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive
any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work requirement or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Covered
Employees and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent
such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous plan of the Green Entities prior to the
Effective Time. 

(c) If requested by Veritex in a writing delivered to Green following the date
hereof and no later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Green Entities shall take all necessary action (including without limitation
the adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any
required notices) to terminate, effective as of no later than the day before
the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, any Green
Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code with a
cash or deferred feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (a
"401(k) Plan"). Green shall provide Veritex with an advance copy of the
resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the termination of the 401(k) Plans and give Veritex a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered
in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Green shall provide Veritex
with the final documentation evidencing that the 401(k) Plans have been
terminated. If a 401(k) Plan is terminated, Veritex shall designate a tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred
arrangement that is sponsored by the Veritex or one of its Subsidiaries (the
"Veritex 401(k) Plan") that will cover Green employees effective within 60
Business Days following the Closing Date. In connection with the termination
of the 401(k) Plan, Veritex shall make commercially reasonable efforts, except
as would endanger the qualified status of the Veritex 401(k) Plan, to cause
the Veritex 401(k) Plan to accept from each terminated 401(k) Plan the "direct
rollover" of the account balance (including the in-kind rollover of promissory
notes evidencing all outstanding participant loans and after-tax and Roth
amounts if such contributions types are permitted by the terms of the
applicable Veritex plan) of each Green employee who participated in a
terminated 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated and who elects
such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of such 401(k) Plan and the
Internal Revenue Code. Veritex and Green shall cooperate in good faith to take
commercially reasonable actions needed, except as would endanger the qualified
status of the Veritex 401(k) Plan, to permit each Green employee with an
outstanding loan balance under terminated 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan
is terminated to continue to make scheduled loan payments to such 401(k) Plan
after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the
promissory notes evidencing such loans from the terminated 401(k) Plan to the
Veritex 401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to
prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan
offset with respect to such outstanding loans.

(d) Subject to compliance with Section 7.8(a), upon request by Veritex in
writing prior to the Closing Date, the Green Entities shall cooperate in good
faith with Veritex prior to the Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or
modify any other Green Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined
by Veritex effective upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually
agreed to by the parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Green shall
provide Veritex with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and
other documents prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
Section 7.8(d), as applicable, and give Green a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith),
and prior to the Closing Date, Green shall provide Veritex with the final
documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been
effectuated.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 7.8 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
that nothing in this Section 7.8, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person, including any current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant of Green or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any third-
party beneficiary or other rights under or by reason of this Section 7.8. In
no event shall the terms of this Section 7.8: (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Green Benefit Plan, Veritex Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Veritex, Green or
any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Surviving Corporation, Veritex or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any Green Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant 

of Green or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right to employment or
continued employment or continued service with Veritex or any Veritex
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or the Green Entities, or constitute
or create an employment agreement with any employee, or interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Green, Veritex or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of
any employee, officer, director or consultant of Green or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause.

7.9. Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Veritex and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors or officers or employees of the Green Entities (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to, the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Green Entities or, at
Green's request, of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise and pertaining to matters,
acts or omissions arising, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a "Claim"), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to repay
such advances if it is determined in a final determination or judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) Veritex shall maintain in effect for a period of six years after the
Effective Time Green's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy (provided that Veritex may substitute therefor (i) policies with a
reputable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous to the
insured or (ii) with the written consent of Green given prior to the Effective
Time, any other policy) with respect to Claims arising from facts or events
which occurred at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Veritex shall
not be obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period
in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed,
for the portion related to Green's directors and officers, 250% of the annual
premium payments currently paid on Green's current policy in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premium
payments necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Veritex shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance that are the most
advantageous to the insured and obtainable for a premium less than or equal to
the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Veritex, or Green in
consultation with Veritex, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described
in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the
premium necessary to purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Veritex (or Green in consultation with Veritex) may purchase the
"tail" prepaid policy that is the most advantageous to the insured and
obtainable for a premium less than or equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each
case, Veritex shall have no further obligations under this Section 7.9(b)
other than to maintain in full force and effect such "tail" prepaid policy.

(c) If Veritex or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of
such consolidation or merger or if Veritex (or any successors or assigns)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and
in each case, 

proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Veritex
shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs
and Representatives.

7.10. Operating Functions.

To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Green and Green Bank shall
cooperate with Veritex and Veritex Bank in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of the Parties and the operation of the
Surviving Bank, and in preparing for the consolidation of appropriate
operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such later date
as Veritex may decide. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in
preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations generally (including by entering into
customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such
service providers or the other Party). Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operations of any other Party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Article 6, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

7.11. Shareholder Litigation.

Each of Green and Veritex shall promptly notify the other in writing of any
action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena
or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or
otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator pending or, to the
Knowledge of Green or Veritex, as applicable, threatened against Green,
Veritex or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken
by Green, Veritex or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or
thereto or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Green or Veritex, as applicable, shall give
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to participate (at such other Party's
own expense) in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation
against Green or Veritex or their respective directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without such other Party's prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

7.12. Legal Conditions to Merger Transactions; Additional Agreements.

(a) Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Green and
Veritex shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and
regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger Transactions and, subject to the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain)
any Consent or Order by, any Regulatory Authority and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by Green or Veritex or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with, or to effect, the Merger Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a
Subsidiary of Veritex, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Green, on the
other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any 

of the Parties to the Merger Transactions, the proper officers and directors
of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Veritex.

(b) Green shall terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, each Investor
Agreement; provided that any indemnification obligations arising under such
Investor Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall survive such termination
in accordance with their terms.

(c) Green shall (i) place "stop orders" on its books to prevent any transfer
of Green Common Stock held by any Green shareholder party to a Green Voting
Agreement and (ii) decline to make (and instruct any duly appointed transfer
agent for the registration or transfer of Green Common Stock to decline to
make) any such transfer of Green Common Stock, in each case if such transfer
would constitute a violation or breach of such shareholder's applicable Green
Voting Agreement.

7.13. Dividends.

After the date of this Agreement, each of Veritex and Green shall coordinate
with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in respect of
Veritex Common Stock and Green Common Stock and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that holders of
Green Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one
dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Green Common Stock
and any shares of Veritex Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

7.14. Change of Method.

Either Party may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of
Green and Veritex (including by providing for the merger of Green with and
into Veritex) if and to the extent requested by either Party, and the other
party agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as such Party may
reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided,
that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind
of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely
affect the Tax treatment of the Holdco Mergers with respect to Green's
shareholders, or (iii) materially delay or impede the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.15. Restructuring Efforts.

If either Green or Veritex shall have failed to obtain the Green Shareholder
Approval or the Veritex Shareholder Approval, as applicable, at the duly
convened Green Meeting or Veritex Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, each of the Parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
provided for herein (it being understood that neither Party shall have any
obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind
of the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such Party or its
shareholders or adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger Transactions
with respect to the Green's shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
Section 7.15) to its respective shareholders for approval).

7.16. Corporate Governance.

Effective as of the Effective Time, Veritex shall take all actions necessary
to cause the size of the board of directors of Veritex to be nine directors,
with such reconstituted board of directors of Veritex consisting of six
members of the board of directors of Veritex as of the Effective Time and
three members of the board of directors of Green as of the Effective Time
(which shall be Manuel Mehos, Steve Lerner and 

Don Ellis (the "Green Continuing Directors")). The board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall cause the
Green Continuing Directors to be nominated for election at the next annual
meeting of shareholders of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time.

7.17. Takeover Statutes.

Neither Veritex, Merger Sub nor Green shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
Transactions, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each
of Veritex, Merger Sub and Green shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Veritex, Merger
Sub and Green will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

7.18. Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).

Green and Veritex agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of Green subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "Green Insiders"), both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Green Insiders not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the
conversion of shares of Green Common Stock in the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and
retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 7.18. The boards of
directors of Veritex and of Green, or a committee of non-employee directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), shall promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time,
take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any
dispositions of Green Common Stock and (ii) any acquisitions of Veritex Common
Stock, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the treatment of the Green equity awards under Section
2.4) and by any Green Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
employees, officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law.

7.19. Assumption of Green Subordinated Notes.

Simultaneous with the consummation of the Merger Transactions, Veritex shall
assume Green's 8.5% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due 2026 in
accordance with the provisions governing such notes.

ARTICLE 9

TERMINATION



9.1. Termination.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time (regardless of whether the Veritex Shareholder Approval and/or
the Green Shareholder Approval have been obtained):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Veritex and Green;

(b) by either Party, by written notice to the other Party, in the event (i)
any Regulatory Authority has denied a Requisite Regulatory Approval and such
denial has become final and nonappealable, or any Regulatory Authority shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger Transactions, and
such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and nonappealable;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with Section 7.5
or any other provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, such action, (ii) the shareholders of Green fail to approve the matters
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at the
Green Meeting where such matters were presented to such Green shareholders for
approval and voted upon (taking into account any adjournment or postponement
thereof as required by this Agreement) or (iii) the shareholders of Veritex
fail to approve the matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Veritex Meeting where such matters were presented
to such Veritex shareholders for approval and voted upon (taking into account
any adjournment or postponement thereof as required by this Agreement);

(c) by either Party, by written notice to the other Party, in the event that
the Merger Transactions shall not have been consummated by the one-year
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, if the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on or before such date is not caused by any
breach of this Agreement by the Party electing to terminate pursuant to this
Section 9.1(c);

directors of Green has (i) failed to make the Green Recommendation or

breached its obligations under Section 7.1 solely by failing to call, give
notice of, convene or hold the Veritex Meeting in accordance with Section 7.1;

(f) by either Party, by written notice to the other Party (provided that the
terminating Party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have
been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Green, in the
case of a termination by Veritex, or Veritex, in the case of a termination by
Green, which breach or failure to be true, individually or in the aggregate
with all other breaches by such Party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing 

Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2, in the case of a
termination by Veritex, or Section 8.3, in the case of a termination by Green,
and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to Green, in
the case of a termination by Veritex, or Veritex, in the case of a termination
by Green, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the date specified in Section 9.1(c));

Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) if such Party shall have used its
reasonable best efforts until the earlier of (i) 60 days following the grant
of such Requisite Regulatory Approval containing a Burdensome Condition, or
(ii) the one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement, to cause the

Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and
any plural term the singular. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation." The word "or" shall not be exclusive and "any"
means "any and all." The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and
similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific
Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine,
feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may require. If a word
or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of such word or phrase have
a corresponding meaning. A reference to a document, agreement or instrument
also refers to all addenda, exhibits or schedules thereto. A reference to any
"copy" or "copies" of a document, agreement or instrument means a copy or
copies that are complete and correct. Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all accounting terms used in this Agreement will be interpreted,
and all accounting determinations under this Agreement will be made, in
accordance with GAAP. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule, Exhibit or
Disclosure Memorandum but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning
set forth in this Agreement. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this
Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement" (or similar phrases) include the transactions
provided for in this Agreement, including the Merger Transactions. Any
Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any Contract that is
referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law and
references to 

all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The term "made
available" means any document or other information that was (a) provided
(whether by physical or electronic delivery) by one Party or its
representatives to the other Party or its representatives at least two
Business Days prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual data room
(on a continuation basis without subsequent modification) of a Party at least
two Business Days prior to the date hereof, or (c) filed by a Party with the
SEC and publicly available on EDGAR at least two Business Days prior to the
date hereof.

10.3. Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3, each of the Parties
shall bear and pay all direct costs and expenses incurred by it or on its
behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
filing, registration and application fees, printing and mailing fees, and fees
and expenses of its own financial or other consultants, investment bankers,
accountants, and counsel, except that each of the Parties shall bear and pay
one-half of the filing fees payable in connection with the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and printing costs incurred in
connection with the printing of the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a),

(i) if (1) either Green or Veritex terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b)(ii) or 9.1(c) (and the Green Shareholder Approval has not been
obtained) or Veritex terminates pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and (2) in each
case, prior to such termination, any Person has made an Acquisition Proposal
or has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, and within 12 months of such termination Green shall
either (A) consummate an Acquisition Transaction or (B) enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, whether or
not such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated and, in each
case, whether or not relating to the same Acquisition Proposal that had been
made or publicly announced prior to such termination; or

(ii) Veritex shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d),

then Green shall pay to Veritex an amount equal to $40,000,000 (the
"Termination Fee"). If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to
subsection (i) of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be paid in
same-day funds at or prior to the earlier of the date of consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction or the date of execution of an Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Transaction. If the Termination Fee shall be
payable pursuant to subsection (ii) of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination
Fee shall be paid in same-day funds within two Business Days from the date of
termination of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a),

(i) if (1) either Green or Veritex terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b)(iii) (and the Veritex Shareholder Approval has not been
obtained) and (2) prior to such termination, any Person has made a Veritex
Acquisition Proposal or has publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Veritex Acquisition Proposal, and within 12 months of
such termination Veritex shall either (A) consummate a Veritex Acquisition
Transaction or (B) enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Veritex Acquisition Transaction, whether or not such Veritex Acquisition
Transaction is subsequently consummated and, in each case, whether or not
relating to the same Veritex Acquisition Proposal that had been made or
publicly announced prior to such termination; or 

(ii) Green shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e),

then Veritex shall pay to Green the Termination Fee. If the Termination Fee
shall be payable pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 10.3(c), the
Termination Fee shall be paid in same-day funds at or prior to the earlier of
the date of consummation of such Veritex Acquisition Transaction or the date
of execution of an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Veritex
Acquisition Transaction. If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to
subsection (ii) of this Section 10.3(c), the Termination Fee shall be paid in
same-day funds within two Business Days from the date of termination of this
Agreement.

(d) The payment of the Termination Fee by Green or Veritex pursuant to Section
10.3(b) or Section 10.3(c), as applicable, constitutes liquidated damages and
not a penalty, and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Veritex or Green, as
the case may be, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c), 9.1(d), 9.1(e), or 9.1(f) in the
event the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 10.3(b) or Section
10.3(c), as applicable. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Green or Veritex, as
applicable, fails to pay any fee payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.3
when due, then Green or Veritex, as applicable, shall pay to Veritex or Green,
as applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in
connection with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of
the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was due
under this Agreement until the date of payment.

10.4. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including
Green's Disclosure Memorandum, Veritex's Disclosure Memorandum, the Exhibits,
the schedules, and the other documents and instruments hereto) together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Subsidiary Plan of Merger and the Voting
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder and supersedes all
prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereto, written or oral.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person, other than the Parties or their respective successors or assigns, any
rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than as specifically provided in Sections 7.9 and 7.16
(which, after the Effective Time, in the case of Section 7.16, shall be for
the benefit of the Green Continuing Directors). The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other
than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any third party
beneficiary will be required to amend, modify to waive any provision of this
Agreement, other than, following the Effective Time, Sections 7.9 and 7.16.

(c) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any employee
benefit plan, program, or document (each, a "Benefit Plan") unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" or "creates" that
Benefit Plan, and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this 

Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or a creation of, a
Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement
rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to
this Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a Person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a Benefit
Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or creation
despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that
provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having any
effect.

10.5. Amendments.

To the extent permitted by Law, this Agreement may be amended by a subsequent
writing executed by each of the Parties, whether before or after the Green
Shareholder Approval or Veritex Shareholder Approval has been obtained;
provided, that after obtaining the Green Shareholder Approval or Veritex
Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that requires further
approval by such shareholders under applicable Law.

10.6. Waivers.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; provided, that after the
Green Shareholder Approval or Veritex Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension
or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further
shareholder approval under applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition.

10.7. Assignment.

Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall
be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

10.8. Notices.

All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered by hand, by facsimile
transmission (followed by overnight courier), by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid), or by courier or
overnight carrier (with proof of service), or by email (with receipt
confirmed) to the persons at the addresses set forth below (or at such other
address as may be provided hereunder), and shall be deemed to have been
delivered as of the date so delivered:

10.9. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

(a) The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas without
regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles that might
otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the
substantive Law of another jurisdiction.

(b) Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction located in the State of Texas (the "Chosen Courts"), and, solely
in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions
that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to
laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party, and (iv) agrees that service of process
upon such party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice
is given in accordance with Section 10.8. 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NEGOTIATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.9.

10.10. Counterparts; Signatures.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to) raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement
or any amendment or waiver hereto or any agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement or the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

10.11. Captions; Articles and Sections.

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles, Exhibits or Sections shall mean and refer to the
referenced Articles, Exhibits and Sections of this Agreement.

10.12. Interpretations.

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be considered the
draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and
interpreted according to their ordinary meaning so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of all Parties.





10.13. Enforcement of Agreement; Remedies Cumulative.

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting bond, to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at Law or in equity shall be cumulative
and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any
thereof by any Party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of
any other such rights, powers or remedies by such Party.

10.14. Severability.

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.
