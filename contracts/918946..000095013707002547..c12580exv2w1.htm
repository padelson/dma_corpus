 6.16 ShareholderÂ’s Indemnification Rights under the June Stock Purchase Agreement. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the Closing, Shareholder hereby transfers and assigns to Parent all of its rights to indemnification under that certain Share Sale and Purchase Agreement dated June 13, 2006 by and between Shareholder and the former shareholders of Target (the "June Stock Purchase Agreement"). In the event that any such transfer or assignment is limited or not permitted pursuant to the June Stock Purchase Agreement and in the event that a Parent Indemnitee seeks indemnification for any Losses under Section 11 herein, Shareholder shall from and after the Closing, at the direction of Parent and as promptly as practicable after ShareholderÂ’s receipt of an Indemnification Notice from such Parent Indemnitee, enforce its right to indemnification for such Losses. The Indemnification Notice shall set forth the basis of the claim to be made under the June Stock Purchase Agreement, together with all relevant details in the possession of Parent or Target, and shall instruct Shareholder to enforce its right to indemnification under the June Stock Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt of such Indemnification Notice, Shareholder shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, make a claim for indemnity under the June Stock Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and in connection with such claim shall only take such actions and incur such fees as reasonably requested by Parent. In connection with enforcing such rights, Parent shall, and shall cause Target to, cooperate with Shareholder and its counsel and provide Shareholder with access to all 

   ##### 

    

 

information and personnel in its possession relevant or reasonably necessary
for enforcing such rights. All amounts recovered pursuant to such
indemnification right (net of any Taxes and any actual out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of Shareholder in connection with Shareholder seeking such
Indemnification Proceeds) (the "Indemnification Proceeds") which exceed the
Cap set forth in Section 11.4.2 (the "Indemnification Excess") shall increase
the Cap in order to provide the Parent Indemnitee the full benefit of such
Indemnification Proceeds. Parent shall indemnify Shareholder for any Losses
of Shareholder arising out of the exercise of such indemnification rights
under the June Stock Purchase Agreement (including the actual out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with Shareholder seeking such
Indemnification Proceeds). Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Shareholder shall pay all such Indemnification
Proceeds to the Parent Indemnitee promptly after receipt thereof in accordance
with Section 11.6 herein, _provided_ , _however_ , that Shareholder shall pay
any Indemnification Excess to the Parent Indemnitee promptly after receipt
thereof in cash. For purposes of clarification, in no circumstance shall
Section 11.4.1 (Basket) or Section 11.4.2 (Cap) be applicable to any
Indemnification Proceeds received by Shareholder. 

   

 (b) Effective as of the Closing, Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not, by its own voluntary action, liquidate, dissolve or otherwise cease to exist so long as its indemnification rights under the June Stock Purchase Agreement are enforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , that any involuntary action of liquidation, dissolution or cessation of existence of Shareholder is not a result of the actions or inactions of Shareholder or Nordic; _provided_ _further_  that nothing in this Section 6.16(b) shall prohibit Shareholder from issuing dividends or making distributions, including from proceeds received from the sale of any Parent Shares, or otherwise writing down its share capital or buying back shares. 

  

 (c) Effective as of the Closing, Nordic hereby agrees to cause Shareholder to comply with the covenants provided for in this Section 6.16 and shall indemnify Parent for any Losses associated with ShareholderÂ’s failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the terms and conditions of this Section 6.16, in each case until the earlier of (i) when Shareholder no longer has any right to indemnification under the June Stock Purchase Agreement or (ii) six (6) years after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NordicÂ’s obligation to indemnify Parent for any such Losses shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the value (measured at the Closing) of its pro rata interest (determined based upon NordicÂ’s shareholdings in Shareholder) in the Purchase Price payable to Shareholder at Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each of Nordic Capital VI Alpha, L.P. and Nordic Capital Beta, L.P., acting through their general partner, Nordic Capital VI Limited, NC VI Limited and Nordic Industries Limited shall be only severally, and not jointly liable, for any indemnification or other obligations pursuant to this Section 6.16(c) (in proportion to their respective holdings in Shareholder). 

  

 6.17 Form 8-K Obligations. Shareholder will use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions to assist Parent in connection with ParentÂ’s preparation of the financial statements and other information it will be required to file with the SEC under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X (on Form 8-K).

For the purposes of this Section 10.2.3, Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal herein, except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%. 

   

 10.2.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1.3, 10.1.4, 10.1.5, 10.1.6, or 10.1.7 (as applicable), the payment of any Break-Up Fee shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which such party would otherwise be entitled to assert against any other partiesÂ’ respective assets, or against any of their respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers or members, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be construed as a penalty and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to such party. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1.3, 10.1.4, 10.1.5, 10.1.6, or 10.1.7 (as applicable), the rights to payment under Section 10.2.2: (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1.3, 10.1.4, 10.1.5, 10.1.6 or 10.1.7 (as applicable), and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing. 

   ##### 

  

   

 10.2.5. Any payment made pursuant to Section 10.2.2 or 10.2.3 (other than in the event a Break-Up Fee becomes due pursuant to Section 10.2.3, in which case payment shall be made no later than the two (2) Business Days after the execution by Parent of the definitive agreement in connection with the Acquisition Proposal) shall be made not later than two (2) Business Days after the date of termination. All payments under this Section 10.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent or Target, as the case may be. Parent and Target acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Target would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent or Target fail promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 10.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Target commence a suit which results in a Judgment against the other party or parties for the fees set forth in this Section 10.2, the party or parties failing to make payment shall pay to the other party or parties their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the payment to be made at the prime rate in effect on the date such payment is required to be made as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , as liquidated damages. 

  

SECTION 11. Indemnification 

   

 11.1 Shareholder. Shareholder hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Parent, and its successors and assigns, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives ("Parent Indemnitees"), from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, debts, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, costs and expenses including reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and court costs (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, any of the following: 

   

 11.1.1. Misrepresentation. Any misrepresentation of a fact contained in any representation or warranty made by Shareholder in this Agreement; 

   

 11.1.2. Nonperformance. The breach by Shareholder of any covenant or agreement of Shareholder in this Agreement; or 

   

 11.1.3. Scheduled Claims. Any matter or item set forth on Schedule 4.22. 

  

 11.2 Indemnification Procedures. With respect to each event, occurrence or matter (an "Indemnification Matter") as to which a Parent Indemnitee, as the case may be, is seeking indemnification hereunder to which the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification from Shareholder under Section 11.1: 

   

 11.2.1. Within ten (10) days after the Parent Indemnitee receives written documents underlying the Indemnification Matter or, if the Indemnification Matter does not involve a third party action, suit, claim or demand, promptly after the Parent Indemnitee first has actual knowledge of the Indemnification Matter, the Parent Indemnitee shall give written notice to Shareholder of the nature of the Indemnification 

   ##### 

  

   

Matter and the amount demanded or claimed in connection therewith
("Indemnification Notice"), together with copies of any such written
documents. 

   

 11.2.2. If a third party action, suit, claim or demand is involved, then, upon receipt of the Indemnification Notice, Shareholder shall, at its expense and through counsel of its choice, promptly assume and have sole control over the litigation, defense or settlement (the "Defense") of the Indemnification Matter, except that (i) the Parent Indemnitee may, at its option and expense and through counsel of its choice, participate in (but not control) the Defense; (ii) Shareholder shall not consent to any Judgment, or agree to any settlement, without the Parent IndemniteeÂ’s prior written consent unless such Judgment or settlement includes a complete release of the Parent Indemnitee; and (iii) if Shareholder does not promptly assume control over the Defense or, after doing so, does not continue to prosecute the Defense in good faith, the Parent Indemnitee may, at its option and through counsel of its choice, but with respect to one firm of counsel reasonably approved by Shareholder at ShareholderÂ’s expense, assume control over the Defense. In any event, Shareholder and the Parent Indemnitee shall fully cooperate with each other in connection with the Defense, including by furnishing all available documentary or other evidence as is reasonably requested by the other. 

   

 11.2.3. All amounts owed by Shareholder to the Parent Indemnitee (if any) shall be paid in full within five (5) Business Days after a final Judgment (without further right of appeal) determining the amount owed is rendered, or after a final settlement or agreement as to the amount owed is executed. 

  

 11.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that representations and warranties made by or on behalf of Target or Shareholder in this Agreement or in any document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12) months (the "Survival Period"), at which point they shall terminate and no claim for indemnification thereafter shall be brought in respect of them, except that a representation or warranty with respect to Section 4.1 (Authority), Section 4.3 (Ownership) and Section 4.11 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing Date for the maximum duration of the statute of limitations applicable with respect to such respective representation or warranty; provided, however, that from and after the third anniversary of the Closing, the Parent IndemniteesÂ’ sole recourse against Shareholder with respect to Section 4.11 (Taxes) shall be for Indemnification Proceeds recovered by Shareholder under the June Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 6.16. The covenants set forth in this Agreement or any agreements executed pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing until such covenants have been performed or waived by the party seeking enforcement thereof. 

  

 11.4 Limits on Indemnification. ShareholderÂ’s liability under this Section 11 shall be limited as follows: 

   

 11.4.1. Basket. Shareholder shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 11 unless the amount of each claim involves Losses in excess of $50,000 (nor shall such claim below $50,000 be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the deductible set forth in the next sentence). No amount shall be payable by Shareholder under this Section 11 unless and until the 

   ##### 

     

 

 aggregate amount otherwise payable by Shareholder under this Section 11 exceeds $4,000,000. At such time as the total amount payable by Shareholder exceeds $4,000,000 in the aggregate, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified only for the amount of all damages that have been incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnitees for which they are entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement that exceed $4,000,000. 

    

 11.4.2. Cap. Subject to Section 6.16, ShareholderÂ’s total liability under this Section 11 shall not exceed the fair market value of the Escrow Shares remaining in the Escrow Account at the applicable time. 

   

 11.4.3. Time Periods. With respect to any Indemnification Matter under Section 11, Shareholder shall have no liability unless the Parent Indemnitee gives an Indemnification Notice with respect thereto within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, provided that for all Losses for which an Indemnification Notice has been given prior to such date, the right to indemnification for any such Indemnification Matter shall survive until such claim for Losses has been resolved pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 11.5 Exceptions to Limitations. None of the limitations set forth in Section 11.4 shall apply in the case of any Indemnification Matter involving (a) fraud, (b) Indemnification Proceeds under Section 6.16 or (c) Losses incurred due to a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1 (Authority), Section 4.3 (Ownership), and Section 4.25 (Brokers Fees). 

  

 11.5.1. Additional Limitations on Losses. 

   

 11.4.4.1. Any claim for indemnification under this Section 11 shall be limited to the amount of actual Losses sustained by the Parent Indemnitee by reason of such breach or nonperformance. Shareholder shall not have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple, whether based on statute, contract, tort or otherwise. 

   

 11.4.4.2. Any indemnification claim under this Section 11 asserted by any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any matter for which a reserve is included in the Latest Balance Sheet shall be reduced by the amount of such reserve. 

   

 11.4.4.3. For all purposes of this Section 11, Losses shall be net of (i) any insurance, indemnification or other recoveries payable to the Parent Indemnitee or its affiliates under any insurance policy or any other Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and (ii) any Tax benefit available to the Parent Indemnitee or its affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses. If Shareholder makes any payment on any claim, Shareholder shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Parent 

   ##### 

   

   

Indemnitee to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Parent Indemnitee
with respect to such claim. 

   

 11.4.4.4 The Parent Indemnitee shall cooperate with Shareholder with respect to resolving any claims or liabilities with respect to which Shareholder is obligated to indemnify such Parent Indemnitee, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claims or liabilities. 

  

 11.6 Satisfaction of Shareholder Losses. Subject to Section 6.16, in the event that Shareholder is required to indemnify any Parent Indemnitee for any Losses under this Section 11, Shareholder shall have the option to elect to satisfy such Losses either (i) in cash or (ii) by the return of Escrow Shares. The number of the Escrow Shares to be returned to satisfy any such Losses shall be calculated as the quotient of (A) the dollar amount of such Losses divided by (B) the average closing sales price per share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the date such Losses become due and payable hereto as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market. Any amounts recovered by Parent under the June Stock Purchase Agreement, paid to Parent by Shareholder pursuant to Section 6.16 or otherwise paid in cash to Parent pursuant to this Section 11.6 shall entitle Shareholder to the distribution of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Agreement (to the extent any Escrow Shares continue to be held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) with a value equal to such cash recovery or payment based on the average closing sales price per share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the date of such recovery by Parent or payment by Shareholder to Parent as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market. 

  

 11.7 Tax Treatment. The parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes, as between Parent and Shareholder, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or Taxing Authority interpretations thereof. 

  

 11.8 Remedies Exclusive. The remedies provided for in this Section 11 and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be exclusive and shall preclude assertion by any Parent Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against Shareholder for claims based on this Agreement or any other agreement, document or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Parent hereby waives any provision of Law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this Section 11.7. 

  

SECTION 12. Other Provisions 

   

 12.1 Fees and Expenses. All fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel, and accountants shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such fees, costs and expenses of Shareholder shall be paid by Target. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the payment of any consulting, investment banking or financial advisory fees of Shareholder or Target shall be borne by Shareholder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.2 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time before or after any approval hereof by holders of Parent Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining such approval. 

  

 12.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be enforced. Except as so waived, no action taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any party, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties, shall constitute a waiver of, or shall preclude any other or further exercise of, any right, power or remedy. 

  

 12.4 Publicity. At all times after the Closing Date, except as required by Law, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Shareholder shall not make any public announcement regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall Shareholder in any manner disseminate any information regarding Target, Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
