1.3 _ Certain Interpretations_.

  



  

(a) _ References to this Agreement_. Unless otherwise indicated, when a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule, Annex or
Exhibit, that reference is to an Article, Section, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit
to this Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

(b) _ Hereof, Including, etc_. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words
"hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import will, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (ii) the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" will be deemed in each case to be followed by the
words "without limitation."

  



  

(c) _ Neither, etc_. Unless the context otherwise requires, "neither,"
"nor," "any," "either" and "or" are not exclusive.

  



  

(d) _ Extent_. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean
"if."

  



  

(e) _ Dollars_. When used in this Agreement, references to "$" or
"Dollars" are references to U.S. dollars.

  



  

(f) _ NIS_. When used in this Agreement, references to "NIS" are
references to Israeli New Shekels.

  



  

(g) _ Gender and Number_. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term
defined and used in this Agreement is equally applicable to both the singular
and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender include all
genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its
other grammatical forms has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this
Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined
in such certificate or document.

  



  

(h) _ References to Parties_. When reference is made to any Party to this
Agreement or any other agreement or document, such reference includes that
Party's successors and permitted assigns. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person.

  



  

(i) _ References to Subsidiaries_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
all references in this Agreement to the Subsidiaries of a Person will be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person.

  



  

(j) _ Legislation_. A reference to any specific legislation or to any
provision of any legislation includes any amendment to, and any modification,
re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted
therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued
thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes of any
representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific
date, references to any specific legislation will be deemed to refer to such
legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments
issued thereunder or pursuant thereto) as of such date. References to any
agreement or Contract are to that agreement or Contract as amended, modified
or supplemented from time to time, except that, for purposes of any
representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific
date, references to any specific Contract will be deemed to refer to such
Contract as amended, modified or supplemented as of such date.

  



  

   

  



  

(k) _ Accounting Matters_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all accounting terms used in this Agreement will be interpreted,
and all accounting determinations under this Agreement will be made, in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

  



  

(l) _ Headings_. The table of contents and headings set forth in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and will not affect
or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(m) _ Calculation of Time Periods_. Unless otherwise indicated, (i) when
calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which
any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that
is the reference date in calculating such period will be excluded; (ii) if the
last day of such period is a non-Business Day, then the period in question
will end on the next Business Day; (iii) the measure of a period of one month
or year for purposes of this Agreement will be the day of the following month
or year corresponding to the starting date; and (iv) if no corresponding date
exists, then the end date of such period being measured will be the next
actual day of the following month or year (for example, one month following
February 18 is March 18 and one month following March 31 is May 1). References
to "from" or "through" any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and
including or through and including such date, respectively.

  



  

(n) _ Joint Drafting_. The Parties agree that they have been represented
by legal counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement.
Accordingly, they waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

(o) _ Summaries_. No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit, Schedule,
Annex or other document delivered with this Agreement that is prepared by or
on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or such Exhibit, Schedule, Annex or document.

  



  

(p) _ No Admission_. The information contained in this Agreement and in
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of
any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of contract.
No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed, in and
of itself, as an admission or representation that such item or other matter is
"material" or would have a "Material Adverse Effect," is or is not in the
ordinary course of business or that such item or other matter is required to
be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

   

  



  

(q) _ No Reliance by Others on Representations_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section _ _8.5_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

(i) _ Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth in _Section _

for all Company Shares held by such Effective Time Holder. The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each Effective Time Holder shall
be computed after aggregating all Parent Common Stock issuable for all Company
Shares held by such Effective Time Holder. In lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Merger,
each Effective Time Holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger in
accordance with _Section _ _2.7(a)(i)_ will be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (A) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (B) the Parent Average Closing Price.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) _ Owned Company Shares_. Each Company Share held in the treasury of
the Company (dormant shares), together with any Company Shares reserved for
future grants under the Company Plans, or owned by the 102 Trustee on behalf
of the Company, or held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, if any, shall remain outstanding, and no Merger Consideration or any
other consideration shall be due or delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(iii) _ Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each ordinary share, par value NIS
0.10 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable ordinary share, nominal value NIS 0.14 per share, of
the Surviving Company, and such ordinary shares, together with the Company
Shares that remain outstanding in accordance with _Section _ _2.7(a)(ii)_ ,
__ shall constitute the only outstanding share capital of the Surviving
Company.

  



  

(b) _ Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding share capital of the Company shall occur (other than an increase
in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the exercise of any Company
Compensatory Award in accordance with its terms), including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, or any record date for any such purpose shall be established, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted, so as to provide to the holders of Company
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action.

  



  

(c) _ Adjustments to Stock Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the
other provisions of this Agreement, including _Section_ _5.4_ , the Stock
Merger Consideration shall automatically be adjusted to reflect appropriately
the effect of (i) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities of a Subsidiary of
Parent or of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
Parent Common Stock, or (ii) any conversion of Parent Common Stock into, or
into the right to receive, cash, securities or other property, in each case
with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

the payment agent for the Merger (the " **Paying Agent** "); (ii) enter into
and deliver to the Company an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form to be
agreed by the Company and Parent (" **Paying Agent Agreement** "); and (iii)
at the request of the Company, engage an information and paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the " **Information Agent**
") to assist in obtaining any requisite residency certificate or other
declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes and, in connection therewith,

Compensatory Awards (other than Company 102 Compensatory Awards, Company
Compensatory Awards otherwise held by the 102 Trustee, the Assumed Options,
the Assumed RSA and the Assumed RSUs), in respect of which Parent shall cause

such holders of Company Shares (including Company 102 Shares) and Company

the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Exchange Fund Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section
_ _2.7(a)_ , _Section _ _2.11_ and _Section _ _6.14_ , Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, promptly replace or restore the cash in

the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor or applicable
Uncertificated Shares are registered in the share transfer books or ledger of
the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or applicable
Uncertificated Shares are registered in the share transfer books or ledger of
the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer or if the appropriate acknowledgment
for the conversion of such Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration has been delivered and the Person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) _ No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, none of the Exchange Fund Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Company or any other Party shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned

outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore exchanged
their Certificates representing such Company Shares or delivered to the
Exchange Fund Agent the acknowledgment of the conversion of their
Uncertificated Shares for exchange for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section _ _2.8_ shall thereafter look only to Parent,
as general creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable
Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of Company Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

2.9 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, all issued and outstanding Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor
upon the surrender or acknowledgment of the conversion thereof in accordance
with the provisions of _Section _ _2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, for any reason (a) Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Company, or (b) acknowledgments are delivered to the Exchange Fund Agent of
the conversion of any Uncertificated Shares, such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, shall be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case as
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
_Article II_.

  



  

2.10 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Fund
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section _ _2.7_ ,
except that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Fund Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

   

  



  

2.11 _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Uncertificated Shares for which the
applicable acknowledgment has not been delivered to the Exchange Fund Agent
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof is
entitled to receive upon the surrender or acknowledgment of the conversion
thereof, as applicable, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section _
_2.7(a)(i)_ , in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall have
surrendered such Certificate or the holder of such Uncertificated Shares shall
have delivered such acknowledgment of the conversion of such Uncertificated
Shares, in each case in accordance with this _Article _ _II_. Following the
surrender of any Certificate or acknowledgment of the conversion of any
Uncertificated Shares, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article _ _II_ (a) at the
time of such surrender or acknowledgment, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section _ _2.7(a)(i)_ and (b) at the

acknowledgment and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or
acknowledgment payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

2.12 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Company shall take all such lawful and necessary
action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

  



  

2.13 _ Withholding Tax._

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, Parent, its
Subsidiaries, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Company, the 102
Trustee and the Exchange Fund Agent (each a " **Payor** ") shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment or consideration made pursuant to this
Agreement (including the Merger Consideration and payments made pursuant to
_Section _ _6.13_ ) such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the
Ordinance, or under any provision of applicable U.S. federal, state, local,
Israeli, or other Tax Law (it being agreed that the Payor shall be permitted
to satisfy any Tax withholding requirement with respect to the Merger
Consideration by deducting and withholding the appropriate cash amount from
the Cash Merger Consideration). With respect to withholding of Israeli Tax, in
the event any holder of record of Company Shares or Company Options provides
the Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate issued by the Israeli Tax Authority
(the " **ITA** ") regarding the withholding (or exemption from withholding) of
Israeli Tax from the consideration payable in respect thereof in accordance
with this _Article II_, or other treatment with respect to Israeli Tax, at
least five (5) Business Days prior to any payment payable pursuant to this
Agreement, then the deduction and withholding of any amounts under the
Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli Law or requirement, if any, from
the Merger Consideration, including any Merger Consideration payable with
respect to Company Compensatory Awards, as applicable, payable to such holder
of record of Company Shares or Company Compensatory Awards, as applicable,
shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax
Certificate. To the extent that amounts are so withheld pursuant to this
_Section _ _2.13_ , they shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity prior to the last day on which such payment is required to be paid to
such Governmental Entity, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section _ _2.13(a)_ above, with
respect to Israeli Taxes, the consideration payable to each Company
Shareholder shall be retained by the Exchange Fund Agent for the benefit of
each such Company Shareholder for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180)
days from Closing (the " **Withholding Drop Date** ") (during which time no
Payor shall make any payments to any Company Shareholder or withhold any
amounts for Israeli Taxes from the payments deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement, except as provided below and during which time each Company
Shareholder may obtain a Valid Tax Certificate). If a Company Shareholder
delivers, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop
Date a Valid Tax Certificate to Payor, then the deduction and withholding of
any Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
Valid Tax Certificate and the balance of the payment that is not withheld
shall be paid to such Company Shareholder concurrently therewith subject to
any non-Israeli withholding which is applicable to the payment (if any). If
any Company Shareholder (i) does not provide Payor with a Valid Tax
Certificate by no later than five (5) Business Days before the Withholding
Drop Date or (ii) submits a written request with Payor to release its portion
of the consideration prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a
Valid Tax Certificate at or before such time, then the amount to be withheld
from such Company Shareholder's portion of the consideration shall be
calculated according to the applicable withholding rate as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion in accordance with Applicable Law (increased by
interest plus linkage differences, as defined in Section 159A(a) of the
Ordinance, for the period between the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar
month following the month during which the Closing occurs and the time that
the relevant payment is made, and calculated in NIS based on a US$:NIS
exchange rate not lower than the effective exchange rate at the Closing Date
as determined by Parent and the Exchange Fund Agent).

  



  

(c) With respect to non-Israeli resident holders of Company Compensatory
Awards or Company Shares who are or were engaged by any non-Israeli Subsidiary
of the Company and were granted such securities as awards in consideration
solely for work or services performed outside of Israel, if such holders
provide a validly executed declaration in a form previously agreed by Parent
and the Company regarding their non-Israeli residence and confirmation that
they were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services
performed outside of Israel, such payments shall not be subject to any
withholding or deduction of Israeli Tax and shall be made through the relevant
Subsidiary's payroll processing service or system.

any event within three Business Days following the date of this Agreement)
request in writing that each Third Party that has previously executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company in the one year period prior to the date of this Agreement return
or destroy all confidential information previously furnished to such Third
Party by or on behalf of the Company.

  



  

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall not (and it shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission or announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal or the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) in connection with or in response to any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to

Subsidiaries to any Third Party, or take any other action intended to assist
or facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
(for the avoidance of doubt, neither (A) the announcement of the execution of
this Agreement nor (B) the provision of information to Third Parties pursuant
to communications in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice that are unrelated to any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such
communications are covered by any contractual or other arrangements), shall in

of its Subsidiaries and any Third Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may,
directly or indirectly through any Representative, subject to the Company's
compliance with the provisions of this _Section _ _6.1_ , with respect to any
Third Party that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from
a material breach of this _Section _ _6.1_ (but only if the Company Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal) (A) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party or (B) furnish to such Third
Party any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of which,
except with respect to any "standstill" or similar provision, are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any explicit or
implicit standstill provision) and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this _Section _
_6.1_. The Company Board may take the actions contemplated by clauses (A) and
(B) of the prior sentence only if (1) at least 24 hours prior to engaging or
participating in any such discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing any
non-public information to, such Third Party, the Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and all of the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal (and if such Acquisition Proposal is in written

furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent that such
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company acknowledge and agree that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section _ _6.1_ by any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach of this _Section _ _6.1_ by the Company. The Company shall not enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract (other than
a confidentiality agreement as permitted by _Section _ _6.1(b)_ )
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless and
until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, and the
Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section _ _8.3_ , if any.

  



  

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section _
_6.1(b)_ , the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within 36 hours of its
receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of any (i) Acquisition Proposal;

Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) inquiry with respect to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
discussions relating to, and material terms and conditions (including all
amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms and conditions) of
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and promptly (and in no
event later than 36 hours thereafter) upon receipt or delivery of any of the
following provide Parent with copies of all documents and written (including
electronic) communications relating to any Acquisition Proposal (including the
financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged between the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (or such
Person's Affiliates or Representatives), on the other hand. In addition to the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least 72 hours (or such
shorter period of notice as is given to each of the members of the Company
Board or committee thereof, as applicable) prior written notice of a meeting
of the Company Board (or any committee thereof) at which the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition

request to provide non-public information to any Person.

shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section _ _6.2_ , the Company Board
shall not make a Company Board Recommendation Change.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may in response to its receipt of a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of _Section _ _6.1_ , (i)
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section _ _8.1(g)_ to, substantially concurrently with such
termination, enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such
Acquisition Proposal if, and only if (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in
good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause
(iv) below), that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (y) in light of such Superior Proposal, failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under Israeli Law; (B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least four Business Days'
notice (the " **Superior Proposal Notice Period** ") of such determination
(which notice shall include the most current version of the proposed
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and, to the extent
not included therein, all material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (which proposed agreement or material terms shall be updated on a
prompt basis) and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal),
(C) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its
discretion, proposes to make such modifications; (D) after taking into account
any counter-offer or proposal Parent shall have made, if any, within the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board again makes the
determination set forth in clause (A) of this _Section _ _6.2(c)_ (it being
understood that (1) any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal,
including any revision in price, shall require a new notice pursuant to clause
(B) above; (2) the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if
applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that no less than two Business
Days remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time that
the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision; and (3) there may
be multiple extensions of the Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of
succeeding material revisions to the terms of any Superior Proposal); and (E)
in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of
this _Section _ _6.2(c)_ , the Company concurrently pays all amounts due to
Parent pursuant to and in accordance with _Section _ _8.3_. The Company shall
ensure that any Company Board Recommendation Change (including one effected in
respect of a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event) does not: (x) change or
otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board; or (y)
have the effect of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may in response to an Intervening Event effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if, and only if (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in
good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause
(iii) below), that, in light of such Intervening Event, failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under Israeli Law; (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least four Business Days'
notice (the " **Intervening Event Notice Period** ") thereof (which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the reasons for
such proposed Company Board Recommendation Change) and the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Intervening Event
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to
make such modifications; and (iii) after taking into account any counter-offer
or proposal Parent shall have made, if any, within the Intervening Event
Notice Period, the Company Board again makes the determination set forth in
clause (i) of this _Section_ _6.2(d)_.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board from (i) taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) taking and disclosing to
the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Section 329 of the
ICL or (iii) making any other disclosure to its shareholders if the Company
Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary or other duties of the members of the
Company Board under Israeli Law or as otherwise may be required pursuant to
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any statements made by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act or other Applicable Law shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and (B) it is acknowledged and agreed that
any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to
be a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication).

  



  

   

  



  

(f) Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_, the Company shall not take any action to approve any transaction under,
or exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates) from the provisions of, any Takeover Law or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply. To the extent permitted under any Takeover Law, the
Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver or
other exemption that may have been previously granted to any such Person or
any Acquisition Proposal under any such provision.

Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall

categories of assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (B) the imposition of any license or condition or the
commitment to take any action (or to refrain from taking any action) that
limits in any manner its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
operate, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B), to the
extent such license, condition or commitment does not materially (with
materiality determined relative to the size of the business and operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and not relative to those of Parent and its
Subsidiaries) impact in an adverse manner (x) Parent's and its Subsidiaries'
(including the Surviving Company's) business or operations, taken as a whole,
or (y) the benefits to be derived by Parent and its Subsidiaries from the

Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any business,
person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to such
acquisition or the consummation of such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the failure to obtain or materially impair or delay
the obtaining of the expiration or termination of the waiting period in
respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Applicable Law, (ii) the entry, the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry, or failure to effect the dissolution, in each

Representatives with access to or to disclose (i) information that is subject
to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a Third Party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement (provided, however, that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate redactions to any
information subject to such a confidentiality agreement to disclose the
maximum extent of such information that does not result in a violation of such
obligation of confidentiality), (ii) information the disclosure of which would
violate any Applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall

version does not include material non-public information about the Company and
its Subsidiaries or their securities;

  



  

   

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument executed
and delivered pursuant to this _Section_ _6.11_ (other than authorization
letters, management representation letters or other documents delivered to the
Company's independent registered accounting firm in connection with the
Specified Auditor Assistance, in each case, referred to above) shall be
effective prior to the Closing.

  



  

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and each of its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not
reasonably expected to, harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their
respective marks, products, services, offerings or Intellectual Property
Rights. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) incurred by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in connection with providing
the assistance contemplated by this _Section_ _6.11_. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including attorney's fees), awards, judgments, penalties and other
Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than any
information provided in writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
expressly for use in connection therewith) or in connection with providing the
assistance contemplated by this _Section_ _6.11_ , except to the extent
arising from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_
_6.11_ , (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives shall be required to take or permit the taking of
any action or provide any assistance that would (A) unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
proximately cause any representation or warranty or covenant of the Company in
this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates
to pay (or agree to pay) any fees, or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed, or otherwise incur any other
obligations (other than any obligations under customary authorization letters,
management representation letters or other documents delivered to the
Company's independent registered accounting firm in connection with the
Specified Auditor Assistance) or give any indemnities prior to the Closing
that are not contingent on the Closing, (D) cause any director, officer,
employee or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal Liability, (E) conflict with the organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Applicable Laws, (F) result in the
breach of, or default under, any Material Contract or (G) require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare separate financial statements for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or change any fiscal period or prepare any
financial statements or information that are not available to it and prepared
in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice; and (ii) none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers shall be obligated to adopt resolutions or execute consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit the adoption or execution
of any resolutions or consents effective no earlier than the Closing Date
(after giving effect to the Closing) by any Person that will remain or will
become an officer or director of the Surviving Company as of the Effective
Time. Nothing in this _Section_ _6.11_ shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to disclose any information
to Parent, Parent's Representatives or the Financing Sources if such
disclosure would (x) violate any Applicable Law or Contract or (y) jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not provide or cause its Representatives to provide such
access or such information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence,
then the Company shall (1) promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) provide a written notice to Parent stating that it is withholding such
access or such information and stating the justification therefor and (2) use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the applicable access or
information in a way that would not violate such Applicable Law or Contract or
jeopardize such privilege.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses subject to reimbursement pursuant to _Section_
_6.11(c)_ , none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives shall have any responsibility for, or incur any
Liability to, any Person under any Debt Financing that Parent may obtain in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
cooperation provided pursuant to this _Section_ _6.11_.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or anything to
the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent or any of its
Affiliates may disclose Evaluation Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Financing Sources (in each case, without any obligation on the part of the
Financing Sources to comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement)
so long as the Financing Sources are subject to confidentiality undertakings
under a binding written confidentiality commitment to Parent that are at least
as restrictive as those applicable to the Parent with respect to the Company
(except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any explicit or
implicit standstill provision)).

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but without
limiting the obligations of the Company hereunder, including this _Section _
_6.11_ , Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that their obligations to
consummate the Merger and the other transaction contemplated by this Agreement

Debt Financing or otherwise.

6.13 _ Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company have agreed upon the

and will issue such press release promptly following the execution of this
Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or

6.14 _ Company Compensatory Awards_.

  



  

 _(a) Company_ _Restricted Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each
award of Company Restricted Share Units (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not
vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
shall be assumed by Parent (each, an " **Assumed RSU** ") and Parent and the
Company shall take such acts and adopt such corporate resolutions as may be
required to effect such assumption. The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be equal to the product of (i) the
number of Company Shares underlying such unvested Company Restricted Share
Unit award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming, in the
case of an Assumed RSU that is subject to performance-based vesting
conditions, that applicable performance goals have been attained at maximum
levels) multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number,
rounded to the nearest whole share). Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent
and a holder of such Assumed RSUs or as otherwise provided in _Section _
_6.14(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, such Assumed RSUs will be subject
to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related award
of Company Restricted Share Units immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the same service-based vesting schedule (but not the same or any
other performance-based vesting conditions) applicable thereto, and the same
right to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends in respect thereof
(including any such dividends that are accrued but unpaid as of the Effective
Time). Any Company Restricted Share Unit (or portion thereof) that is not an
Assumed RSU (each, a " **Cancelled RSU** ") shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive, without
interest, with respect to each Company Share underlying such Cancelled RSU
(assuming, in the case of a Cancelled RSU that is subject to performance-based
vesting conditions, that applicable performance goals have been attained at
maximum levels), the Merger Consideration and any accrued but unpaid dividends
with respect to such Cancelled RSU (together, the " **Cancelled RSU Amount**
"). Except as otherwise required under Section 409A, the holder of each
Cancelled RSU that is not a Company 102 Restricted Share Unit shall, with
respect to each Company Share underlying such Cancelled RSU, receive at the
Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in
no event later than the Company's first full payroll after the Effective Time)
from the Surviving Company, an amount equal to the Cancelled RSU Amount. The
payment of the Cancelled RSU Amount to the holder of a Cancelled RSU shall be
reduced by any applicable tax withholding required under the Code or any
Applicable Law. The applicable taxes required to be withheld from the
Cancelled RSU Amount payable to the holder of a Cancelled RSU shall reduce
first the Cash Merger Consideration portion of such Merger Consideration and
any accrued but unpaid dividends payable in respect of the Cancelled RSU as of
the Effective Time, with any remaining amount reducing the Stock Merger
Consideration portion of such Merger Consideration, with the value of the
stock portion for purposes of such deduction determined based on the Parent
Average Closing Price. The holder of each Cancelled RSU that is a Company 102
Restricted Share Unit or that is otherwise held by the 102 Trustee shall
receive the Cancelled RSU Amount through the 102 Trustee in accordance with
_Section _ _2.8_.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _ Company_ _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each award of
Company Restricted Shares (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) shall be
assumed by Parent (each, an " **Assumed RSA** ") and Parent and the Company
shall take such acts and adopt such corporate resolutions as may be required
to effect such assumption. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to each Assumed RSA shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of
unvested Company Restricted Shares underlying such RSA as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting number, rounded to the nearest whole share). Except as otherwise
agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed RSAs or as otherwise provided
in _Section _ _6.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, such Assumed RSAs
will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to
the related award of Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule applicable thereto, and
the same right to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends in respect thereof
(including any such dividends that are accrued but unpaid as of the Effective
Time). Any award of Company Restricted Shares that is not an Assumed RSA
shall, with respect to each such Company Restricted Share, be treated as a
Company Share that shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any accrued
but unpaid dividends in respect of such Company Restricted Share as of the
Effective Time (together, the " **Company Restricted Share Amount** "). The
holder of each such Company Restricted Share shall receive at the Effective
Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event
later than the Company's first full payroll after the Effective Time) from the
Surviving Company, an amount equal to the Company Restricted Share Amount. The
payment of the Company Restricted Share Amount to the holder of a Company
Share shall be reduced by any applicable tax withholding required under the
Code or any Applicable Law. The applicable taxes required to be withheld from
the Company Restricted Share Amount payable to the holder of such Company
Restricted Share shall reduce first the Cash Merger Consideration portion of
such Company Restricted Share Amount and any accrued but unpaid dividends
payable in respect of such Company Restricted Share as of the Effective Time,
with any remaining amount reducing the Stock Merger Consideration portion of
such Company Restricted Share Amount, with the value of the stock portion for
purposes of such deduction determined based on the Parent Average Closing
Price. The holder of each Company 102 Restricted Share or Company Restricted
Share that is otherwise held by the 102 Trustee that is not an Assumed RSA
shall receive the Company Restricted Share Amount through the 102 Trustee in
accordance with _Section_ _2.8_.

  



  

(c) _ Company_ _Options_.

  



  

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or
vests as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(each, a " **Cancelled Option** ") shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Net Share covered by such Cancelled Option;
except that, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, any fractional Net Share
(after aggregating all shares represented by all Cancelled Options held by
such individual) shall be settled in cash based on the Cash Equivalent
Consideration (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the "
**Option Consideration** "). The holder of each Cancelled Option shall receive
at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter
(but in no even later than the Company's first full payroll after the
Effective Time) from the Surviving Company, the Option Consideration. If the
exercise price per share of any such Cancelled Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall, by direction of
Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled
without any payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of Option
Consideration to the holder of a Cancelled Option shall be reduced by any
applicable tax withholding required under the Code or any Applicable Law. The
applicable taxes required to be withheld from the Option Consideration shall
reduce first the Cash Merger Consideration portion of the Option Consideration
with any remaining amount reducing the Stock Merger Consideration portion of
the Option Consideration, with the value of the stock portion for purposes of
such deduction determined based on the Parent Average Closing Price. The
holder of each Cancelled Option that is a Company 102 Option or that is
otherwise held by the 102 Trustee shall receive the Option Consideration
through the 102 Trustee in accordance with _Section_ _2.8_.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be assumed by Parent (each, an " **Assumed Option** ") and
Parent and the Company shall take such acts and adopt such corporate
resolutions as may be required to effect such assumption. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section _ _6.14(c)(ii)_ or in _Section _ _6.14(c)(ii)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, each such Assumed Option shall be subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same service-
based vesting schedule (but not the same or any other performance-based
vesting conditions) applicable thereto, except that (A) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be equal to the
product of (x) the number of Company Shares underlying such unvested Assumed
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming, in the case of
an Assumed Option that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions,
that applicable performance goals have been attained at maximum levels)
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down
to the nearest whole share); and (B) the per share exercise price of each
Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the
exercise price per share at which such Assumed Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each Assumed
Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an
incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Option
qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and,
further, that the assumption of Assumed Options pursuant to this Section shall
be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and
this _Section _ _6.14(c)_ will be construed consistent with this intent.

  



  

(d) _ Termination_ _of Non-U.S. Company Compensatory Awards_.
Notwithstanding the provisions above, Parent may, prior to the Effective Time,
determine reasonably and in good faith, subject to the consent of the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld that any Company Compensatory Award
that is subject to the Applicable Laws of a non-U.S. or non-Israeli
jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other than prescribed by _Section _
_6.14(a)_ through _Section_ _6.14(c)_ , as applicable, to the extent that (i)
Parent and the Company reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the
manner in which such Company Compensatory Award would otherwise be treated
pursuant to _Section _ _6.14(a)_ through _6.14(c)_ , as applicable, would
result in a violation of Applicable Laws or a materially adverse tax
consequence to the individual holding such Company Compensatory Award in the
applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment is necessary
to comply with such Applicable Laws; and (ii) such different treatment is, to
the maximum extent practicable, consistent with _Section _ _6.14(a)_ through
_6.14(c)_ , as applicable. Parent and the Company shall agree at least ten
(10) days prior to the Effective Time to the treatment of any Company
Compensatory Award that will be treated in a manner other than prescribed by
_Section _ _6.14(a)_ through _6.14(c)_ , as applicable.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) _ Necessary_ _Actions; Form S-8_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
_ _6.14_ under all Company Plans and Company Compensatory Awards or any other
plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices,
obtaining all necessary consents, and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Promptly after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days following
the Effective Time), if available for use by Parent, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form) relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to,
or underlying, Assumed RSUs, Assumed RSAs and Assumed Options under this
_Section _ _6.14_.

  



  

6.15 _ Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of shares of Parent
Common Stock by each individual who is or shall become a director or officer
of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent, or the assumption by Parent of Assumed
RSUs, Assumed RSAs or Assumed Options held by such individuals, in each case
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.16 _ Operations in Israel; Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent currently intends, with respect to the Surviving Company, (i)
to continue Parent's existing policies of investment and expansion in the
State of Israel and (ii) in furtherance of the foregoing, has no present
intention to, after the Closing, move the headquarters of the Surviving
Company, or the operations of the Surviving Company conducted at such
headquarters, outside the State of Israel.

  



  

(b) Following the Effective Time and until the first anniversary thereof
(the " **Benefits Continuation Period** "), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each Continuing Employee (i) annual
base compensation, short-term incentive opportunities and long-term incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable, in each case, than the annual base
compensation, short-term incentive opportunities and long-term incentive
opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section _ _6.16(a)_ , from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to comply with all obligations under the Employee Plans,
including all of the Company's employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, programs, policies and arrangements, in each case, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(d) With respect to all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company
or their respective Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, each Continuing
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section _ _6.16(a)_ , Parent
shall cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to
the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any Employee Plan, for purposes of any Employee Plan
containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control," the
Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" (except as would result in the imposition of "additional taxes" under
Section 409A).

  



  

(g) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately
preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group
of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent, any and
all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall
not be terminated. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k)
plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to the review and approval of Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

   

  



  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to continue any specific
benefit plan or program, or to continue the employment of any specific person.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any
compensation or benefits on the part of any Continuing Employee or other
future, present or former employee of Parent, the Company or their respective
Affiliates. _Section _ _6.14_ and _Section_ _6.16_ are intended to be for the
sole benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in _Section _
_6.14_ and _Section_ _6.16_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or make any
employee or other service provider of the Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Person a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
No provision of this Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any Employee
Plan. Further, Parent, the Company and their respective Affiliates retain the
right to amend or terminate their benefit plans at any time and from time to
time (in each case, in accordance with the terms of the applicable benefit
plan).

  



  

6.17 _ Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their respective
articles of association (and other similar organizational documents) and all
indemnification and exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers (the " **Indemnified Parties** ") in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or which may be entered into subsequent to the date of this
Agreement as permitted by _Section_ _5.2(g)_. From and after the Effective
Time, in the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(ii) transfers or conveys all of or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any Person, (iii) transfers any material portion of its assets
in a single transaction or in a series of transactions or (iv) Parent takes
any action to materially impair the financial ability of the Surviving Company
and its applicable Subsidiaries to satisfy the obligations referred to in this
_Section_ _6.17_ , then, and in each such case, Parent shall either (A)
guarantee, expressly assume, or shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall expressly
assume, the obligations set forth in this _Section_ _6.17_ ; or (B) take any
other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving Company to satisfy
such obligations will not be diminished in any material respect. For seven
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to) cause the articles of association,
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or any other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the articles
of association of the Company immediately prior to the date of this Agreement,
and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who were covered by such provisions, except as required by Applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) For a period of seven years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance (" **D andO Insurance**") in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, any
ancillary documents, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby and the consummation thereof), covering each person covered by the
DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " **Insured
Parties** "), on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less
favorable, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Company may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and
amounts no less favorable, to such persons than the DandO Insurance. In
satisfying its obligations under this _Section _ _6.17(b)_ , Parent and the
Surviving Company shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of
250% of the annual amount payable by the Company for the DandO Insurance (such
amount, the " **Annual Premium** ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in _Section _ _6.17(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter), it being understood that if the annual premiums of the DandO Insurance
exceed 250% of the Annual Premium, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding 250% of the Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a seven-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " **Tail Policy**
") on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable than the DandO
Insurance and for an amount not to exceed 300% of the Annual Premium. In the
event that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase
a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable,
than the DandO Insurance. In the event that either the Company or Parent shall
purchase such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under the first sentence
of this _Section _ _6.17(b)_ , for so long as such Tail Policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

  



  

(c) The obligations set forth in this _Section _ _6.17_ shall survive
consummation of the Merger. Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section _ _6.17_ , with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto.

  



  

(d) In the event that any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (" **Claim** " **)** is brought or asserted
against any Indemnified Party or Insured Party with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as such
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement, any ancillary documents, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the consummation thereof), then the
Surviving Company shall afford, and shall cause each of its applicable
Subsidiaries to afford, the Indemnified Party and Insured Party and its
counsel and other representatives, reasonable access, during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to information and documents relating to such
Claim and the defense thereof, subject to such Indemnified Party or Insured
Party signing a confidentiality undertaking in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent with respect to confidential information and documents
being so disclosed. The Surviving Company shall, and shall cause each of its
applicable Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party
and the Insured Party in connection with the defense of such Claim, provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Claim involves matters
where the Indemnified Party or the Insured Party is adverse to the Parent or
the Surviving Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof, such cooperation
shall not include the provision of any privileged communications or other such
information.

  



  

   

  



  

6.18 _ Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to prepare and
file with the ITA an application for a ruling confirming that (i) the
cancellation and exchange of the Company 102 Compensatory Awards in accordance
with _Section _ _6.14_ and conversion of the Company 102 Shares in accordance
_Section _ _2.7(a)_ and _Section_ _2.8_ shall not be regarded as a violation
of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in Section 102 of
the Ordinance) so long as the respective consideration to be received in
respect of such Company 102 Compensatory Awards and Company 102 Shares in
accordance with this Agreement is deposited with the 102 Trustee until the end
of the respective holding period (which ruling may be subject to customary
conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) and (ii) all Assumed RSUs,
Assumed RSAs and Assumed Options that were Company 102 Options, Company 102
Restricted Shares or Company 102 Restricted Share Units prior to the Effective
Time shall continue, after the Effective Time, to benefit from the provisions
of Section 102 of the Ordinance and to qualify thereunder as grants made
through a trustee pursuant to the capital gains tax route (the " **Option Tax
Ruling** "). The Company shall include in the request for the Option Tax
Ruling a request to exempt Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Fund
Agent and their respective agents from any withholding obligation in relation
to any payments made with respect to any Company 102 Compensatory Awards or
Company 102 Shares. If the Option Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the
Closing or in accordance with the instructions of the ITA, the Company shall
seek to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among
other things, that Parent and any Person acting on its behalf (including the
Exchange Fund Agent) shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation
to any payments made with respect to any Company 102 Compensatory Awards or
Company 102 Shares to the Exchange Fund Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Company
in connection with the Merger (the " **Interim Option Tax Ruling** "). To the
extent that prior to the Closing an Interim Option Tax Ruling shall have been
obtained, then all references herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed
to refer to such Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final
definitive Option Tax Ruling is obtained.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to
prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (i) with respect to
holders of Company Shares that are non-Israeli residents (as defined in the
Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA), (A) exempting Parent, the
Exchange Fund Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents from
any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation exists; or (B)
instructing Parent, the Exchange Fund Agent, the Surviving Company and their
respective agents on how such withholding is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates of
withholding to be applied and how to identify any such non−Israeli residents;
and (ii) with respect to holders of Company Shares that are Israeli residents
(as defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA) (other than
holders of Company Shares subject to Section 102 of the Ordinance) (A)
exempting Parent, the Exchange Fund Agent, the Surviving Company and their
respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation
exists; or (B) instructing Parent, the Exchange Fund Agent, the Surviving
Company and their respective agents on how such withholding is to be executed,
and in particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates of
withholding to be applied (the " **Withholding Tax Ruling** ").

  



  

(c) _ 104H Tax Ruling_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and
accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (or
an interim ruling) permitting holders of Company Shares that are Israeli
residents (as defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA)
(the " **Electing Holder** "), to defer any applicable Israeli tax with
respect to the Stock Merger Consideration that such Electing Holder will
receive pursuant to this Agreement until the sale, transfer or other
conveyance for cash of such stock portion of the consideration by such
Electing Holder or such other date set forth in Section 104H of the Israeli
Tax Ordinance (the " **104H Tax Ruling** ").

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section _ _6.6(a)_ , each of the
Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause
their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all
material activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the
preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any
written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Option Tax Ruling (including the Interim Option Tax Ruling), the
Withholding Tax Ruling and the 104H Tax Ruling and in obtaining such rulings.
Parent shall be given the opportunity to review the final text of the Interim

the Company shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent or its counsel.

any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, except that if this Agreement has been
approved by shareholders of the Company in accordance with Israeli law, no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such

Parties, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and

approval of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

9.4 _ Entire Agreement_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. However, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article
III_, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided to Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or
Parent's or Merger Sub's use of, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub have relied
on, any such information, including any information, documents, estimates,
projections, forward-looking statements, business plans, forecasts or other
material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless and then only to the
extent that any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in _Article III_.

  



  

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with
respect to any other information provided to the Company in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability to the Company or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to the Company, or the Company's use of, and the Company has not
relied on, any such information, including any information, documents,
estimates, projections, forward-looking statements, business plans, forecasts
or other material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless and then only to the
extent that any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in _Article IV_.

  



  

9.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in or contemplated
by _Section _ _6.17_ , this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

9.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies in this Agreement expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

   

  



  

9.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the Parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of Israel, the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  



  

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution, existence, validity, enforceability or performance of
this Agreement, or for the breach or alleged breach hereof (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or otherwise) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction; except that provisions
related to the internal affairs of the Company, the fiduciary and other duties
of its directors, the procedures for implementing, and effects of, the Merger,
and all other provisions of, or transactions contemplated by, this Agreement
that are expressly or otherwise required to be governed by the Laws of the
State of Israel shall be governed by such Laws.

  



  

9.10 _ Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section _ _9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted
by Applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section _ _9.10_ shall affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and (c) irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in such courts, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

   

  



  

9.11 _ WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

9.12 _ Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more textually identical counterparts, all of which will be
considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery,
an " **Electronic Delivery** "), will be treated in all manner and respects as
an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as
a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

  



  

9.13 _ No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be
given to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be
cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition
in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c)
nothing set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the
extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision of this Agreement.
