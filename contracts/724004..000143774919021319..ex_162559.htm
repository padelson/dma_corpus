entitled to any other remedies. Further, the Buyer's right to make a Seller
Claim shall be subject to the relevant Seller or Sellers having been given
reasonable opportunity by the Buyer to remedy the fact, matter or circumstance
on which such Seller Claim is based during a thirty (30) day period. If and to

 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

in relation to any breach of the Fundamental Warranties, for such part of the
Loss which the Buyer is not entitled to receive compensation under the RandW
Insurance Policy, e.g. due to that the circumstances constituting the breach
have been Disclosed (as defined in the RandW Insurance Policy) or occurred
between Signing and Closing or the Loss does not exceed the retention or is in
excess of coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any Seller be responsible for Losses in excess of the

if and to the extent Losses arise out of fraud, wilful misconduct or wilful
misrepresentation by any Seller, for such part of the Loss which the Buyer is

to that such Losses do not exceed the retention or de minimis amounts, or
exceed the limit of liability, under the RandW Insurance Policy.

The Buyer shall only have the right to make a Seller Claim in the situations
referred to in Section 9.1.2a)-b) if and to the extent the Buyer cannot
receive compensation for such Loss under the RandW Insurance Policy due to such

not to pursue any such Seller Claim against the Sellers until (a) the Buyer's
right to receive compensation therefor under the RandW Insurance Policy has been
reasonably exhausted; or (b) it is obvious that no compensation under the RandW
Insurance Policy will be received (in each of (a) and (b) above, notice of
such Seller Claim may be given earlier).
