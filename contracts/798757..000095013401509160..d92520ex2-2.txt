                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION


         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "AGREEMENT") is made
and entered into as of August 14, 2001 by and among J.D. Edwards & Company, a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Hornet Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), YOUcentric,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and Laura Witt as stockholder
representative (the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE").

                                    RECITALS

         A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, the Company and Merger
Sub believe it is in the best interests of each company and their respective
stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of the
Company with and into Merger Sub (the "MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof,
have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, (i) all of the capital
stock of the Company that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK") shall be converted into the right
to receive the consideration set forth herein and (ii) certain outstanding
options to purchase Common Stock of the Company shall be assumed by Parent.

         C. A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable by
Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent, the
release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain events and conditions,
all as set forth in Article VII hereof.

         D. As a condition and further inducement to Parent to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have agreed to enter into a
Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "VOTING
Agreement"), certain key employees of the Company have agreed to enter into
Employment and Non-Competition Agreements substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS"), and
certain stockholders of the Company have agreed to enter into Stockholder

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1 The Merger

                  (a) Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DELAWARE LAW"), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. Merger Sub as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."

                  (b) Change of Structure. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 1.1(b), Parent may, at its election, acquire the Company through a
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, in which the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "REVERSE
TRIANGULAR MERGER"). If Parent so elects, the Company shall take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Parent to effect the Reverse Triangular Merger and
all references in this Agreement to the Surviving Corporation shall be to the
Company as the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not effect the Reverse Triangular Merger if the Reverse Triangular Merger
would not constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

         1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take
place as promptly as practicable, but no later than five (5) business days
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at
the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, unless another place or time is agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is herein referred
to as the "CLOSING DATE." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of Delaware (the "MERGER CERTIFICATE"), in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the time of acceptance by the
Secretary of State of Delaware of such filing being referred to herein as the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").

         1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

provided, however, that such amount may be increased, at the sole discretion of
Parent, up to an amount not to exceed $36 million or such lesser amount if
necessary to avoid jeopardizing the qualification of the Merger as a tax-free
reorganization with the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the
Code, at any time prior to the Effective Time, and such increase, if any, shall
be offset by a corresponding reduction in the number of the Merger Shares based
on the Trading Price; provided, however, that to the extent the number of Merger
Shares would have exceeded 19.99% of the outstanding Parent Common Stock but for
the limitation thereon imposed hereinbelow, the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by an amount equal to the value of such excess on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6 to the contrary, should the
aggregate bonuses payable pursuant to the Company's Management Incentive
Compensation Plan be less than $5,500,024, the Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the amount by which $1,000,000 exceeds the amount of such aggregate
bonuses which are payable in cash.

<PAGE>


                           (i) Each share of Company Capital Stock owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

                           (ii) Subject to the escrow provisions set forth in
Article VII hereof, each issued and outstanding share of Company Capital Stock
other than shares for which dissenters' rights are perfected or as provided in
Section 1.6(b)(1), shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent,
Cash Consideration and Merger Shares which shall be allocated to the holders of

Share, Series A Exchange Ratio, Series B Cash Consideration Per Share, Series B

Ratio in accordance with the Company Charter are set forth on Schedule 1.6(b).

B Cash Consideration Per Share multiplied by the number of shares of Series B
Preferred held by such stockholder, (iii) the Series C Cash Consideration Per

multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder, as the case may be. The aggregate Merger Shares to be issued to
each stockholder under this Section 1.6(b)(2) shall be calculated by
multiplying: (i) the Series A Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of Series A
Preferred held by such stockholder, (ii) the Series B Exchange Ratio by the
number of shares of Series B Preferred held by such stockholder, (iii) the
Series C Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of Series C Preferred held by
such stockholder, and (iv) the Company Common Stock Exchange Ratio by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder, as the case may be,
with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.6(c).

                           (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the maximum amount of Cash Consideration and the maximum number of
shares of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Trading Price to be issued
(including Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of all
of the Company Options) as consideration for all outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall not exceed the Merger Consideration.

                  (c) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, without any



                                      -8-
<PAGE>

interest, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Trading Price.

                  (d) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option
then outstanding under the Company's 1999 Equity Compensation Plan, 2000 Equity
Compensation Plan and 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the "OPTION PLANS") or otherwise shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with provisions described below:

                           (i) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company Option pursuant to Option Plans or otherwise, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Parent; provided, however, that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all necessary action to terminate
the Company Options set forth on Schedule 1.6(d), and such Company Options,
therefore, (A) shall not be assumed by Parent and (B) shall be of no further
force or effect at the Effective Time. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions set forth in the Option Plans and/or as provided in the
respective option agreements governing such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that (A) such Company Option shall be exercisable
(when vested) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Company Option Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company Option Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.

                           (ii) It is the intention of the parties that the
Company Options assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the extent the
Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

                           (iii) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
will issue to each holder of an outstanding Company Option a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent.

                  (e) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares of Common
Stock of Merger Sub shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such
shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (f) Rounding. All calculations made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be rounded to the nearest .00000001, with .000000005 being rounded up. All
such calculations shall be performed by the Company in accordance herewith.

                  (g) Lock-Up. The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under
this Agreement are subject to a lock-up restriction ("LOCK-UP") pursuant to
which no shares may be transferred except as provided below. With respect to the
total shares of Parent Common Stock received by each Company stockholder in the
Merger or held in the Escrow for such stockholder's benefit pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Lock-Up shall lapse as to (i) up to 17% commencing
on the Closing, and (ii) up to an additional 20.75% on the last day of each
consecutive 30-day period following the Closing. Each Company stockholder shall
receive five certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable to such stockholder pursuant to this Agreement and such certificates
shall bear legends substantially as set forth in Schedule 1.6(g) hereto.

         1.7 Dissenting Shares.

                  (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded
and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
granted by Delaware Law.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who is otherwise entitled to exercise
dissenters' rights under Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such dissenters' rights, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive Parent Common Stock and payment for any fractional share as provided in
Section 1.6(c), without interest on the payment, if any, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares.

                  (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for the exercise of dissenters' rights in respect of any shares
of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law (including without limitation instruments
concerning appraisal or dissenters' rights) and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for the
exercise of dissenters' rights in respect of any shares of Company Capital Stock
or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in

         1.8 Exchange Procedures; Surrender of Certificates.

                  (a) Exchange Agent. Parent's transfer agent shall serve as
Exchange Agent in the Merger.

                  (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, the aggregate Merger Shares issuable pursuant
to Section 1.6 hereof, the Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6
hereof and the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in exchange for the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, none of which will be used or
distributed other than in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that, on
behalf of the holders of Company Capital Stock, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deposit into an escrow account a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate Merger Shares. The portion
of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital
Stock shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Section 1.6
by virtue of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

                  (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but not more than ten (10) business days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and
which shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive within five business days
following the surrender of such certificate and a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal in exchange therefor (i) certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (less the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such
holder's behalf pursuant to Article VII hereof), plus the Cash Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f), to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6, and (ii) any dividends or other
distributions, if any, to which holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(d)
(the "ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS"), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Article VII hereof, Parent shall cause to
be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article VII) a certificate or
certificates representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Escrow Amount, which certificate shall be registered in the name of the
Escrow Agent. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by the holders on whose
behalf such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be available to
compensate Parent as provided in Article VII. From the Closing and until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent solely (i) ownership of
the number of full shares of



                                      -11-
<PAGE>

Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration into which such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall have been so exchanged and (ii) the right to receive the
Additional Payments, if any.

                  (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or
made with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

                  (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid in good faith to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

         1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon receiving notice from the holder thereof
and upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by such holder, such shares of
Parent Common Stock, Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, and
the Additional Payments, if any; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably and customarily direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be



                                      -12-
<PAGE>

made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         1.11 Tax and Accounting Consequences. It is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code by reason of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax
Regulations. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall be
treated as a "purchase" for accounting purposes.

         1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or reasonably desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the
name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action.

violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

both, could constitute a default under any such Lease Agreement. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of a default,
alleged failure to perform, or any offset or counterclaim with respect to any

or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor
practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Except as set
forth in Schedule 2.26(k), neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
presently, nor have they been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees and

subsidiaries, no employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (a) is in
violation of any term of any employment contract, patent disclosure agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or presently
proposed to be conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to the use
of trade secrets or proprietary information of others and (b) has given notice
to the Company or any subsidiary, nor is the Company or any subsidiary otherwise

in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (herein collectively
called "COMPANY AUTHORIZATIONS"), which Company Authorizations are in full force
and effect and constitute all Company Authorizations required to permit the
Company and each of its subsidiaries to operate or conduct their business or
hold any interest in its properties or assets.

hereof. The financial statements of Parent, including the notes thereto,
included in the SEC Documents (the "PARENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except as may be

unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments).

         3.5 No Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not,
and, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), or give rise to a Conflict under (a) any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) any
mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument, permit,

judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective properties or assets, except in each
case where such Conflict will not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or will
not have an affect on the legality, validity or enforceability of this
Agreement.

         3.6 Consents. No consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any

Certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, (b) such consents, waivers,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable securities laws and the HSR Act and other
similar anti-trust requirements of foreign governmental authorities, (c) such

materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

than disclosure by the Company to its authorized representatives, consultants

disclose any confidential information related to the terms of this Agreement or

                                    ARTICLE V

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         5.1 Exemption from Registration or Registration Statement.

                  (a) Parent initially intends to issue the shares of Parent
Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the procedures described in Section 5.1(b)
hereof. Parent may elect, in its reasonable discretion, to issue the shares of
Parent Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the Registration Statement as provided
in Section 5.1(c) hereof in lieu of obtaining a North Carolina Permit by
providing written notice of such election to the Stockholder Representative. If
after filing the relevant document to obtain a North Carolina Permit pursuant to
Section 5.1(b) hereof, it shall become reasonably apparent that Parent will not
be able to obtain the North Carolina permit within the time period that Parent
would otherwise have been able to prepare and file the Registration Statement
and have the same be declared effective following a full review, Parent shall
issue the shares of Parent Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the Registration
Statement as provided in Section 5.1(c) hereof.

                  (b) Unless Parent shall have elected to issue the shares of
Parent Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the Registration Statement, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall prepare the necessary documents, and Parent shall apply to obtain
an order of approval (a "NORTH CAROLINA PERMIT") from the Secretary of State of
the State of North Carolina (after a hearing before such Secretary) pursuant to
Section 78A-30 of the North Carolina Securities Act. The Company and Parent will
respond to any comments from the Secretary of State of North Carolina and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to have the North Carolina Permit granted
as soon as practicable after such filing, if applicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company, in consultation with Parent, will prepare an information statement (the
"INFORMATION STATEMENT") to be used in connection with obtaining the approval by
the Company's stockholders of this Agreement. The Company shall cause the
Information Statement and any other disclosure documents reasonably deemed
appropriate by Parent to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company promptly
upon receipt of a North Carolina Permit. The Company shall not distribute the
Information Statement without Parent's approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall in no way be responsible for any of the content of the Information
Statement except as it pertains to and is supplied by Parent, Merger



                                      -45-
<PAGE>

Sub or the Company, as the case may be. Parent shall be responsible for any fees
imposed by the North Carolina Secretary of State in connection with obtaining
the North Carolina Permit.

                  (c) In the event that Parent shall elect or is otherwise
required to issue the shares of Parent Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the
Registration Statement, the Company and Parent shall prepare, and Parent shall
file with the SEC, the Registration Statement, which shall include a proxy
statement and prospectus (the "PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS"), to register under
the Securities Act the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall respond to any comments of
the SEC, and use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared or ordered effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company at the
earliest practicable time after the Registration Statement shall have become
effective. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company and
Parent shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act with respect to the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger. Each party hereto shall notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement or for additional information, and shall supply the
other party with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement.
Parent and the Company shall comply in all material respects with all
requirements of law applicable to such party in connection with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement. Whenever any event occurs
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party hereto of such occurrence
and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and/or mailing to the
stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement. Each of Parent and
the Company shall in no way be responsible to the other for any of the content
of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus except as it
pertains to and is supplied by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.

         5.2 Meetings of Stockholders. The Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws to convene a meeting of its stockholders (the "STOCKHOLDERS'
MEETING"), to be held as promptly as practicable or, if applicable, on such
later date as may be required by the Secretary of State of North Carolina after
the issuance of a North Carolina Permit (in the event that Parent shall issue
the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.1(a)), or to be held as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act (in the event that Parent shall issue the shares of
Parent Common Stock hereunder pursuant to the Registration Statement), for the
purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as appropriate. In connection therewith, (a)
the Board of Directors of the Company shall approve this Agreement and declare
its advisability, and recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement at the Stockholders' Meeting, and
(b) the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, shall



                                      -46-
<PAGE>

include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has
recommended that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of and adopt and
approve this Agreement at the Stockholders' Meeting. The Proxy Statement shall
specify that adoption of this Agreement shall constitute approval by the
stockholders of the Company of: (i) the escrow and all other provisions of
Article VII hereof and the deposit of that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund and (ii) in favor of the
appointment of Laura Witt as Stockholder Representative, under and as defined in
this Agreement. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the
Stockholders' Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for absence
of a quorum) the Stockholders' Meeting without the consent of Parent. The
Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the consent of its stockholders
sufficient to approve this Agreement and to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable. The Company shall give its stockholders sufficient
notice such that no stockholder will be able to exercise appraisal rights if
such stockholder has not perfected such appraisal rights prior to Closing,
pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law.

         In addition, the Company shall (i) simultaneously submit for approval
by the stockholders of the Company by the requisite vote any payments or
benefits that may be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code, such that all such payments or benefits shall not be
deemed to be "parachute payments" pursuant to proposed regulations issued
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or shall be exempt from such treatment
under such Section 280G, or (ii) deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to
Parent that such requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained with
respect to any payment or benefit that may be deemed to constitute a "parachute
payment" within the meaning of the proposed regulations issued pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code and, as a consequence, that such "parachute payment"
shall not be made or provided. Schedule 5.2 lists all persons who the Company
reasonably believes are, with respect to the Company or any Affiliate,
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder) as determined as of the date hereof. On
or about the date which is five (5) business days prior to the expected date of
the Closing, the Company shall, as and to the extent necessary, deliver to
Parent a revised Schedule 5.2, which sets forth any additional information which
the Company reasonably believes would affect the determination of the persons
who are, with respect to the Company or any Affiliate, deemed to be
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder) as of the date of each such revised
Schedule 5.2.

         5.3 Access to Information. The Company shall afford Parent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during the
period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time to (a) all of the
Company's and its subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, including the Company's and its subsidiaries' source code, other than
the source code for the framework layer of the Company's software, (b) all other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to
restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company and its subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, and (c) all Employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries identified by Parent. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial
statements (including Tax returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon
request. No information or knowledge



                                      -47-

transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses.

         5.6 Public Disclosure. No party shall issue any statement or
communication to any third party (other than their respective agents) regarding
the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons
therefor, without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except that this restriction shall be subject to Parent's
obligation to comply with applicable securities laws and Nasdaq Stock Market
regulations.

         5.7 Consents. The Company shall obtain all necessary consents, waivers
and approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under those Contracts identified on Schedule 6.3(c).

to Parent a properly executed statement (a "FIRPTA COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE") in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parent's
obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

         5.9 Tax Matters. None of the parties hereto shall, nor shall they cause
or permit their respective affiliates to, take any action that would be
reasonably expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         5.10 Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions provided
in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and
to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions
or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose
of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this



                                      -48-

Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any
divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's subsidiaries or
affiliates, of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of
Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or of the Company, its affiliates, or
the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock. As soon as may be reasonably practicable, to the extent
not already filed, each of the Company and Parent shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the Notification and Report
Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR
Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of applicable jurisdiction, as
agreed to by the parties. The Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply
the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of
any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.

         5.11 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
at or prior to the Effective Time, and (b) any failure of the Company to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any
remedies available to the party receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an
acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the
Company pursuant to this Section 5.11, however, shall be deemed to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

         5.12 Additional Documents and Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at
the request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other

applicable SEC regulations.

         5.14 New Employment Arrangements. At the discretion of Parent, each
person who is an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing Date shall be offered "at-will" employment by Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof of
citizenship or appropriate employment authorization from the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service or the U.S. Department of State evidencing a right to
work in the United States. Such "at-will" employment arrangements may (a) be set
forth in offer letters based on Parent's standard form (each, an "OFFER
LETTER"), (b) be subject to and in compliance with Parent's



                                      -49-
<PAGE>

applicable human resources policies and procedures, (c) have terms, including
the position, salary and responsibilities of such employee, which will be
determined by Parent after consultation with the Company's management, and (d)
supersede any prior employment agreements and other arrangements with such
employee in effect prior to the Closing Date. Each employee listed on Schedule
5.14 hereto (each, a "KEY EMPLOYEE") shall execute an Employment Agreement, at
the same time as the execution of this Agreement or as soon as possible
thereafter, which Employment Agreements shall be effective as of the Closing
Date. Each employee of the Company who remains an employee of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date shall be referred to hereafter as a
"CONTINUING EMPLOYEE." Effective at the Effective Time, Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with Parent's applicable human
resources policies. Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation or
appropriate subsidiary of Parent to give Continuing Employees full credit under
such policies for prior service at the Company or its subsidiaries for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (subject to the terms of any new vesting arrangement
to take effect at the Effective Time). Parent shall make commercially reasonably
efforts to cause the tax-qualified retirement plan in which Continuing Employees

distributions made to Continuing Employees under the Company's retirement plan
to the extent permitted by law.

         5.15 Voting Agreement. The Company shall deliver or cause to be

Stockholders' Meeting. The Company shall provide Parent such information and
documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such
list. The Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement (and in any case prior to the Closing Date)
from each of the Affiliates of the Company that beneficially own Company Capital
Stock, an executed Stockholder Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by such
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common
Stock, consistent with the terms of such Stockholder Agreements.

preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement; provided,
however, that Parent requests termination of such Company Employee Plans by
sending a written notice to the Company at least five business days prior to the
Effective Time. If Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s)
have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to



                                      -50-

consideration paid by the Company for the termination of such Company Warrant
exceeds $32,000, then the amount of consideration in excess of such $32,000
shall constitute "Losses" recoverable under the Escrow Agreement, and such
Losses shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount.

         5.19 Spreadsheet. The Company shall prepare a spreadsheet (the
"SPREADSHEET") in form acceptable to Parent, which spreadsheet shall be
certified as complete and correct by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief
Financial Officer of the Company as of the Closing and which shall separately
list, as of the Closing, all Stockholders and their respective addresses as
reflected in the Company's records, the number of shares of Company Capital

Incorporation, the Company's Bylaws and those indemnification agreements listed

and continue in full force and effect following the Effective Time for a period
equal to the statute of limitations for any such claims against such officers
and directors, and the obligations related thereto will be assumed by Parent for
such period.

the current status of the prospectus required thereby shall be maintained in
accordance with the relevant requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act) at least for so long as any Company Options assumed by Parent remain
outstanding.

         5.22 Nasdaq National Market Listing. No later than the Effective Time,

not settle such claims if, as a condition to such settlement, the Company pays
or becomes obligated to pay any amount in excess of $70,000.

         5.24 Termination of Certain Company Options. No later than 10 business
days prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company a list of

                  (g) Employment Agreements. Each of the Key Employees shall
have executed and delivered to Parent an Employment Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B, and at least ninety percent (90%) of such
Employment Agreements shall be in full force and effect.

                  (h) New Employment Arrangements. Excluding the employees
identified on Schedule 6.3(h) and any other employees to whom the Parent does
not offer an "at-will" employment arrangement, at least 70% of the remaining
employees employed by the Company as of the date of this Agreement shall
continue to be employees on the Closing Date.

                  (p) Company Material Adverse Change. There shall not have
occurred any Company Material Adverse Change.

                                   ARTICLE VII

               SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW

         7.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. Notwithstanding any
right of Parent or the Company (whether or not exercised) to investigate the
affairs of Parent or the Company (whether pursuant to Section 5.3 or otherwise)
or a waiver by Parent or the Company of any condition to Closing set forth in
Article VI, each party shall have the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. All of the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Merger and continue until 5:00 p.m., EDT, on the date that is ten
(10) months following the Closing Date (the "EXPIRATION DATE"). The covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement and any ancillary document hereto
shall not expire and shall survive indefinitely. The representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall
terminate at the Closing.

         7.2 Escrow Arrangements.

                  (a) Escrow Fund. At the Effective Time the Company's
stockholders will be deemed to have received and consented to the deposit with
the Escrow Agent (as defined below) of the Escrow Amount (plus any additional
shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization
effected by Parent after the Effective Time), without any act required on the
part of any stockholder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Escrow Amount, without any act required on the part of any stockholder, will be
deposited with an escrow agent acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (as defined in Section 7.2(i)(i) below) as Escrow Agent (the
"ESCROW AGENT"), such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND")
to be governed by the terms set forth herein and at Parent's cost and expense.
The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each stockholder of
the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.6(b). The Escrow Amount
shall be funded entirely out of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
the Merger in respect of Company Capital Stock. The Escrow Fund is available to
compensate Parent and its officers, directors and affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation (any, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, and expenses of investigation and defenses (hereinafter individually a
"LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES") incurred by the Indemnified Parties, or any of
them, directly or indirectly as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article II herein, (ii)
any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant contained
herein, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, or (iv) any claim made by any
person that such person is or was entitled (by contract or otherwise) to receive
any amount or property in such person's



                                      -57-
<PAGE>

capacity (or asserted capacity) as a holder of equity interests in the Company
or contingent equity interests or as a beneficiary of any rights in excess of
the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement by virtue of or as a result
of the Merger, other than any claim described in clause (iii) above. Parent and
the Company each acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to
unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at
the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate Merger
consideration. Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close.

         For the purpose of this Article VII only, in the event of any
inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Article II herein (determined giving effect to any requirement in any
representation or warranty that an event or fact be material or have a Material
Adverse Effect), the amount of any Loss resulting from such inaccuracy or breach
of such representation or warranty shall be determined without giving effect to
any requirement in any representation or warranty that an event or fact be
material or have a Material Adverse Effect, and any such requirement shall be
disregarded for such purpose. There shall be no right of contribution from any
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss. The Escrow Agent may execute this
Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later
execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding
nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories
hereto.

                  (b) Threshold. No Indemnified Party may recover any Losses
unless and until one or more Officer's Certificates identifying a Loss or Losses
in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT") has or have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.2(e) hereof, in which
case such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses (including
the Threshold Amount) so identified to the extent then available in the Escrow
Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to recover for,
and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims
or payments made with respect to:

                           (i) all Losses incurred pursuant to clause (iii) or
(iv) of Section 7.2(a) hereof;

                           (ii) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct;

                           (iii) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty contained in Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure), Section 2.10(d)
(Tax and Other Returns and Reports) (to the extent such Losses are in excess of
accruals for such matters as set forth on the Current Balance Sheet), the first
sentence of Section 2.25 (Brokers' and Finders' Fees), the last sentence of
Sections 2.26(d) and (j) (Employee Matters and Benefit Plans) (to the extent
such Losses are in excess of accruals for such matters as set forth on the
Current Balance Sheet);

                           (iv) all Losses incurred pursuant to Section 6.3(c)
(Third Party Consents) and Section 5.18 (Termination of Agreements); or



                                      -58-
<PAGE>

                           (v) all Losses resulting under or related to the
matters described in Schedule 7.2(b).

                  (c) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow
Periods. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00
p.m., EDT on the Expiration Date (the "ESCROW PERIOD"). Promptly following the
Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the Exchange Agent or
stockholders of the Company, pursuant to written instructions by Parent, the
remaining Escrow Fund, if any; provided that the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to such amount (or some portion thereof), that is
necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent (subject to reduction as may be
determined by arbitration of the matter as provided in Section 7.2(g) hereof in
the event of the objection of the Stockholder Representative in the manner
provided in Section 7.2(f) hereof) to satisfy any unsatisfied claims concerning
facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of such Escrow Period
and to the extent specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow
Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims
have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the stockholders of the
Company, pursuant to written instructions by Parent, the remaining portion of
the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of Escrow
Amounts to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall
be made in proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow
Fund.

                  (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

                           (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the
Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent
and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                           (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other
equity securities issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon
a stock split) ("NEW SHARES") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow
Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund as of the time of such
issuance or distribution by Parent shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become
a part thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the
Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the recordholders thereof. New Shares
issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from
the Escrow Fund as of the time of such issuance or distribution by Parent shall
not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the recordholders
thereof.

                           (iii) Each stockholder shall be entitled to control
the vote of the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
such stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in
respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock), and the Escrow Agent in whose
name the shares are held shall vote such shares on all matters as instructed by
the respective stockholders in writing.

                  (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

                           (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on
or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent (an "OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE"): (A) stating that Parent has paid
or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue
Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly
accrued, or the basis for such reasonably anticipated liability, and the nature
of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(f)
hereof, transfer to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable,
shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such
Losses. Such payments of shares from the Escrow Fund will be made pro rata in
proportion to the stockholders' original contributions to the Escrow Fund.

                           (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(i) hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
valued at the Trading Price. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
certify such fair market value in a certificate signed by both Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, and shall deliver such certificate to the Escrow
Agent.

                  (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate
shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative and for a period of thirty
(30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no transfer to Parent
of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(e) hereof unless the Escrow Agent
shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to
make such transfer. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the
Escrow Agent shall transfer shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund
in accordance with Section 7.2(e) hereof, provided that no such transfer may be
made if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to
the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period.

                  (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

                           (i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall
object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate as
provided in Section 7.2(f) hereof, the Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute
shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof.

                           (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, in which event



                                      -60-
<PAGE>

arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall
set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost
and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in
the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the
opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall
rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to
impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court
of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was
sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the
three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement,
and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(f) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments
out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written
and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall
set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators. If an
Indemnified Party claims that it has incurred a Loss by reason of the inaccuracy
or breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 2.10, and such
Loss is reflected on a Tax Return prepared by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party, then, unless there has been a final determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, (A) there shall be no presumption of correctness or
incorrectness applied to such Tax Return; and (B) the Indemnified Party shall
not prevail to the extent that the arbitrators determine that there was
"substantial authority" (for purposes of Section 6662 of the Code) for a Tax
Return position that would not have resulted in a Loss.

                           (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in Denver County, Colorado under the rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section
7.2(g), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof
stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be
the prevailing party in the event that the arbitrators award Parent an amount
equal to at least the sum of one-half (1/2) of the disputed amount plus any
amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the stockholders of the Company as
represented by the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to be the
prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own
expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the
arbitration, and the expenses, including without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

                  (h) Escrow as the Sole Remedy. The Escrow Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive source of satisfaction of any claim made by the Indemnified
Parties for any Losses resulting from the matters set forth in this Article VII;
provided that nothing herein shall limit any remedy of an Indemnified Party for
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and nothing herein
shall limit the liability of the Company or Parent for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing shall
prohibit Parent from seeking and obtaining recourse against the Company's



                                      -61-
<PAGE>

stockholders, or any of them, in the event that Parent issues to the Company's
stockholders, or any of them, more than the number of Merger Shares or Cash
Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled pursuant to Article I of
this Agreement.

                  (i) Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney.

                           (i) In the event that the Merger is approved,
effective upon such vote, and without further act of any stockholder, Laura Witt
shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE") for each stockholder of the Company (except such stockholders,
if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or dissenters' rights under
Delaware Law), for and on behalf of the stockholders of the Company, to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of
Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to
object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the stockholders
of the Company from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; provided that the Stockholder Representative may not
be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the
position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by approval of the holders
of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive
compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
stockholders of the Company.

                           (ii) Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any
agent employed by him shall be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Stockholder Representative, except for his or her gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The stockholders of the Company on whose behalf the Escrow Amount
was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall severally on a pro rata basis (based on
the Merger Shares to which such stockholders are entitled) indemnify the
Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative; provided, however,
that each stockholder's obligation to indemnify the Stockholder Representative
under this Agreement shall be limited to, and payable from, each stockholder's
pro rata interest in the Escrow Fund. The Stockholder Representative shall be
protected in acting upon any notice, statement or certificate believed by him to
be genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate person and in acting or
refusing to act in good faith on any matter.

                  (j) Actions of the Stockholder Representative. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a
decision of all the stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount
otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund



                                      -62-
<PAGE>

and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such stockholders, and
the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each every such stockholder of the Company. The Escrow
Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any
acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholder Representative.

                  (k) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a
third-party claim that Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against
the Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such
claim, and the Stockholder Representative, as representative for the
stockholders of the Company, shall be entitled, at his expense, to participate
in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion
to control the defense of all such claims and to settle any such claim;
provided, however, that no settlement of any such claim with third-party
claimants shall alone be determinative of the amount of any claim against the
Escrow Fund, except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement
and acknowledged that the claim is a valid claim against the Escrow Fund, the
Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed to the claim by Parent
against the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such settlement.

                  (l) Escrow Agent's Duties.

                           (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the
performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set
forth in any additional written escrow instructions that the Escrow Agent may
receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent
and the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in
relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow
Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and
any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith, provided that the Escrow Agent has exercised
reasonable care in the selection of such counsel.

                           (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized
to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any
other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby
expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any
court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment
or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
jurisdiction.

                           (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any
respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing
or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any
documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder absent gross negligence or
willful misconduct.



                                      -63-
<PAGE>

                           (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the
expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this
Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent absent gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

                           (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses,
except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or
failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted
in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe
to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority.
In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection
with Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in
any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel provided that the Escrow Agent has exercised
reasonable care in the selection of such counsel. The Escrow Agent is not
responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

                           (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to
this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this
Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent
may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings. In
such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage.

         Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights
among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of
the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except
all cost, expenses, charges and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Escrow
Agent due to the interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally
agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
released and discharged of and from all obligations and liabilities imposed by
the terms of this Agreement.

                           (vii) The parties and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses,
including reasonable costs of investigation, attorneys fees, and disbursements
that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection
with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not
limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject
matter.

                           (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon
giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided,
however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment
of a successor escrow agent, which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties
shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent
within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to
agree upon a successor escrow agent



                                      -64-
<PAGE>

within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor
escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of Delaware. The successor
escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment
and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties,
rights, powers and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named
as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties
and liability under this Agreement.

                  (m) Fees. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its
duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and
usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent
shall be reasonably compensated by Parent for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, and expenses occasioned by such
default, delay, controversy or litigation.

or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

                  (b) by either the Company or Parent if: (i) the Effective Time
has not occurred by January 14, 2002 (i) provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this clause 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;
(ii) there shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in
effect preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed

of the Merger illegal;

                  (c) by either Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger, which order, decree or ruling is final and nonappealable;

                  (d) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit

Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not then be satisfied; provided that if
such inaccuracy in Parent's or Merger Sub's representations and warranties or
breach by Parent or Merger Sub is curable by Parent through the exercise of its
commercially reasonable efforts, then Company may only terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(e) if the breach is not cured within thirty (30) days
following the date of written notice from Company of such breach (but no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured); or

                  (f) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not then be satisfied; provided, that if
such inaccuracy in the Company's representations and warranties or breach by the
Company is curable by the Company through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts, then Parent may only terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(f) if the breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following the
date of written notice from Parent of such breach (but no cure period shall be
required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured); or

                  (g) by Parent, if a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred after the date of this Agreement, and such Company Material Adverse
Effect has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days; provided, however,
that no cure period shall be required for a Company Material Adverse Effect
which by its nature cannot be cured.

         Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1, it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the
Board of Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.

         8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders;
provided that each party shall remain liable for any breaches of this Agreement
prior to its termination; and provided further that the provisions of Sections
5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and Article VIII of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time only by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Following the Effective

obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the

the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

         9.6 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

         9.7 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

         9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

         9.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

         9.10 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and

Agreement are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third
party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client,
customer, affiliate, partner of any party hereto or any other person or entity
unless specifically provided otherwise herein.

                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1
                                       TO
                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION



         This AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the
"AMENDMENT") is made and entered into as of October 3, 2001 by and among J.D.
Edwards & Company, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Hornet Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("MERGER SUB"), YOUcentric, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and
Laura Witt as stockholder representative (the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE").
Capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Reorganization Agreement.

                                    RECITALS

         A. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder Representative
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of August 14,
2001 (the "REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT").

         B. Pursuant to Section 8.3 of the Reorganization Agreement, the
Reorganization Agreement may be amended at any time by a written instrument
executed by each of the parties thereto.

         C. The parties hereto desire to amend the Reorganization Agreement as
set forth herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

         In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises set forth herein,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties agree as follows:

         1. Amendment. The first paragraph of Section 7.2(a) of the
Reorganization Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety as
follows:

         "(a) Escrow Fund. At the Effective Time the Company's stockholders will
be deemed to have received and consented to the deposit with the Escrow Agent
(as defined below) of the Escrow Amount (plus any additional shares as may be
issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by
Parent after the Effective Time and less any shares that may be deposited
therewith by the participants in the Management Incentive Compensation Plan),
without any act required on the part of any stockholder. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act required on the
part of any stockholder, will be deposited with an escrow agent acceptable to
Parent and the Stockholder Representative (as defined in Section 7.2(i)(i)
below) as Escrow Agent (the "ESCROW AGENT"), such deposit to constitute an
escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") to be governed by the terms set forth herein and
at Parent's cost and expense. The portion of the Escrow Amount (less the value
of any shares that may be deposited into the Escrow Fund by the participants in
the Management Incentive Compensation Plan) contributed on behalf of each
stockholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.6(b). The
Escrow Amount shall be funded entirely out of (i) the shares



                                       1
<PAGE>

of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the Merger in respect of Company Capital
Stock and (ii) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the participants in
the Management Incentive Compensation Plan pursuant thereto. The Escrow Fund is
available to compensate Parent and its officers, directors and affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation (any, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and
collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), for any claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses, and expenses of investigation and defenses (hereinafter
individually a "LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES") incurred by the Indemnified
Parties, or any of them, directly or indirectly as a result of (i) any
inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Article II herein, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any
covenant contained herein, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, or (iv) any
claim made by any person that such person is or was entitled (by contract or
otherwise) to receive any amount or property in such person's capacity (or
asserted capacity) as a holder of equity interests in the Company or contingent
equity interests or as a beneficiary of any rights in excess of the
consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement by virtue of or as a result of
the Merger, other than any claim described in clause (iii) above. Parent and the
Company each acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective
Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate Merger consideration.
Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close."

         2. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court within the State of Colorado, in connection with any
matter based upon or arising out of this Amendment or the matters contemplated
herein, other than issues involving the corporate governance of any of the
parties hereto, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Colorado for such persons and waives and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection that they might otherwise have to
such jurisdiction and such process.

         3. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AMENDMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

         4. Amendment Limited. Except as provided herein, each of the provisions
of the Reorganization Agreement shall remain in full force and effect following
the execution of this Amendment.

         5. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.



                                       2

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
signed by their duly authorized respective officers as of the date first written
above.
