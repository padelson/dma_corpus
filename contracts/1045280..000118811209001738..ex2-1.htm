THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of August 4, 2009, by and among Google Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Oxide Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Sub"), and On2 Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

 

 

RECITALS

 

 

A. The respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and the Company
believe it advisable and in the best interests of each such respective
corporation and its respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved this Agreement and the Merger;

 

 

B. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(as defined below), and that this Agreement shall be, and hereby is, adopted
as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g); and

 

 

C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's and Sub's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Key Employees (as defined below) shall have entered
into and delivered to Parent an offer letter and at-will employment,
confidential information, invention assignment and arbitration agreement
(together, the "Offer Letter").

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements, covenants and other premises set forth herein, the mutual
benefits to be gained by the performance thereof, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. At the
Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The surviving
corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to hereinafter as the
"Surviving Corporation."

 

 

1.2 Closing; Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the second Business Day
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time), at the offices of Parent, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
View, California 94043, unless another time or place is mutually agreed upon
in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing
actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the "Closing Date." On the
Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as
is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the
applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing (or such
later time as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties that is specified
in the Certificate of Merger) shall be referred to herein as the
"Effective Time").


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-1-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended and restated as of the
Effective Time to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that Article First
of the certificate of incorporation shall (i) read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is On2 Technologies, Inc." and (ii) provide that the
sole incorporator shall continue to be the sole incorporator of the Company)
and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL
and as provided in such certificate of incorporation.

 

 

(b) The bylaws of the Company shall be amended as of the Effective Time to be
identical to the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as
provided in such bylaws.

 

 

1.5 Directors and Officers.

 

 

(a) Directors of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold the office of
a director of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of

Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of

remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the
Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise
according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not surrendered such

after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to the
Surviving Corporation for delivery or payment of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu
of any fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section

the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond
in such reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

furnish to any Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide,
written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing that the Company Board
reasonably concludes (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a
Financial Advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its

Disclosure Agreement, provided further, however, that, in the case of any
action taken pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated (or be
deemed, pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.1, to have breached or

to be a breach of this Section 5.1 by the Company. The Company shall not
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract
(other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted by Section

information relating exclusively to Hantro or afford access to the business,
properties assets, books or records of Hantro to any Person or (ii)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with

knowingly facilitates or knowingly induces the making, submission or
announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal in connection with or as a result of
the activities set forth in clause (i) or (ii).

Acquisition Proposal (and, if the Acquisition Proposal is in written form,
the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof, along with any other written
information delivered to the Company from such Person or its advisors, agents
or other intermediaries), (ii) any request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any
inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal, and, with respect to each of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

  (f) Until such time as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article

amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition
to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight

an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry relating to a potential Acquisition
Proposal.

 

 

5.2   Company Board Recommendation.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms of Section 5.2(b), the Company Board shall
recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the
"Company Board Recommendation").

 

 

 (b) Subject to the terms of this Section 5.2(b), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (a
"Company Board Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Merger Approval, if and only if (i) (x) the Company Board has received an
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) there is any
Intervening Event, (ii) if such Company Board Recommendation Change is
pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(i)(x), neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated (or be deemed, pursuant to the
terms hereof, to have breached or violated) the provisions of Section 5.1 in
any material respect, (iii) the Company Board reasonably determines (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith
any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (v) below),
that, in light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable,
the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (iv) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have provided Parent with (A)
if such Company Board Recommendation Change is pursuant to Section
5.2(b)(i)(x), the most current version of any written agreement or proposal
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, or (B)
if such Company Board Recommendation Change is pursuant to Section
5.2(b)(i)(y), information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable
detail, (v) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business
Days notice that it is prepared to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, as
applicable, and, if requested by Parent, the opportunity to meet with the
Company and its outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of
enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith any modification of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected without a Company Board
Recommendation Change, and (vi) Parent shall not have made, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of the Company's written notice of its intention
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, a counter-offer or proposal
that the Company Board reasonably determines, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a Financial Advisor, is at least as favorable to
the Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, obviates the need for a Company Board Recommendation
Change as a result of an Intervening Event.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-42-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that, in each
case, any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of
Article VII; and provided further, however, that any such statement or
disclosure (other than a factually accurate public statement by the Company
that does no more than describe the Company's receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto or a "stop,
look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, and within the time period contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change if

terminate this Agreement, (ii) affect any other obligation of the Company
under this Agreement, (iii) limit the obligation of the Company to duly call,

Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (the "Merger Proposal") at a meeting
of the Company Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly
as practicable following the date hereof (subject to Section 5.3(c) and
subject to such delay, postponement or adjournment as is required to comply
with any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus).

 

 

(b) Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation

Stockholders (i) in favor of the Merger Proposal and (ii) to approve the
adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the Company Stockholder Meeting to adopt the Merger Proposal. At the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall submit to a vote of the Company
Stockholders the Merger Proposal. The Company shall not propose for
consideration or submit for a vote any Acquisition Proposal at the Company
Stockholder Meeting other than the Merger Proposal (or an adjournment of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, if permitted hereunder) without the prior
written consent of Parent. The Company shall not establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene or hold any meeting of the Company Stockholders
unless and until the Company Stockholder Meeting has been held, a vote of the
Company Stockholders has been taken on the Merger Proposal, and the Company
Stockholder Meeting has been adjourned. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 5.3(b), this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company Stockholders
at the Company Stockholder Meeting to obtain the Requisite Merger Approval,
and the Company's obligations under this Section 5.3 shall not be
terminated, superseded, limited, modified or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or by any Company Board
Recommendation Change (whether or not in compliance with the terms hereof).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may and, if reasonably requested by Parent, shall adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
filed and provided to the Company Stockholders (but in any event no more than
five (5) Business Days), (ii) if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting
or (iii) as required by applicable Law.

 

 

(d) Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 5.2(b), the
Company Board shall not withdraw, alter, modify, change or revoke its

other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during
the period from the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement or the Effective Time to (i) the properties, books,
contracts and records (including access to design processes and methodologies
and all source code and financial statements (including Returns and
supporting documentation)) of the Company as Parent may reasonably request,
(ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel
of the Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) Employees of the
Company as reasonably requested and identified by Parent; provided, however,
that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (x)
any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (y) such disclosure would, based on the
advice of the Company's counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other privilege applicable to such
information or (z) such disclosure relates to individual performance or
personnel evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel
information that in the Company's good faith opinion could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to liability. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.

 

 

(b) The Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall give prompt notice to
the other party of: (i) the occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely
to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to
the Effective Time such that it would result in failure of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), and (ii) any failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that it
would result in failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.3(a), respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any update of or
modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made
after the date hereof shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI.

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon obtaining Knowledge of any
written notice or other written communication (including e-mail) received by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party, subsequent to
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging (i) any
material breach of or material default under any Material Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) that any material
consent is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(d) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors or executive officers by any of the Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation, shall consider Parent's views with respect to such
stockholder litigation, and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation
without the prior written consent of Parent, which, if such settlement is for
cash only, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
information obtained pursuant to the access granted or notification provided
pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to (i) amend or otherwise modify
in any respect any representation or warranty of the party hereto providing
such access or notice, (ii) impair or otherwise prejudice in any manner
rights of the party receiving such access or notice to rely upon the
conditions to the obligations of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) impair or otherwise limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such access or notice. The terms
and conditions of the Confidential Disclosure Agreement shall apply to any
information acquired or provided pursuant to this Section 5.4.

 

 

5.5   Confidentiality. Parent, Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that
Parent and the Company have previously executed a Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated as of November 10, 2008, as amended, (the "Confidential
Disclosure Agreement"), which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

 

5.6   Public Disclosure. Except with regard to a Company Board
Recommendation Change permitted and effected pursuant to Section 5.2(b),
each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the other before issuing
any press release or making any public announcement or statement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public announcement
or statement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that either Parent or the Company may, without the prior consent of
the other party hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement as may be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq, in the case of Parent, and NYSE Alternext US, Inc., in
the case of the Company, if such party first notifies and (if practicable)
consults with the other regarding the timing and substance of such public
announcement or statement.

Subsidiaries is a party that Parent shall reasonably request in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that, in the event that the other parties to
any such Contract, including any lessor or licensor of any Leased Real
Property, conditions its grant of a consent, waiver or approval (including by
threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon the
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration,
including increased rent payments or other payments under the Contract, the
Company shall not make or commit to make any such payment or provide any such
consideration without Parent's prior written consent;

 

 

(iii) making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and obtaining all necessary actions
or non-actions, waivers, clearances, consents, approvals, orders and

otherwise contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that
may be brought in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) agree to any divesture by itself or any of its Affiliates
of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their

the extent required by applicable Laws and Orders, as promptly as practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall make or submit all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, file or submit all documentation, and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all clearances,
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities, in each case that are necessary or advisable to

documentation and information relating to the other party and any of its
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any application, notice, petition,
filing and documentation made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions

the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose clearance, consent or
approval is required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any clearance, consent or approval required in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
be obtained or that the receipt of any such clearance, consent or approval
will be materially delayed or conditioned.

 

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making and submitting the applications,
notices, petitions and filings contemplated by this Section 5.8, (ii)
subject to applicable Laws and Orders, supply the other with any information
that may be required in order to effectuate such applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and (iii) supply any additional information that may
be required or reasonably requested by any Governmental Entity in connection
with such applications, notices, petitions and filings. Subject to applicable
Laws and Orders, each party hereto shall (w) promptly inform the other party
hereto of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) permit the other
party hereto the opportunity to review in advance all the information
relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any application, notice, petition or
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (y) not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation, or inquiry
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby unless and until such party
has consulted with the other party, and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend such
meeting or discussion, and (z) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and written communications between them and their
Subsidiaries and representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

 

 

5.9   Anti-Takeover Laws. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company, Parent and Sub, at the direction of its respective Board of
Directors, shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with

of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Registration Statement").
The Registration Statement shall include (i) a prospectus for the issuance
of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and (ii) a proxy statement
of the Company for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies for
the Merger Proposal to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting (as

information regarding the Company and the terms of the Merger and this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing with
the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its respective representatives to,
fully cooperate with the other party hereto and its respective
representatives in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party hereto with all
information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other party hereto may
deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation
of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any
amendment or supplement thereto, and each of Parent and the Company shall
provide the other party hereto with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement

Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 

 

(b) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company
Board Recommendation.

 

 

(c)   Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or as may be required
by applicable Law or Order, neither Parent nor the Company shall effect any
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that the Company, in connection
with a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 5.2, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant
to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such change, and in such event, the right
of approval set forth in this Section 5.10(c) shall apply only with respect
to such information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the Company's
right to have the deliberations and conclusions of the Company Board
accurately described. A "Qualifying Amendment" means an amendment or
supplement to the proxy statement for the Company if and solely to the extent
that it contains (i) a Company Board Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement
of the reasons of the Company Board for making such Company Board
Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information reasonably related to
the foregoing.

comply in all material respects as to form and substance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by
any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by any party
hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, or
at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of either party hereto for
inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the
Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a "Regulation
M-A Filing") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing is
filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall notify
each other in writing as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that should be described in an amendment of, or
supplement to, the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, and as promptly as practicable thereafter, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law or
the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. Parent
and the Company shall each notify the other as promptly as practicable after
the receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on,
or of any written or oral request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to, the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of
all correspondence between it or any of its representatives and the SEC or
its staff with respect to any of the foregoing filings. Prior to filing the
Registration Statement or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
Company Stockholders (or filing or mailing any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto or any other materials to be submitted to the
Company Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their approval of
the Merger and this Agreement), each of Parent and the Company, as the case
may be, (i) shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably and timely proposed by such
other party and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the
SEC prior to receiving such other party's approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

(e) Parent and the Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under any
applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection with
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger.

as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause each current employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and each former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case, who is listed on Section 5.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule, to have entered into and executed, and each person who becomes an
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing shall be required by the Company to enter into and
execute, an employee proprietary information agreement with the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent
effective as of such employee's first date of employment or service. Except
as set forth in Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause each current consultant or contractor of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each former consultant or contractor of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, who is listed on Section 5.11
of the Disclosure Schedule, if any, to have entered into and executed, and
each Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of the Company or any
Subsidiary after the date hereof and prior to the Closing shall be required
by the Company to enter into and execute, a consultant proprietary
information agreement with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, in a
form satisfactory to Parent effective as of such consultant or contractor's
first date of service.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-49-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.12   Resignation of Officers and Directors. Upon the request of Parent
delivered to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
executive officer and director of the Company and its Subsidiaries to execute
a resignation letter in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, effective as
of the Effective Time.

 

 

5.13   Termination of 401(k) Plan. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company within ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless
Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board, or such ERISA
Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall
take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of a
401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees, then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than fifteen (15)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

5.14   Continuation of Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) As of and for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, Parent will, or Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, either (i) continue certain Company Employee Plans as
determined in Parent's sole and absolute discretion, (ii) permit employees of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries following the
Closing Date ("Continuing Employees") while they remain so employed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, and, as
applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit
plans, programs or policies (including any plan intended to qualify within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any severance, vacation, sick,
personal time off plans or programs and excluding any equity compensation
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements) of Parent or its Affiliates on
terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Continuing Employees
than those provided during such period to employees of Parent or its
Affiliates who are similarly situated with such Continuing Employees
following the Closing, or (iii) as determined in Parent's sole and absolute
discretion, a combination of clauses (i) and (ii). To the extent Parent
elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate
in its or its Affiliates' employee benefit plans, program or policies
following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, recognize the prior service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including prior service with predecessor
employers where such prior service is recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing, of each
Continuing Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs
or policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and determination of level of benefits (but not (1) for purposes of vesting
any newly granted stock options and any newly granted equity awards, (2)
for the purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan
or (3) to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication
of benefits). From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, (x) cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to such
preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility waiting periods under
the comparable Company Employee Plans as of the time immediately preceding
the Closing, and (y) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
deductibles paid under any Company Employee Plan that provides group health
plan benefits in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under any group
health plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries that
such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing to the same
extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable Company
Employee Plan.

(b) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.14 are
not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any
Company Employee Plan to reflect the terms of this Section 5.14.

 

 

5.15   Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) Subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) fulfill and honor all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") acting in such capacities as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement (to the extent that copies have been made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement), and cause such rights to survive
the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, (ii) for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of current and
former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the Charter Documents, and (iii) for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any person benefitted by such provisions.

 

 

(b) Without limiting Section 5.15(a), for six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide officers' and
directors' liability insurance from a reputable and financially sound carrier
in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that, in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 5.15(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay an aggregate annual premium in excess of 200% of the amount
per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the "Maximum
Premium"), which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement; provided further, however, that if such coverage cannot
be obtained, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Premium, Parent shall provide directors' and officers' liability
insurance that provides, in Parent's reasonable judgment, the Indemnified
Persons the most advantageous policy limits and terms obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation may, and, if so directed by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, purchase a prepaid
"tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, covering the same
persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and amount as
aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth
annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such
insurance, Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 5.15(b) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-51-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.15 shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.15.

 

 

5.16  Section 16 Resolutions. The Board of Directors of Parent, or a
committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution prior to the Effective Time providing that the receipt by Company
Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options, pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended to be exempt from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
thereunder. In addition, the Company Board, or a committee thereof consisting
of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution prior
to the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of
Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options in exchange
for shares of Parent Common Stock are also intended to be exempt from Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder. For
purposes of this Agreement, and the term "Company Insiders" shall mean those
directors and officers of the Company who are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

 

 

5.17   Obligations of the Sub. Parent shall cause Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 

 

5.18   Tax Matters. None of Parent, Sub or the Company shall, and they shall
not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to
or following the Effective Time that would reasonably be expected to cause
the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinions described in Section
6.1(d) (collectively, the "Tax Opinions"). In furtherance of the preceding
sentence, in the event that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock would exceed 20% of the sum of
such cash plus the aggregate value of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger to Company Stockholders, calculated based on the closing price of
one share of Parent Common Stock on the last Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, then immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to merge with and into a
Delaware limited liability company that is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the "Second Step Merger"), with such limited liability company
continuing as the surviving entity of the Second Step Merger. In such event,
any reference to the Merger in this Section 5.18, Recital B or Section 6.1(d)
of this Agreement shall be to the Merger described in Section 1.1 taken
together with the Second Step Merger as part of one integrated transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Officers of Parent, Sub and the Company
shall execute and deliver to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to Parent, and Hogan and Hartson LLP, counsel to the
Company, certificates containing customary representations as described in
Section 6.1(d) at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such
law firms, including the effective date of the Registration Statement and the
Effective Time, in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions
with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger. Each of Parent, Sub and the
Company covenants and agrees to report the Merger for U.S. federal and
applicable state income tax purposes in a manner consistent with the
characterization of the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368(a)(1) of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

taxation), each dated as of the Effective Time and each to the effect that
the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section

(c) Enforcement. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and hereby
agrees that the provisions of Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without such
provisions, neither Parent nor the Company would have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay in a timely
manner any amounts due and payable pursuant to Section 7.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent shall make a claim against the Company and such
claim results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay
to Parent an amount in cash equal to Parent's costs and expenses (including
its attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such claim,
together with interest at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase and Co. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. In the event Parent shall
receive the Termination Fee Amount, the Company shall have no further
liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (provided that nothing herein shall release any party from liability
for intentional breach or fraud). The parties acknowledge and agree that in
no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee Amount on
more than one occasion.

 

 

7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Laws and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Sub and the Company; provided, however, that in the event that this
Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with the
DGCL, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval
of such Company Stockholders without such approval.

 

 

7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

8.2 Interpretation. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall
be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "hereof", "hereby", "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
assigns and successors.

 

 

8.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. A facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement may
be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party by
facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the
signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Such execution and
delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.
At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute and
deliver an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile, telecopy or
other reproduction hereof.

 

 

8.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced
herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; provided, however, that the Confidential Disclosure Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this Section 8.4 shall be null and void.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-61-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.5 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in or contemplated by the
provisions of Section 5.15, this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not,
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

8.6 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company, Parent, Sub and their respective Subsidiaries
contained in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time.

 

 

8.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force
and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons
or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

 

8.8 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

 

8.9 Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any
court of the United States located in the State of Delaware in connection
with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, agrees that process may be served upon them
in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such
persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which
they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and process. Each party
hereto hereby agrees not to commence any legal proceedings relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
jurisdiction or courts other than as provided herein.

 

 

8.10 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefor, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

 

8.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity, the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-62-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
