 (b) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall be an amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price 

   

 _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable, 

    

 (i) Working Capital to the extent it exceeds (in which case, the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased) or to the extent it is less than (in which case, the Initial Purchase Price shall be decreased) US $56,000,000 (" _Target Working Capital_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no such increase or decrease unless Working Capital exceeds or is less than, as the case may be, Target Working Capital by more than US $1,000,000, in which case the adjustment required by this clause (i) shall be made on a dollar-for-dollar basis from the first dollar;

of (i) Working Capital, (ii) any Additional Adjustment Amount and (iii) the
Final Purchase Price, in each case as if the Closing Date had been August 31,

 (c) In determining the Final Purchase Price, to the extent any components or amounts are not reflected in U.S. dollars, the "spot" or currency market exchange rates as of the date two (2) business days before the Closing Date will be utilized. 

   

 SECTION 1.3 _Final Purchase Price and Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_. Subsequent to the Closing, (i) the Company shall be obligated to make a payment to Lonza America (for itself and as agent for the other Purchasers) to the extent that the Final Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.4_ is less than the Initial Purchase Price or (ii) Purchasers shall be obligated to make a payment to the Company (for itself and as agent for the other Sellers) to the extent the Final Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.4_ exceeds the Initial Purchase Price.

     ##### 

  

    

Closing Date. The physical count of such Inventory shall be observed and
confirmed by the Company and its Representatives. The results of the physical
count of the Inventory, which shall take into account changes in Inventory
between the Closing Date and the date on which such physical count
is completed, shall be used to prepare the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule
pursuant to paragraph (b) below. 

   

 (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall prepare and deliver to the Company a post-Closing purchase price adjustment schedule (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Purchasers good faith determination of (i) Working Capital, (ii) any Additional Adjustment Amount and (iii) the Final Purchase Price, in each case as of the Closing Date and determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company shall give Purchasers and their Representatives (including their advisors and accountants) such assistance and access to the assets and books and records and relevant personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Purchasers may reasonably request during normal business hours in order to enable Purchasers to prepare the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule. Following delivery of the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule, Purchasers shall give the Company and its Representatives (including its advisors and accountants) such assistance and access to the assets and books and records and relevant personnel of Purchasers and the Bio Companies as the Company may reasonably request during normal business hours in order to enable the Company to analyze the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule. 

   

 (c) The Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule shall be final and binding on the parties unless the Company shall, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule, deliver to Purchasers written notice of objection (the " _Objection Notice_ ") with respect to the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule. The Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail each disputed item on the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and describe in reasonable detail the basis for each Disputed Item, including the data that forms the basis thereof, as well as the amount in dispute. Notwithstanding the delivery of an Objection Notice, the Post-Closing Adjustment Schedule shall be final and binding to the extent any item is not a Disputed Item.

 SECTION 4.19 _Termination of Rights; Assignment of Certain Agreements and Rights_. 

   

 (a) The Sellers agree that, effective as of the Closing, all rights of any of the Sellers and any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to directors and officers indemnification by or from any of the Bio Companies (whether by contract, by-law, Law or otherwise) shall be terminated, void or of no effect and unenforceable by them. 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to transfer and assign to a Bio Company all of their right, title and interest in and to all of the prior acquisition and indemnity agreements relating to any of the Bio Companies that provide for continuing or available indemnities or payments to or for the benefit of the Bio Companies Business as of the Closing Date, to the extent relating to the Bio Companies Business. 

   

 (c) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to transfer and assign to Purchasers or a Bio Company (other than CBM Intellectual Property) all of the Sellers right, title and interest in and to any and all (i) NDAs that provide for continuing or available confidentiality protection for the benefit of, or related to the confidential information of, the Bio Companies or the Bio Companies Business as of or following the Closing Date and (ii) written non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or similar protective covenants or agreements to which any Seller, any Subsidiary of any Seller (excluding the Bio Companies) or any of their respective officers or employees (or former officers or employees) is a party, in each case to the extent such NDA, covenant or agreement relates to or was entered into for the benefit of the Bio Companies or the Bio Companies Business. To the extent any such NDA, covenant or agreement has not been (or under the terms of such NDA, covenant or agreement cannot by its terms be) assigned to Purchasers or a Bio Company, the Company and the other Sellers shall, from and after the date of this Agreement, perform and fully enforce (including not agreeing to any modification, amendment or waiver) and take all actions as may be reasonably requested by Purchasers to prevent the violation or breach by any other party of any such NDA or covenant or 

      ##### 

  

    

agreement; _provided_ that Purchasers shall reimburse the Company and the
other Sellers for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of any counsel fees and
travel and other expenses incurred, after consultation with Purchasers,
in connection with their taking any such action. 

   

 SECTION 4.20 _Non-Competition_. During the Restricted Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, engage directly or indirectly in any business that competes, directly or indirectly, with the business conducted by the Bio Companies as of the Closing Date in any geographic area in which the Bio Companies conduct that business as of the Closing Date (a " _Competing Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no owner of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any publicly-traded corporation shall be deemed to engage solely by reason thereof in a Competing Business; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the provisions of this Section shall not (a) be applicable to any bona fide third party purchaser who acquires all or any substantial portion of the stock or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether by means of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction, or (b) prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from acquiring any business if less than 10% of the revenues of such business for its most recently completed fiscal year are attributable to a Competing Business; _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that in each such case the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, provide such third party purchaser or the employees associated with such business with any confidential information of the Bio Companies or the Bio Companies Business. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. 

   

 SECTION 4.21 _Non-Solicitation of Customers and Employees_. During the Restricted Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, recruit, solicit or otherwise induce or influence any proprietor, partner, lender, sales agent, joint venturer, investor, lessor, customer, supplier, agent or representative which has a material business relationship with any of the Bio Companies to discontinue, reduce or modify such business relationship with any of the Bio Companies, or (ii) employ or seek to employ any employee of any of the Bio Companies who is then (or was at any time within twelve (12) months prior to the date the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates employs or seeks to employ such former employee of the Bio Companies) employed or retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates unless such Transferred Bio Companies Employee has been terminated by Purchasers or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing herein shall prevent the Company and its Subsidiaries from providing a letter of recommendation to an employee or other Person with respect to a future employment opportunity and (b) this Section shall not apply to general solicitations of employment not specifically directed towards employees of the Bio Companies; _provided_ that the provisions of this _Section 4.21_ shall not be applicable to any bona fide third party purchaser who acquires all or any substantial portion of the stock or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether by means of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, 

      ##### 

  

    

business combination or similar transaction; _provided_ _further_ , _however_
, that in each such case the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, provide such third party purchaser with any confidential

The Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes attributable to the Tax periods for which the Tax Returns referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above are filed. Within 120 days after the Closing Date (or sooner if reasonably requested by the Company to timely file a Tax Return), Purchasers shall cause each of the Bio Companies included in a Tax Return described in clause (A) or 

    ##### 

  

    

(B) above to prepare and provide to the Company a package of Tax information
materials, including schedules and work papers, required by the Company to
enable the Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns (which have not been
filed on or before the Closing Date) required to be prepared and filed by the
Company pursuant to this paragraph (the " _Tax Package_ "). In addition, on
or before the earlier of the date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date and the fifth (5th) business day after the calendar quarter in which the
Closing occurs, Purchasers shall cause each of the Bio Companies included in
a Tax Return described in clause (A) or (B) above to prepare and provide to
the Company a package of Tax information materials, including schedules and
work papers, required by the Company in connection with the public release of
its results of operations for such quarter in a manner consistent with past
practice. 

    

 (ii) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of or which include any Bio Company, other than Tax Returns described in _Section 6.1(a)(i)_, that are required to be filed (after giving effect to any valid extension of time in which to make such filing) on or prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall cause the Bio Companies to pay all Taxes attributable to the Tax periods for which such Tax Returns are filed. 

   

 (iii) After the Closing, Purchasers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, on behalf of the Bio Companies all other Tax Returns of, or which include, a Bio Company (other than those Tax Returns described in _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ ). Purchasers shall, or shall cause the Bio Companies to, pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes attributable to the Tax periods for which such Tax Returns are filed. 

  

 (b) All Tax Returns described in _Section 6.1(a)_ (including the Tax Package) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless a past practice has been finally determined to be incorrect by the applicable Taxing Authority or a contrary treatment is required by applicable Tax Laws (or the judicial or administrative interpretations thereof). 

   

 (c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or administrative practice of any Taxing Authority, any transactions involving any of the Bio Companies that are not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date but after the Closing, other than any transactions relating to the sale of any Bio Company or any assets thereof to Purchasers or any of Purchasers Affiliates, shall be reported on Purchasers consolidated United States federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or on the post-Closing separate company Tax Returns of the applicable Bio Company (if the applicable Bio Company does not file a consolidated federal income Tax Return with Purchasers), and shall be similarly reported on all other Tax Returns of Purchasers or its Affiliates to the extent permitted. The Sellers, Purchasers and the Bio Companies shall not take any position inconsistent with the preceding sentence on any Tax Return. 

   

 (d) Purchasers and the Company agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and each at its own expense, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanations of any material provided relating to the Bio Companies, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax 

    ##### 

  

    

Returns, for the preparation for any audit and for the prosecution or defense
of any Action or Proceeding relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment
with respect to Taxes. Purchasers shall retain in their possession or cause
the Bio Companies to retain in their possession, and shall provide the
Company reasonable access to (including the right to make copies of),
such supporting books and records and any other materials that the Company
may specify with respect to matters relating to Taxes for any taxable period
ending on or prior to or which includes the Closing Date for a period of
seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such longer period as may
be required by Law. After such time, Purchasers may dispose of such material;
_provided_ , that prior to such disposition Purchasers shall give the Company
a reasonable opportunity at its expense to take possession of such
materials. 

   

 (e) No Purchasers or any Affiliate or successor of any Purchaser shall (or shall cause or permit any of the Bio Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Bio Company with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before December 31, 2005, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 SECTION 6.2 _Certain Other Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be paid 50% by Purchasers and 50% by the Company, and the party obligated under applicable Law to file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees, shall file such Tax Returns or other documentation and, if required by applicable Law, the other party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation and will cooperate with the other party to take such commercially reasonable actions as will minimize or reduce the amount of such Taxes or fees. 

   

 SECTION 6.3 _Tax Audits_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) to represent the interests of the Bio Companies in and control the conduct of any audit or administrative or court Action or Proceeding, with the participation of Purchasers at Purchasers expense, relating to Taxes described in _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ ") and the Company shall have the right to employ counsel of its choice at its expense in the conduct of any such contest. Purchasers will reasonably cooperate, and shall cause the Bio Companies to reasonably cooperate, at the Companys expense, with the Company and its counsel in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any said Action or Proceeding. If the Company does not elect to control a Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section 6.3(a)_ that relates to a separate company Tax of a Bio Company and not a Tax relating to a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes the Company or a non-Bio Company Subsidiary of the Company, Purchasers or the Bio Companies may, without affecting its or any other indemnified partys rights to indemnification under this  _Article VI_, assume and control the defense of such Tax Claim with participation by the Company (at the Companys expense). 

   

 (b) If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes any Taxes for which the Company may have an indemnity obligation pursuant to 

     ##### 

  

    

 _Section 6.4(a)_, Purchasers shall, promptly upon receipt by Purchasers
and/or the Bio Companies of notice thereof, inform the Company thereof. The
failure of Purchasers or the Bio Companies to timely forward
such notification in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall
not relieve the Company of any indemnity obligation it may have pursuant to
_Section 6.4(a)_ except and to the extent that the failure to timely forward
such notification actually prejudices the ability of the Company to contest
such liability for Taxes or increases the amount of such Taxes. 

   

 (c) The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to jointly represent the interests of any Bio Company with Purchasers in any audit or administrative or court Action or Proceeding relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period. Any disputes regarding the conduct or resolution of any such audit or proceeding shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 6.5_. 

   

 (d) Purchasers shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Bio Companies in all audits or administrative or court Actions or Proceedings relating to Taxes other than those specified in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _(c)_. 

   

 (e) The Company, on the one hand, and Purchasers and/or the Bio Companies, on the other hand, shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or Action or Proceeding which would adversely affect the other party without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 SECTION 6.4 _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) After the Closing Date, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers and the Bio Companies from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, losses, damages, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs (" _Tax Losses_ ") resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any Taxes that the Company is responsible to pay pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ or _(ii)_ , (ii) Taxes of any Bio Company with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (iii) the Companys share of Taxes payable pursuant to _Section 6.2_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be liable pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ to the extent of Taxes with respect to which a liability was recorded on the Bioproducts Balance Sheet or Biopharma Balance Sheet made available pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ and Tax liabilities taken into account in determining Working Capital for purposes of _Article I_ of this Agreement, (iv) any liability for Taxes resulting directly from making any Section 338 Election, provided such election is made in accordance with _Section 6.7_, and (v) any liability for Taxes (other than Taxes described in _Section 6.2_ of this Agreement) imposed on any Bio Company arising a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The indemnity provided in the foregoing sentence shall include, without limitation, any Tax liability arising by reason of any Bio Company being severally liable for any Taxes of another Person pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign Tax provision, as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, the Companys obligation to indemnify Purchasers pursuant to this _Section 6.4(a)_ is unconditional and not subject to any limitation on the Companys obligations pursuant to _Article IX_ or any other provision of this Agreement. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) After the Closing Date, Purchasers shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates from and against any and all Tax Losses arising out of or relating to (i) any Taxes of the Bio Companies (including Purchasers shares of Taxes payable pursuant to _Section 6.2_) other than amounts for which the Company has an indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 6.4(a) _and (ii) any Taxes resulting from Purchasers breach of _Section 6.7(a)_. 

   

 (c) For purposes of _Sections 6.4(a)_ and _(b)_ , whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes in the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of the Company and its Subsidiaries allocable to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of the parties under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. 

   

 SECTION 6.5 _Dispute Resolution_. In the event that the Company or any Purchaser disputes the application or interpretation of any provision of _Sections 6.1_ through  _6.3_ , or the amount or calculation of Taxes, if any, owed by such party thereunder, such party shall deliver to the other a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute within twenty (20) days following the date of the statement provided pursuant to the preceding sentence. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within such twenty (20) day period, the dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall finally and conclusively resolve any dispute relating to matters set forth in this _Section 6.5_ within thirty (30) days following receipt of the submission. The Independent Accountants shall determine, only with respect to the specific disagreements submitted in writing by the Company and the applicable Purchaser, the manner in which such item or items in dispute should be resolved; _provided_ , _however_ , that the dollar amount of any such item or items shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts proposed by the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. Any finding by the Independent Accountants shall be a reasoned award stating the findings of fact and conclusions of Law (if any) on which it is based, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding the disputed items so presented. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be shared by the Company and the applicable Purchaser in proportion to each partys respective liability for Taxes which are the subject of the dispute as determined by the 

     ##### 

  

    

Independent Accountants, and the parties shall otherwise bear their own
expenses incurred in any dispute resolution pursuant to this Section. 

   

 SECTION 6.6 _Refunds_. 

   

 (a) Any refunds (including but not limited to any refunds related to the U.K. Group Relief process) of Taxes (together with any interest received with respect thereto) paid to or in respect of the Bio Companies (including any amounts credited against income Tax to which any Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Bio Companies becomes entitled) and that relate to Taxes for which the Company is responsible pursuant to this Article VI shall be for the account of the Company. A Purchaser shall pay over to the Company any such refund or the amount of any such credit (in each case, together with any interest received with respect thereto) within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. The preceding sentences shall not apply to any refunds or credits to the extent such refunds or credits are (i) reflected as an asset on the Bioproducts Balance Sheet or the Biopharma Balance Sheet or (ii) reflected as an asset in determining Working Capital for purposes of _Section 1.2_ of this Agreement, in each case, all of which refunds or credits shall be for the account of the applicable Purchaser. 

   

 (b) Purchasers shall, if the Company so requests and at the Companys expense, prepare, execute and file any claims for refunds or credits, or cause the Bio Companies to prepare, execute and file any claims for refunds or credits, to which the Company is entitled under this Section. Purchasers shall permit the Company to control the prosecution of any such refund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers shall have no obligations under this _Section 6.6(b)_ to the extent Purchasers reasonably determine that fulfilling their obligations described herein would have a material adverse effect on Purchasers with respect to any taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date. 

   

 SECTION 6.7 _Certain Elections and Other Tax Matters_. 

   

 (a) Upon the mutual agreement of the Company and Lonza America (for itself and on behalf of the other Purchasers), the Company and Purchasers shall make or join in making any elections under Section 338 of the Code (and any comparable election under any relevant state or local Law) (a " _Section 338 Election_") with respect to the purchase and sale of any of the Bio Companies under this Agreement. In no event shall either party make a Section 338 Election with respect to any Bio Company without the prior written consent of the other party. If either party desires to make one or more Section 338 Elections, it shall notify the other party in writing of such decision within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. If such other party agrees to make the Section 338 Election, the party proposing the Section 338 Election shall propose an allocation of the Final Purchase Price (which, for this purpose, shall include any Bio Company liabilities properly taken into account for purposes of determining the purchase price under Code Section 338) among the assets of the applicable Bio Company in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate), and shall notify the other party in writing of such proposed Final Purchase Price allocation within fifteen (15) days following receipt of the other partys written consent to the making of such Section 338 Election. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to agree on an allocation of the Final Purchase Price and, once agreed to, the allocation shall be binding on the parties (the " _Allocation_ "). If the parties 

     ##### 

  

    

cannot agree upon the Allocation within thirty (30) days following the
delivery of the proposed allocation then no such Section 338 Election
shall be made. Purchasers and the Company shall report and file Tax Returns
(including but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 if
applicable) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Allocation. Neither Purchasers nor the Company shall take any
position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the Allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law. Within 180
days following the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchasers IRS Form
8023 (or applicable successor form) for each Bio Company for which a Code
Section 338(h)(10) election is made, fully executed by the Company or other
applicable sellers pursuant to the requirements stated therein. 

   

 (b) Purchasers shall not permit the Bio Companies to carry back any loss, deduction or credit to any taxable period that ends on, prior to or which includes the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) It is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this  _Article VI_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly. 

   

 (d) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchasers a schedule setting forth the allocation of the Final Purchase Price among the Bio Companies. If any Purchaser disagrees with the allocation of the Final Purchase Price among the Bio Companies, such Purchaser shall notify the Company of such disagreement and its reasons for so disagreeing, in which case the Company and Purchasers shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the disagreement. To the extent the Company and Purchasers cannot agree on a mutually acceptable determination and/or allocation of the Final Purchase Price, such determination and/or allocation shall be made by each of Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, in connection with their respective U.S. federal, state, and local tax returns and other filings, and each such Person shall report the allocation of the Final Purchase Price among the Bio Companies as such party acting in good faith deems appropriate. 

   

 (e) If the transfer of any Bio Company is treated as an "applicable asset acquisition" within the meaning of Code Section 1060 (other than any such transfer for which a Section 338 Election is made, the allocation for which shall be governed by _Section 6.7(a)_ hereof) and the Company and Purchasers have agreed on an allocation of the Final Purchase Price to the interests in such Bio Company pursuant to 
  _Section 6.7(d)_, then, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall deliver to the Company a schedule allocating the portion of
the Final Purchase Price allocable to each Bio Company the sale of which is
treated as an applicable asset acquisition (such portion determined pursuant
to _Section 6.7(d)_ and increased to take into account any Bio Company
liabilities properly included therein) among the assets of the applicable Bio
Company in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law, as appropriate). If the Company disagrees with any items reflected on
the schedule so provided, the Company shall notify Purchasers of such
disagreement and its reasons for so disagreeing, in which case the Company
and Purchasers shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the disagreement. To
the extent the Company and Purchasers cannot agree on the contents of the 

       ##### 

  

    

schedule delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.7(e)_ , each of the Company
and Purchasers shall be free to use their own allocation schedule in
preparing their respective U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns
and other filings. If the parties are able to agree on an allocation for
purposes of this _Section 6.7(e)_, Purchasers and the Company shall report
and file Tax Returns (including but not limited to Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 if applicable) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with
the allocation and neither Purchasers nor the Company shall take any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law. To the extent
consistent with the foregoing, any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price

 SECTION 6.9 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Anything in any other agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all liabilities and obligations between Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Bio Companies, on the other hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement in effect prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and terminate as of the Closing Date and the Bio Companies shall have no liability or obligation thereunder after the Closing Date. 

   

ARTICLE VII 

   

EMPLOYEE AND BENEFITS MATTERS  

  

 SECTION 7.1 _Transferred Bio Companies Employees_. 

   

 (a) _Continued Employment_. The Bio Companies shall continue to employ immediately following the Closing each of the individuals employed by the Bio Companies immediately prior to the Closing , including, without limitation, any individual on leave or short-term or long-term disability (each such employee being hereafter referred to as a " _Transferred Bio Companies Employee_ "). No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as limiting the ability of Purchasers to terminate the employment of any Transferred Bio Companies Employee at any time following the Closing for any reason, nor shall they be construed to create any contractual rights between any Transferred Bio Companies Employee and Purchasers. 

   

 (b) _Continued Compensation and Benefits_. Without limiting any of the obligations of Purchasers set forth in this _Article VII_ and subject to _Section 7.2(a)_, effective as of the Closing, Purchasers shall continue or establish, or cause to be continued or established, employee compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (including fringe benefits and severance pay) that will provide benefits and compensation to the Transferred Bio Companies Employees (and, if applicable, their eligible beneficiaries) for a period of at least one (1) year after the Closing (or such longer period as may be required by applicable Law) that are at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the Bio Companies) to the Transferred Bio Companies Employees (and, 

     ##### 

  

    

if applicable, their eligible beneficiaries) immediately prior to the
Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates shall (i) honor all employment, severance, retention and change-
in-control agreements by and between the Company or its Subsidiaries and
any Transferred Bio Companies Employee or any Former Bio Companies Employee,
which agreements shall be assigned to, and assumed by, Purchasers or a Bio
Company on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) for the longer of one (1) year
following the Closing and the period during which such benefits are required
to be provided by the terms of any applicable Company Plan, continue to
maintain for each Transferred Bio Companies Employee the severance
arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Bio Companies) for each such Transferred Bio Companies Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) assume and perform the obligations
of the Company with respect to Transferred Bio Companies Employees and Former
Bio Companies Employees under The Cambrex Corporation 2004 Incentive Plan in
accordance with the terms of such plan as in effect on the date hereof. 

   

 (c) _Service Crediting, Etc_. For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits (but not benefit accrual under pension or similar plans and not for purposes of eligibility for any post-retirement medical benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Purchasers and their respective Affiliates which provide benefits to any Transferred Bio Companies Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Bio Companies Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the Bio Companies) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Transferred Bio Companies Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under the corresponding Bio Companies Plan in which such Transferred Bio Companies Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that prior service with a Purchaser and its Affiliates is not provided under such Purchaser Plan for similarly situated employees of Purchasers and its Affiliates who is not a Transferred Bio Companies Employee. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to the consent of any applicable insurer or other service provider with respect to a New Plan: (i) each Transferred Bio Companies Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA) to the extent that the Transferred Bio Companies Employee had satisfied the waiting period under a corresponding Bio Companies Plan in which such Transferred Bio Companies Employee participated immediately before the Closing and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Bio Companies Employee, a Purchaser or its Affiliates shall cause (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the corresponding Bio Companies Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (y) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the applicable Bio Companies Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

     ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 7.2 _Treatment of Certain Plans and Coverages_. 

   

 (a) _Company Pension Plans_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Article VII_, but subject to _Section 7.3(a)_, neither Purchasers nor any of the Bio Companies shall have any responsibility for, or liability under or with respect to, The Retirement Plan for Employees of Cambrex Corporation, The Cambrex Corporation Savings Plan, The Cambrex Retiree Medical Plan or the Cambrex Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the " _Company Pension Plans_ "), and the Company Pension Plans shall each retain all assets and liabilities related to Transferred Bio Companies Employees and Former Bio Companies Employees accrued thereunder. Each Purchaser, its Affiliates and their assigns shall cooperate with the Company and its successors and assigns in connection with administering the benefits accrued by Transferred Bio Companies Employees and Former Bio Companies Employees under the Company Pension Plans and to promptly provide all documentation, information and assistance reasonably requested by the Company, its successors and assigns or the administrator of the Company Pension Plans in respect of the administration and or distribution of such benefits. The Company and its Affiliates (other than the Bio Companies) shall indemnify and hold Purchasers and the Bio Companies and their respective Affiliates harmless against all Liabilities related to the Company Pension Plans, regardless of when such Liabilities arise. 

   

 (b) _Bio Companies Pension Plans_. Subject to _Section 7.2(a)_, each deferred compensation, pension, retirement or other similar plan that covers or provides benefits solely to Transferred Bio Companies Employees and/or Former Bio Companies Employees, including, without limitation, the BioWhittaker, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the " _Bio Companies SERP_ ") and the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the " _Bio Companies Stand-Alone Pension Plans_ "), shall be sponsored by a Bio Company as of the Closing (and any associated insurance and service provider agreements shall have been assumed by a Bio Company as of the Closing), and the Company shall have caused to be transferred to the applicable Bio Companies sponsorship of any trust established to fund any Bio Companies Stand-Alone Pension Plan. The Company, its Affiliates and their assigns shall provide reasonable cooperation to Purchasers, the Bio Companies and their successors and assigns in connection with administering the Bio Companies Stand-Alone Pension Plans and shall as soon as reasonably practicable provide all documentation, information and assistance reasonably requested by Purchasers, the Bio Companies, their successors and assigns or the administrator of the Bio Companies Stand-Alone Pension Plans in respect of the administration of and/or distribution of benefits from such plans. Purchasers and the Bio Companies shall (i) within thirty (30) days following the Closing, make any contribution required to be made pursuant to section 4.4 of the Bio Companies SERP and (ii) indemnify and hold the Company and its Affiliates harmless against all Liabilities related to the Bio Companies Stand-Alone Pension Plans, regardless of when such Liabilities arise. 

   

 (c) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Purchasers or an Affiliate of Purchasers shall establish flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or maintained under Section 125 or Section 129 of the Code, as applicable (" _Purchasers FSAs_ "), effective as of the Closing Date, for each Transferred Bio Companies Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is a participant in a flexible spending account 

      ##### 

  

    

for medical or dependent care expenses under a Bio Companies Plan pursuant to
Section 125 or Section 129 of the Code (" _Company FSAs_ "). As soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide an accounting to Purchasers of each applicable Transferred Bio
Companies Employees account balance in Company FSAs, in each case as of the
Closing Date. Upon receipt of such accounting, Purchasers shall cause each
participating Transferred Bio Companies Employees account under Purchasers
FSAs to be credited or debited, as applicable, effective on the day after the
Closing Date, in an amount equal to the applicable account balance of such
Transferred Bio Companies Employee under the corresponding Company FSA as of
the Closing Date. As soon as administratively practicable after the delivery
of the accounting described above, the Company shall transfer to Purchasers
an amount equal to the total contributions made to Company FSAs
by Transferred Bio Companies Employees in respect of the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, reduced by an amount equal to the total claims
already paid to Transferred Bio Companies Employees under such plans in
respect of such plan year; _provided_ that if such amount is a
negative number, Purchasers shall transfer to the Company, within thirty (30)
days following the Companys request, an amount equal to the aggregate
deficit balance in such accounts. Purchasers and the Company intend that the
actions to be taken pursuant to this Section be treated as an assumption
by Purchasers of the portion of Company FSAs and the elections made
thereunder attributable to the participating Transferred Bio Companies
Employees. 

   

 (d) _COBRA Coverage_. Purchasers shall, commencing on the Closing Date, provide group health plan continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, " _COBRA Coverage_ ") to each Transferred Bio Companies Employee (and such employees eligible dependents) who is receiving, or is eligible to receive, COBRA Coverage on the Closing or becomes eligible for COBRA Coverage following the Closing.

Purchasers and the Bio Companies shall assume responsibility for, and shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Affiliates harmless against, all Liabilities related to the obligation to provide any post-termination welfare benefits (including, without limitation, long-term disability and post-retirement medical, dental, vision, pharmacy and life insurance benefits) under the Cambrex Retiree Medical Plan to any eligible Transferred Bio Companies Employee or Former Bio Companies Employee at the Rockland facility (and, if applicable, his or her eligible beneficiaries) who has satisfied the eligibility conditions for such benefits as of the Closing and who elects such coverage within thirty (30) days following the Closing. 

   

 (b) _Other Liabilities_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ , Purchasers and the Bio Companies shall assume, discharge, pay and be solely liable for, and shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from and against, any and all Losses related to Transferred Bio Companies Employees or Former Bio Companies Employees including, without limitation, (i) any earned and unused vacation, holiday pay or other fringe benefits, (ii) any health, accidental death and dismemberment, disability or life insurance coverage and any health and welfare benefits under the Bio Companies Plans, (iii) any

severance pay, salary continuation, retention or other special bonuses or
like compensation payable under the Bio Companies Plans, including without
limitation, to the extent not paid prior to Closing, accrued bonuses payable
on a discretionary basis to employees of the Biopharma Companies in an amount
equal to the amounts reserved therefor in the financial statements delivered
by the Company to Purchasers pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_ and (iv) any
other Liability arising out of the employment or termination of employment of
the Transferred Bio Companies Employees or Former Bio Companies Employees, in
each case whether such Losses relate to or arise out of events, occurrences,
actions, omissions, facts or circumstances occurring, existing or asserted
before, on or after the Closing Date. Purchasers shall make all necessary
arrangements to assume all workers compensation claim files, whether open or
closed, as of the Closing Date, and will make the necessary arrangements for
assuming the continued management of such liabilities, including through
providing to the Company at Closing a letter of credit in favor of the
Company. 

   

 SECTION 7.4 _No Plan Amendments; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Non-US Law_. 

   

 (a) No provision of this Agreement is intended to be, and shall not be construed as, an amendment of an employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement nor shall any provision of this Agreement be interpreted to modify, waive or supplement the provisions of any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement. 

   

 (b) It is understood and agreed between the parties that all provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and do not and shall not create any right in any other person, including, but not limited to, any Transferred Bio Companies Employees or Former Bio Companies Employee, any participant in any benefit or compensation plan or any beneficiary thereof. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchasers and Sellers shall (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to) take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause the transfer of employment of each Transferred Bio Companies Employee whose employment is governed by a jurisdiction other than the United States from employment with the Seller to employment with Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates) and the Seller and Purchasers agree that all such transfers of employment shall be made in all respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of local Law.

   ##### 

  

   

that address matters only as of a particular date, which shall be true and
correct as of such date), but only to the extent that such failure would
cause the condition contained in _Section 5.2(a)_ not to be satisfied as of
such date and such condition is, as a result of such breach or failure,
incapable of being satisfied on or before the Outside Date; 

   

 (ii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply with any obligation, agreement or covenant required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it, but only to the extent that such breach or failure would cause the condition contained in _Section 5.2(b)_ not to be satisfied as of such date and such condition is, as a result of such breach or failure, incapable of being satisfied on or before the Outside Date;

 (v) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have (A) failed to recommend the Bio Companies Transactions to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement, (B) withdrawn or modified or proposed publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Purchasers its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Bio Companies Transactions, (C) approved or recommended, or proposed publicly to approve or recommend, a Bio Companies Takeover Proposal to the holders of Company Common Stock, (D) caused the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to take any action that would constitute a breach of _Section 4.2_, (E) caused any Seller or Bio Company to enter into a Bio Companies Acquisition Agreement, or (F) resolved to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either party as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than _Sections 4.9_, _8.2_ ,  _8.3_ , _10.1_ , _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.6_ , _10.7_ , _10.8_ ,  _10.9_ , _10.10_ , _10.12_ , the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.7_ and the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement at any time) and there shall be no liability as a result thereof on the part of Purchasers or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (i) the Company may have liability as provided in _Section 8.3_, and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement.

    ##### 

  

        

 (i) within sixteen (16) months after termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, _8.1(b)(iii)_ or _8.1(d)_ the Company shall have consummated an Alternative Bio Companies Takeover Proposal (as defined below); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_;

ARTICLE IX 

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 SECTION 9.1 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Following the Closing, except with respect to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VI)_, employee benefits of or other Liabilities to Transferred Bio Companies Employees and Former Bio Companies Employees (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VII_) and as expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement, the Company and the other Sellers, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchasers, the Bio Companies and each of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, successors and assigns (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of, resulting from or relating to any Company Liability (including, without limitation, arising out of the failure of the Company, the other Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Bio Companies) to pay, perform or otherwise discharge when due any such Company Liability), whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing. 

   

 SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Following the Closing, except with respect to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VI)_, employee benefits of or other Liabilities to Transferred Bio Companies Employees and Former Bio Companies Employees (which shall be governed exclusively by _Article VII_) and as expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Purchasers shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, each Affiliate of the Company and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns (the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Company Indemnitees arising out of, resulting from or relating to any Bio Companies Liability (including, without limitation, arising out of the failure of any Purchaser or any of the Bio Companies to pay, perform or otherwise discharge when due any such Bio Companies Liability), whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing. 

   

 SECTION 9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The amount which any party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") is or may be required to pay to any other party (an " _Indemnitee_ ") pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ shall be reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any Insurance Proceeds or other amount actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, in reduction of the related Loss arising out of a Company Liability or Bio Companies Liability; _provided_ , that no party is required to maintain insurance for such purpose. If an Indemnitee shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss arising out of a Company Liability or Bio Companies Liability and shall subsequently actually receive Insurance Proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Loss arising out of a Company Liability or Bio Companies Liability, then such Indemnitee shall pay to such Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually received (up to but not in excess of the amount of any indemnity payment made hereunder). An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being 

      ##### 

  

    

expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party
shall be entitled to a "windfall" ( _i.e._ , a benefit they would not be
entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. 

   

 SECTION 9.4 _Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. Procedures for indemnification of Third Party Claims shall be as follows: 

   

 (a) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority) who is not a party to this Agreement of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action or Proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall not relieve the related Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this  _Article IX_, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and, if ascertainable, shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. 

   

 (b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend or to seek to settle or compromise, at such Indemnifying Partys own expense and by such Indemnifying Partys own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with  _Section 9.4(a)_ (or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this _Article IX_ for any legal or other expenses (except expenses approved in advance by the Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ that if the defendants in any such claim include both the Indemnifying Party and one or more Indemnitees and in any Indemnitees reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between one or more of such Indemnitees and such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnitees shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent such Indemnitees and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in this 
  _Section 9.4(b)_ , such Indemnitee may defend or (subject to the remainder
of this _Section 9.4(b)_ and _Section 9.4(d)_) seek to compromise or settle
such Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Neither an
Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such Indemnitee, in the case of a consent or settlement by an Indemnifying
Party, or the Indemnifying Party, in the case of a consent or settlement by
the Indemnitee, of a written release from all Liability in respect to
such Third Party Claim. 

      ##### 

  

     

 (c) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, the related Indemnitee shall make available to such Indemnifying Party any personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, settlement or compromise, and shall otherwise cooperate in the defense, settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.4_ to the contrary, neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee may settle or compromise any claim over the objection of the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If an Indemnifying Party notifies the related Indemnitee in writing of such Indemnifying Partys desire to settle or compromise a Third Party Claim on the basis set forth in such notice (provided that such settlement or compromise includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff of a written release of the Indemnitee from all Liability in respect thereof) and the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing that such Indemnitee declines to accept any such settlement or compromise, such Indemnitee may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by such Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnitees sole expense.

Cambrex shall not be obligated to provide any services to Purchasers other than the Transition Services; _provided_ that (i) if any service that Cambrex provided to any of the Bio Companies in the ordinary course of business immediately prior to the date hereof and that is of a transitional nature is inadvertently omitted from the list of Transition Services or (ii) if any Purchaser requires additional services of a transitional nature, then Cambrex and Purchaser agree to negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to include such services (to the extent, and only to the extent, that such services can be provided without resulting in a conflict of interest for Cambrex) in _Annex A_ at a cost to be determined in good faith, using the same methodology as Cambrex used to determine the costs set forth in _Annex A_. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Cambrex to provide priority to

Purchasers with respect to the Transition Services over Cambrexs businesses
or those of any of its Affiliates, Subsidiaries or divisions 

   

 2\. _Billing and Payment_. Cambrex shall issue Purchasers invoices for the Transition Services at the beginning of each month during the Term. Each Purchaser shall promptly pay any bills and invoices that it receives from Cambrex or its Affiliates for the Transition Services. Each Purchaser shall pay interest on any amount overdue under this Agreement at the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the term of this Agreement plus two percent (2%) from the date due until payment, or, if lower, the highest interest rate permitted by Law. All invoices shall be paid by wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by Cambrex (in writing to the applicable Purchaser or Purchasers) not later than ten (10) days following receipt by the applicable Purchaser or Purchasers of Cambrexs invoice, unless such invoice is disputed in good faith within ten (10) days after receipt of such invoice. In the event that any Purchaser fails to make payment to Cambrex within forty-five (45) days following receipt by such Purchaser of Cambrexs invoice (other than any invoice that was timely disputed in good faith), Cambrex may terminate this Agreement upon notice to Purchasers. Purchasers shall not offset any amounts owing to it by Cambrex or any of Cambrexs Affiliates against amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder. 

   

 3\. _General Intent_. Cambrex shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide the Transition Services at the price set forth in 
  _Annex A_ during the Term and such other transition assistance as the
parties may otherwise agree. Each Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to end its need to use such assistance as soon as
reasonably practicable and in all events to end such need with respect to
each Transition Service not later than the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 5_. 

   

 4\. _Walkersville Facility_. In connection with the provision of the Transition Services, during the Term and for thirty (30) days thereafter, Cambrex and its Representatives shall have full physical access to the data center facilities at Walkersville; _provided_  that Cambrex and its employees and Representatives shall comply with all of the security policies and procedures of Purchasers and the Bio Companies. In addition, all Cambrex employees with offices in the Walkersville facility immediately prior to the date hereof who are providing Transition Services to Purchasers shall be permitted to retain their offices in the Walkersville facility during the Term. 

   

 5\. _Term of Agreement_. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof) for a period not to exceed two (2) months (the " _Transition Period_ "). Purchasers may request an extension of the term of any Transition Service set forth in _Annex A_ by submitting a written request to Cambrex to extend the term of such service (the " _Extension Period_ ") thirty (30) days prior to the end of any such service term. Cambrex may continue to provide such Transition Service to Purchasers at the price set forth in _Annex A_ during any Extension Period, and Cambrexs consent to continue providing such service shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement and the obligations of Cambrex to provide any services hereunder shall automatically terminate one (1) year after the date hereof. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6\. _Partial Termination_. Any and all of the Transition Services provided by Cambrex and its Affiliates are only terminable earlier than the period specified in _Annex A_  attached hereto by Purchasers on thirty (30) days prior written notice to Cambrex. As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any such notice, Cambrex shall advise Purchasers as to whether termination of such Transition Service will require the termination or partial termination of, or otherwise affect the provision of, certain other Transition Services. If such is the case, Purchasers may withdraw their termination notice. Otherwise, such termination shall be final. All periodic fees or charges under this Agreement are to be computed on a calendar month basis and, in the event that any Transition Services are terminated pursuant to this Section, the fees or charges shall be prorated on a per diem basis for any partial month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any Extension Period the fees and charges shall not be prorated for any partial period for any reason. 

   

 7\. _Non-Solicitation of Employee_. For a period of two (2) years following the date hereof, neither Purchasers nor any of their respective Affiliates will directly or indirect solicit the employment of any officer or employee of Cambrex or any of its Affiliates so long as they are employed by Cambrex or any of its Affiliates, without obtaining the prior written consent of Cambrex, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit any general solicitation or advertising activities not targeted to any such officer or employee nor apply to any individual whose employment is terminated by Cambrex or any Affiliate of Cambrex. 

   

 8\. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ that such consent shall not be required (i) for assignments and transfers by operation of Law, (ii) in the event Cambrex assigns any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to a Person with whom Cambrex merges or to whom Cambrex sells all or substantially all of its assets and (iii) for assignments and transfers by either party to one or more of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (in the case of Purchasers such Subsidiaries or Affiliates must be Subsidiaries or Affiliates that operate the Bio Companies Business). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and void. 

   

 9\. _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person (other than any such Affiliate or Representative), unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of any Law, all confidential or competitively sensitive information received in connection with the provision of the Transition Services, except to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) in the public domain (either prior to or after the furnishing of such information) through no fault of such party or its Affiliates or its Representatives or (ii) later acquired by such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives from another source if such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives is unaware that such source is under an obligation to the other party to keep such information confidential. This duty shall continue throughout the term of this Agreement, and any renewals or extensions thereof, and after termination thereof for a period of three (3) years. 

    ##### 

  

     

 10\. _Limitation of Liability_. Neither party shall be liable to the other party or any third party for any special, punitive, consequential, incidental or exemplary damages (including lost or anticipated revenues or profits relating to the same) arising from any claim relating to this Agreement or any of the services provided hereunder, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise, even if an authorized representative of such party is advised of the possibility or likelihood of the same. In addition, neither party shall be liable to the other party or any third party for any direct damages from any claim arising or allegedly arising from providing or failing to provide the Transition Services or any other services, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such claims arise from gross negligence, reckless or willful misconduct or fraud. 

   

 11\. _Notices_. All notices, reports, and receipts shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given on (i) the date of personal or courier delivery, (ii) the date of transmission by facsimile or other electronic transmission service, provided a confirmation copy is also sent no later than the next business day by postage paid, return receipt requested first-class mail or (iii) three (3) business days after the date of deposit in the United States mails, by postage paid, return receipt requested first-class mail, addressed as follows:

 12\. _Modification; Nonwaiver_. No alleged waiver, modification or amendment to this Agreement or to _Annex A_ attached hereto shall be effective against either party hereto, unless in writing, signed by the party against which such waiver, modification or amendment is asserted, and referring specifically to the provision hereof alleged to be waived, modified or amended. The failure or delay of either party to insist upon the other partys strict performance of the provisions in this Agreement or to exercise in any respect any right, power, privilege, or remedy provided for under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver or relinquishment thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, privilege, or remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege, or remedy;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations and duties of either party with respect to the performance of any term or condition in this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 

   

 13\. _Relationship of Parties_. Except as specifically provided herein, neither party shall act or represent or hold itself out as having authority to act as an agent or partner of the other party, or in any way bind or commit the other party to any obligations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, trust or other association of any kind, each party being individually responsible only for its obligations as set forth in this Agreement. All activities by Cambrex under the terms of this Agreement shall be carried on by Cambrex as an independent contractor and not as an agent for Purchasers. Employees of Cambrex performing services hereunder shall remain Cambrexs employees and shall not be deemed to be employees of any Purchaser. Except as set forth in _Annex A_ , and except for direct out-of-pocket costs, Cambrex shall pay for all personnel expenses (including, without limitation, wages, benefits, payroll, taxes and workers compensation insurance) of its employees performing services under this Agreement. 

   

 14\. _Force Majeure_. If either party is prevented from complying, either totally or in part, with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike, lockout or other labor trouble, any Law, demand or other requirement of any Governmental Authority, riot, war, rebellion, acts of terrorism, acts of the public enemy or other causes beyond the reasonable control of such party or other acts of God, then upon written notice to the other party, the affected provisions and/or other requirements of this Agreement shall be suspended during the period of such disability (the " _Disability Period_ ") and the affected party shall have no liability to the other party or any other party in connection therewith; _provided_  that this _Section 14_ shall not apply to any payment to Cambrex required by this Agreement to the extent Cambrex or its Affiliates have provided the services for which payment is sought in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The affected party shall make all reasonable 

    ##### 

  

    

efforts to remove such disability within thirty (30) days after giving notice
of such disability (provided that such efforts shall not include settling any
labor disputes). At the request of Purchasers, the Term shall be extended for
a time period equal to any Disability Period. 

   

 15\. _Interpretation_. The headings and captions contained in this Agreement and in  _Annex A_ attached hereto are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean "including without limitation". 

   

 16\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by means of signature pages via facsimile), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. 

   

 17\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter. 

   

 18\. _Representation by Counsel; Interpretation_. Cambrex and Purchasers acknowledge that each of them has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. 

   

 19\. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. 

   

 20\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a contract executed and performed in such State, without regard to principles of conflict of Laws that would require the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. 

   

 21\. _Survival_. The provisions of _Sections 2_, _4_ , _7-13_ and  _15-22_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 22\. _Annex A_. _Annex A_ attached hereto and referred to herein is hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein.
