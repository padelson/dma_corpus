Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee whether the Indemnifying Party will assume
responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> for any legal or other
expenses (except expenses approved in advance by the Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by
such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; <U>provided</U> that if the defendants in
any such claim include both the Indemnifying Party and one or more Indemnitees and in any
Indemnitee&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between one or more of such Indemnitees and
such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnitees shall have the right to
employ separate counsel to represent such Indemnitees and in that event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one
separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such
Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a
Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in this<BR>
<U>Section
9.4(b)</U>, such Indemnitee may defend or (subject to the remainder of this <U>Section&nbsp;9.4(b)</U>
and <U>Section&nbsp;9.4(d)</U>) seek to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party. Neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall consent to entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee, in the case
of a consent or settlement by an Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnifying Party, in the case of a
consent or settlement by the Indemnitee, of a written release from all Liability in respect to such
Third Party Claim.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of October&nbsp;23, 2006 (the
&#147;<U>Stock Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings given to such terms in the Stock Purchase Agreement), by and among Cambrex and
Purchasers, Cambrex has agreed to sell and Purchasers have agreed to purchase (i)&nbsp;all of the issued

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Cambrex has agreed to provide certain
transition services to Purchasers and the Bio Companies following the Closing Date on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and covenants set forth herein and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Cambrex
and Purchasers agree as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <U>Transition Services</U>. During the term of this Agreement as set forth in <U>Section
5</U> below (the &#147;<U>Term</U>&#148;), Cambrex shall assist and cooperate with Purchasers to create an
orderly transition of the Bio Companies Business in the areas described in <U>Annex A</U> by
providing, or causing its Affiliates to provide, to Purchasers and their respective Affiliates (but
only to the extent such Affiliates operate the Bio Companies Business) the services set forth in
<U>Annex A</U> attached hereto (the &#147;<U>Transition Services</U>&#148;), from the date of this
Agreement and for the period of time described in <U>Annex A</U> attached hereto with respect to
each of the Transition Services, in the manner and at a relative level of service consistent in all
material respects with, but in no event materially higher or lower than, the typical level of
service provided by Cambrex or its Affiliates to the Bio Companies Business immediately prior to
the date hereof; <U>provided</U> that in no event are such Transition Services deemed to be expert
services. Cambrex shall not be obligated to provide any services to Purchasers other than the
Transition Services; <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;if any service that Cambrex provided to any of the
Bio Companies in the ordinary course of business immediately prior to the date hereof and that is
of a transitional nature is inadvertently omitted from the list of Transition Services or (ii)&nbsp;if
any Purchaser requires additional services of a transitional nature, then Cambrex and Purchaser
agree to negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to include such services (to the extent,
and only to the extent, that such services can be provided without resulting in a conflict of
interest for Cambrex) in <U>Annex A</U> at a cost to be determined in good faith, using the same
methodology as Cambrex used to determine the costs set forth in <U>Annex A</U>. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require Cambrex to provide priority to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Purchasers with respect to the Transition Services over Cambrex&#146;s businesses or those of any
of its Affiliates, Subsidiaries or divisions
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <U>Billing and Payment</U>. Cambrex shall issue Purchasers invoices for the Transition
Services at the beginning of each month during the Term. Each Purchaser shall promptly pay any
bills and invoices that it receives from Cambrex or its Affiliates for the Transition Services.
Each Purchaser shall pay interest on any amount overdue under this Agreement at the Prime Rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the term
of this Agreement plus two percent (2%) from the date due until payment, or, if lower, the highest
interest rate permitted by Law. All invoices shall be paid by wire transfer in accordance with the
instructions provided by Cambrex (in writing to the applicable Purchaser or Purchasers) not later
than ten (10)&nbsp;days following receipt by the applicable Purchaser or Purchasers of Cambrex&#146;s
invoice, unless such invoice is disputed in good faith within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of such
invoice. In the event that any Purchaser fails to make payment to Cambrex within forty-five (45)
days following receipt by such Purchaser of Cambrex&#146;s invoice (other than any invoice that was
timely disputed in good faith), Cambrex may terminate this Agreement upon notice to Purchasers.
Purchasers shall not offset any amounts owing to it by Cambrex or any of Cambrex&#146;s Affiliates
against amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <U>General Intent</U>. Cambrex shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide the
Transition Services at the price set forth in<BR>
<U>Annex A</U> during the Term and such other
transition assistance as the parties may otherwise agree. Each Purchaser agrees to use its
reasonable commercial efforts to end its need to use such assistance as soon as reasonably
practicable and in all events to end such need with respect to each Transition Service not later
than the termination of this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;5</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Walkersville Facility</U>. In connection with the provision of the Transition
Services, during the Term and for thirty (30)&nbsp;days thereafter, Cambrex and its Representatives
shall have full physical access to the data center facilities at Walkersville; <U>provided</U>
that Cambrex and its employees and Representatives shall comply with all of the security policies
and procedures of Purchasers and the Bio Companies. In addition, all Cambrex employees with
offices in the Walkersville facility immediately prior to the date hereof who are providing
Transition Services to Purchasers shall be permitted to retain their offices in the Walkersville
facility during the Term.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <U>Term of Agreement</U>. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof
and shall continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof) for a period not to
exceed two (2)&nbsp;months (the &#147;<U>Transition Period</U>&#148;). Purchasers may request an extension of
the term of any Transition Service set forth in <U>Annex A</U> by submitting a written request to
Cambrex to extend the term of such service (the &#147;<U>Extension Period</U>&#148;) thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior
to the end of any such service term. Cambrex may continue to provide such Transition Service to
Purchasers at the price set forth in <U>Annex A</U> during any Extension Period, and Cambrex&#146;s
consent to continue providing such service shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement and the obligations of Cambrex to provide any
services hereunder shall automatically terminate one (1)&nbsp;year after the date hereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <U>Partial Termination</U>. Any and all of the Transition Services provided by Cambrex
and its Affiliates are only terminable earlier than the period specified in <U>Annex A</U>
attached hereto by Purchasers on thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice to Cambrex. As soon as
reasonably practicable following receipt of any such notice, Cambrex shall advise Purchasers as to
whether termination of such Transition Service will require the termination or partial termination
of, or otherwise affect the provision of, certain other Transition Services. If such is the case,
Purchasers may withdraw their termination notice. Otherwise, such termination shall be final. All
periodic fees or charges under this Agreement are to be computed on a calendar month basis and, in
the event that any Transition Services are terminated pursuant to this Section, the fees or charges
shall be prorated on a per diem basis for any partial month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
any Extension Period the fees and charges shall not be prorated for any partial period for any
reason.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>Non-Solicitation of Employee</U>. For a period of two (2)&nbsp;years following the date
hereof, neither Purchasers nor any of their respective Affiliates will directly or indirect solicit
the employment of any officer or employee of Cambrex or any of its Affiliates so long as they are
employed by Cambrex or any of its Affiliates, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Cambrex, <U>provided</U> that the foregoing shall not prohibit any general solicitation or
advertising activities not targeted to any such officer or employee nor apply to any individual
whose employment is terminated by Cambrex or any Affiliate of Cambrex.

hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other party; <U>provided</U> that such consent shall not be required (i)&nbsp;for
assignments and transfers by operation of Law, (ii)&nbsp;in the event Cambrex assigns any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to a Person with whom Cambrex merges or to whom Cambrex
sells all or substantially all of its assets and (iii)&nbsp;for assignments and transfers by either
party to one or more of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (in the case of Purchasers such Subsidiaries
or Affiliates must be Subsidiaries or Affiliates that operate the Bio Companies Business). Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and void.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <U>Confidentiality</U>. Each of the parties will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person (other than any such Affiliate or
Representative), unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of any Law, all confidential or competitively sensitive information received in
connection with the provision of the Transition Services, except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (i)&nbsp;in the public domain (either prior to or after the
furnishing of such information) through no fault of such party or its Affiliates or its
Representatives or (ii)&nbsp;later acquired by such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives from
another source if such party, its Affiliates or its Representatives is unaware that such source is
under an obligation to the other party to keep such information confidential. This duty shall
continue throughout the term of this Agreement, and any renewals or extensions thereof, and after
termination thereof for a period of three (3)&nbsp;years.
