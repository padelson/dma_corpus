prior to the Closing, HFS shall deliver to Buyer a written statement setting
forth HFSs good-faith estimate of the Closing Adjustment Amount (the "
_Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount_ ") and the resulting Estimated Closing
Payment, calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
quantifying in reasonable detail the estimates of the items constituting such
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. Upon delivery of the statement setting
forth the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount and prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall have an opportunity to review such statement and the Parties shall
cooperate in good-faith to mutually agree upon the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount if Buyer disputes any item proposed to be set forth on such
statement; provided, that, if the Parties are not able to reach mutual
agreement prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount
set forth in the statement provided by HFS to Buyer shall be binding for
purposes of _Section 3.3(b)_, but not for purposes of _Section 2.5(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date, and in any event not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
HFS shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")

Amount in reasonable detail. The Sellers shall give Buyer and its authorized
representatives access to such employees, officers, facilities and such books

 



     

 

 



 

and records of the Sellers as are reasonably necessary to allow Buyer and its
authorized representatives to verify the Post-Closing Statement.

 



 

(c) _Dispute Procedures_. The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on the Sellers and Buyer on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the
date the Post-Closing Statement is received by Buyer, unless prior to such
date Buyer delivers a notice (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to HFS stating
that Buyer disagrees with HFSs calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount
(or any component thereof), which notice shall set forth all of Buyers
disputed items together with Buyers proposed changes thereto, including an
explanation in reasonable detail of the basis on which Buyer proposes such
changes. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts
contained in the Post-Closing Statement that are not specifically identified

Disagreement, then Buyer and HFS shall use their good-faith efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items to determine the Closing Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(d) _Independent Accountant_. If Buyer and HFS have not signed an agreement
resolving the disputed items by the thirtieth (30th) day following HFSs
receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, then the disputed items set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement may be submitted by Buyer or HFS to an independent
accounting firm approved by Buyer and HFS (the " _Independent Accountant_ ")

Buyer has disagreed and which are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement.
Each Party agrees that it shall not engage, or agree to engage the Independent
Accountant to perform any services other than as the Independent Accountant
pursuant hereto until the Post-Closing Statement and the Closing Adjustment
Amount have been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. In no event shall the Closing
Adjustment Amount as determined by the Independent Accountant be more
favorable to the Sellers than reflected on the Post-Closing Statement prepared
by HFS nor more favorable to Buyer than shown in the proposed changes
delivered by Buyer pursuant to its Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

(e) _Binding Effect_. If a Notice of Disagreement is timely given, the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount shall be deemed determined on the date that the
Independent Accountant gives notice to Buyer and HFS of its determination with
respect to all disputes regarding the calculation thereof, or, if earlier, the
date on which Buyer and HFS agree in writing on the amount thereof, in which
case the Final Closing Adjustment Amount shall be calculated in accordance
with such determination or agreement, as the case may be. Any determination of
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount by the Independent Accountant shall be
final and binding upon Buyer and the Sellers.

 



 

(f) _Adjustments_.

 



 

(i) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount of cash equal to
such excess.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then HFS shall pay to Buyer an amount of cash equal to such
difference.

 



 

(iii) Any payment required by this _Section 2.5(f)_ shall be made within five
(5) Business Days after the date the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is deemed
to be finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_, _2.5(c)_ or _2.5(d)_

Buyer will use their reasonable commercial efforts to obtain or cause to be
obtained in writing prior to the Closing Date any consents necessary to convey
the benefits thereof, and if such consents are not obtained, the applicable
Water Contracts, Surface Use Agreements or Water Permits will be deemed not to
have been transferred as of the Closing Date. If the consent of any Third

Contract, Surface Use Agreement or Water Permit shall not be assigned to
Buyer, the applicable Seller will continue to hold such Water Contract,

reasonable efforts to seek from the counterparty to such Combined Water
Agreement a bifurcation and restatement thereof on commercially reasonable
terms (consistent with the purposes and intent of this Agreement and
consistent with the terms and conditions of the applicable Combined Water
Agreement) that results in two separate agreements, one solely between the
counterparty and the applicable Seller or its Affiliate reflecting the
Partially Retained Agreement and another solely between the counterparty and
Buyer reflecting the Partially Assigned Agreement.

Applications or require the consent of a Third Party, and (iii) the Sellers

necessary to convey the applicable Pending Permit Applications (and any rights
to a Permit upon approval of such Pending Permit Applications), and if such
waivers or consents are not obtained, the applicable Pending Permit
Applications (and any rights to a Permit upon approval of such Pending Permit
Applications) will be deemed not to have been transferred as of the Closing
Date. If any Pending Permit Application is not transferred to Buyer at
Closing, then upon the reasonable request of Buyer and at Buyers sole cost
and expense, for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, (A)
the applicable Seller will continue to hold such Pending Permit Application
for the benefit of Buyer, and (B) the Parties will continue to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have such Pending Permit Application (or
the Permit issued upon approval thereof) transferred to or issued in the name
of Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (1) in connection
with such efforts, no Seller shall have any obligation to incur any costs or
expenses or issue or post any letter of credit, bond or guarantee, (2) Buyer
shall reimburse the Sellers for any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs
or expenses incurred by any Seller in connection with such efforts, (3) Buyer
shall indemnify the HFS Indemnified Parties for any Liabilities incurred or
suffered by any HFS Indemnified Party in connection with such efforts and (4)
subject to compliance with this _Section 6.7(c)_, Sellers shall have no
liability for the failure to assign any Pending Permit Application or the
failure to obtain any Permit to be issued upon approval thereof.

 



 

(d) With respect to any Retained Fee Property and Water Well(s) that are
subject to Pending Permit Applications (the " _Pending Permit Property_ ") and
not transferred to Buyer at Closing, (i) the Parties will enter into a surface
use agreement, in form and substance mutually acceptable to both Parties, that
gives Buyer the right to access and utilize the Pending Permit Property until
such Pending Permit Application (or the Permit issued upon approval thereof)
is transferred to or issued in the name of Buyer and such Pending Permit
Property is conveyed or transferred to Buyer, and (ii) on the date that any
Pending Permit Application (or the Permit issued upon approval thereof) is
transferred to or issued in the name of Buyer, the Parties will enter into one
or more Deeds or Bills of Sale, as applicable, necessary to effectuate the
transfer, assignment and conveyance to Buyer of the Pending Permit Property
associated with such Pending Permit Application, which Pending Permit Property
shall consist of a number of acres generally consistent with the number of
acres surrounding the Water Wells of the same type that are transferred at
Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare or cause to
be prepared prior to Closing surveys and plats reasonably acceptable to Buyer
for all Owned Real Property, and shall provide such surveys and plats to Buyer
promptly upon receipt thereof; provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the delivery of such surveys and plats shall not be a condition to
Closing, but in the event that such surveys and plats are not delivered to
Buyer prior to Closing, Sellers shall continue to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver such surveys and plats promptly thereafter. To
the extent any Pending Permit Property will be conveyed to Buyer in fee,
Sellers shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare or cause to
be prepared after Closing, but prior to the transfer of such Pending Permit
Property, surveys and plats reasonably acceptable to Buyer for such Pending
Permit Property.

 



 

6.8 _Amendment of Schedules_.

 



 

(a) Following the Execution Date and prior to the Closing Date (subject to
_Section 3.1_), the Sellers shall supplement or amend all Schedules of the
Sellers under _Article 4_ to include reference to any matter relating to the
Sellers, the Water Assets or the Water Business and hereafter arising, which,
if existing at the Execution Date, would have been required to be set forth or
described on such Schedules in order to avoid any inaccuracies in the
respective representations and warranties (each, a " _Schedule Supplement_ ").
Sellers shall deliver any Schedule Supplement to Buyer as soon as reasonably
practicable after the discovery by Sellers of the occurrence of the matter
giving rise to such disclosure. Upon delivery to Buyer of such Schedule
Supplement, HFS shall also concurrently deliver to Buyer a written statement
setting forth HFSs reasonable good-faith estimate of the amount (if any)
required to cure or correct (the " _Cure Amount_ ") the matters disclosed on
such Schedule Supplement (the " _Schedule Supplement Matters_ ").

 



 

(b) If the Schedule Supplement Matters would cause the closing condition in
_Section 7.1(a)_ not to be satisfied, then Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(c)_.

 



 

(c) If the Schedule Supplement Matters would not result in the failure of the
closing condition in _Section 7.1(a)_ to be satisfied and such Schedule
Supplement Matters remain uncured by Sellers as of the Closing Date, HFS and
Buyer shall use good-faith efforts to agree upon the Cure Amount for such
Schedule Supplement Matters. If HFS and Buyer agree upon the Cure Amount for
such Schedule Supplement Matters prior to Closing, the Estimated Closing
Payment shall be reduced by such agreed-upon Cure Amount and such Schedule
Supplement shall be deemed to have modified Sellers representations and
warranties for all purposes hereunder and Buyer shall be deemed to have waived
any right or claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise,
including pursuant to _Article 10_, with respect to any and all such Schedule
Supplement Matters. If HFS and Buyer are unable to agree upon a Cure Amount
for such Schedule Supplement Matters prior to Closing, the Estimated Closing
Payment shall be reduced by the Cure Amount set forth in Sellers statement,
but Buyer shall retain the right to seek indemnification pursuant to _Article
10_ for any Liabilities arising from such Schedule Supplement Matters in
excess of the Cure Amount reflected as an adjustment to the Estimated Closing
Payment (" _Indemnifiable Schedule Supplement Matters_ "). This _Section 6.8_
shall not apply to Environmental Defects or the resolution thereof, which
shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 6.13_.

 



     

 

 



 

6.9 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts_. Except as set forth in _Schedule
6.9_, each of the Affiliate Contracts shall be terminated immediately prior to
the Closing and the parties to such Contracts shall execute releases
reasonably requested by Buyer to ensure that Buyer shall have no liability or
obligation thereunder.

 



 

6.10 _Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges that, at or promptly following the
Closing, the Insurance Polices shall be terminated or modified to exclude
coverage of all of the Water Assets, and, as a result, Buyer shall be
obligated at or before Closing to obtain at its sole cost and expense
replacement insurance and including insurance required by any Third Party to
be maintained for the continued operations of the Water Business. If required
by Law or contract, Buyer shall provide to Governmental Authorities and Third
Parties evidence of such replacement or substitute insurance coverage for the
continued operations of the Water Business following the Closing. If
requested, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Buyer in
obtaining such replacement policies, including by providing copies of the
Insurance Policies and all other information reasonably required by Buyer.

 



 

6.11 _Exclusivity_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the earlier of (i) the Closing
Date or (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated as provided in _Article
9_, the Sellers shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of their
Affiliates or any of its or their representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(A) encourage, solicit, initiate with, facilitate or continue inquiries with
any Person regarding any proposal for the Water Assets (other than assets sold
in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)_) or the Water Business by such Person
(other than Buyer or its representatives), directly or indirectly, whether by
merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, purchase of equity
interests, sale of assets or any other means (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ");
(B) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (C) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. The Sellers shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause their Affiliates and all of its and their
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Sellers agree that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.11_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that
money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

 



 

6.12 _Financial Records and Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) For a period following the Closing Date until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, Sellers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to), in a manner
consistent with their respective past practices with respect to the
preparation of financial information:

 



 

(i) make all financial records and all financial information related to the
Water Assets (the " _Financial Records_ ") for the period prior to the Closing
Date that is

 



     

 

 



 

necessary for Buyer to prepare and obtain the audit of any financial
statements relating to the Water Assets to the extent required to be filed
(such filings, the " _Filings_ ") by Buyer or its Affiliates with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations
thereunder available to Buyer and its representatives at Sellers offices;

 



 

(ii) provide Buyer with reasonable access, at reasonable times and upon prior
notice, and at no cost to Sellers, to the employees of Sellers or their
Affiliates associated with the preparation of such Financial Records for
purposes of performing Buyers audits and financial filings required by a
Governmental Authority;

 



 

(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Sellers independent
auditors to provide, at Buyers sole cost and expense, such assistance as
Buyer may reasonable request in connection with the preparation of any
Filings;

 



 

(iv) provide reasonable cooperation to the independent auditors chosen by
Buyer (" _Buyer s Auditor_") in connection with any audit by Buyers Auditor
of any financial statements of Sellers with respect to the Water Assets that
Buyer or any of its Affiliates required to comply with the Securities Act or
Exchange Act with respect to any Filings; and

 



 

(v) retain all relevant information and documents in its possession that would
reasonably be expected to be necessary in connection with the preparation and
audit of financial statements with respect to the Water Assets as provided in
this _Section 6.12_.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, (i) Sellers shall have no
obligation to provide any financial statements or other information (A) to the
extent it would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or contravene any
applicable Law or any confidentiality undertaking or (B) that is not required
by the SEC, and (ii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the periods and dates presented of financial statements and other
information to be included in such financial statements that would otherwise
be required by the SEC, including, by promptly seeking waivers, exemptions or
advice from the staff of the SEC. In no event shall Sellers be required to pay
or incur any costs or expenses in connection with the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.12_.

 



 

6.13 _Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Information_. Buyer shall provide to HFS (free of cost)
copies of all final environmental reports generated by Buyers Third-Party
consultants promptly after receipt thereof to the extent not restricted or
prohibited by the terms of the applicable Contract between Buyer (or its
Affiliate) and such Third-Party consultant; provided, however, that to the
extent Buyer is so restricted or prohibited by the terms of the applicable
Contract, Buyer shall provide to HFS a detailed description of the underlying
findings therein and any supporting information related thereto. Except (i) as
may be required or permitted pursuant to the exercise of the rights and
fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under this Agreement,

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) as may be required by applicable Law, or (iii) for information which is
or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Person against whom this
sentence is sought to be enforced, Buyer and Sellers and their respective
Affiliates shall maintain, and shall cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, contractors, consultants, and other advisors to
maintain, all information, reports (whether interim, draft, final, or
otherwise), data, work product, and other matters obtained or generated from
or attributable to the Buyers environmental review pursuant to _Section 6.2_
and this _Section 6.13_ (the " _Environmental Information_ ") strictly
confidential, and shall not disclose all or any portion of the Environmental
Information to any Third Party without the written consent of Buyer or
Sellers, as applicable, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall continue to be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to the Environmental Information. Each Party shall be responsible for
the compliance of its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, contractors, consultants, and other advisors with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _NORM Acknowledgment_. Buyer acknowledges that equipment and sites located
on or included in the Water Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including
asbestos and naturally occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ ").
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
DOCUMENT EXECUTED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS DO NOT MAKE, SELLERS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, AND BUYER WAIVES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ASBESTOS OR NORM IN OR
ON THE WATER ASSETS IN QUANTITIES TYPICAL FOR OILFIELD AND WATER PRODUCTION
OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS WHERE THE WATER ASSETS ARE LOCATED.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Environmental Defects_. To assert any alleged Environmental
Defect, Buyer must deliver to HFS, on or before the Defect Notice Date, one or
more Defect Notices. Buyer agrees to use reasonable good-faith efforts to
provide HFS with periodic (but in no event less frequently than before 4:00
p.m. local time in Houston, Texas on Friday of each week prior to the Defect
Notice Date) updates in writing (email being sufficient) concerning the
progress of Buyers environmental due diligence prior to the Defect Notice
Date (including any potential Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer),
which updates can be preliminary in nature; provided that Buyers failure to
provide any such preliminary notice pursuant to this sentence shall not act as
a waiver of or otherwise limit any claim, right or remedy of Buyer under this
Agreement with respect to any Environmental Defect.

 



 

(d) _Cure_.

 



 

(i) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure or remove, on or before the
Closing Date, any alleged Environmental Defects of which HFS has been advised
by Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.13(c)_. The election by Sellers to attempt to
cure one or more of such alleged Environmental Defects shall not affect the
rights and obligations of the Parties under _Section 6.13(g)_ with respect to
dispute resolution and shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights of
Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.13_, including Sellers right to dispute
the existence, nature, or value of such Environmental Defect.

 



     

 



 

(ii) Any dispute relating to whether and to what extent an Environmental
Defect has been cured shall be deemed to be a Disputed Matter and shall be
resolved as set forth in _Section 6.13(g)_; provided, however, that any prior
or concurrent determination by an Environmental Arbitrator with respect to
Environmental Defects (or factual or legal matters relating thereto, even if
determined in connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated
dispute) which Sellers have elected to attempt to cure pursuant to _Section
6.13(d)(i)_ shall be binding on the Parties with respect to such Environmental
Defect (or factual or legal matters relating thereto, even if determined in
connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated dispute).

 



 

(e) _Adjustment for Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(i) With respect to each Water Asset affected by an Environmental Defect
reported under _Section 6.13(c)_, such Water Asset shall be assigned at
Closing subject to all uncured Environmental Defects, and the purchase price
shall be reduced at Closing as provided in _Section 6.13(e)(iii)_ and after
Closing as provided in _Section 6.13(e)(iv)_, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) HFS and Buyer shall use good faith efforts to attempt to agree upon the
existence of any alleged Environmental Defects reported pursuant to _Section
6.13(c)_, and any corresponding Environmental Defect Amounts, on or before the
Closing Date. If HFS and Buyer are unable to agree by the Closing Date, then
Sellers good-faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount shall be
deemed to be the " _Estimated Defect Amount_." Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any alleged Environmental Defect reported pursuant to _Section 6.13(c)_ (or
the alleged cure thereof) and any corresponding Environmental Defect Amount
which is then in dispute (each a " _Disputed Matter_ ") shall be exclusively
and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to _Section 6.13(g)_ or by
agreement of the Parties.

 



 

(iii) At Closing, the Estimated Closing Payment shall be reduced by (A) the
Environmental Defect Amount (or portion thereof) with respect to any
Environmental Defects which are not Disputed Matters and (B) the Estimated
Defect Amount with respect to any Environmental Defects which are Disputed
Matters.

 



 

(iv) After Closing, the purchase price paid hereunder may be further adjusted
as provided in this _Section 6.13(e)(iv)_ for any Environmental Defects which
are Disputed Matters. Within ten (10) days after the determination of all
Disputed Matters submitted to a Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to _Section
6.13(g)_ (or the date upon which the Parties reach an agreement, if earlier)
and after consideration of all other adjustments previously made to the
purchase price and after giving effect to the limitations provided in this
_Section 6.13_ (1) HFS shall pay to Buyer or (2) Buyer shall pay to HFS, as
applicable, the net amounts to which the applicable Party is entitled to
pursuant to this _Section 6.13(e)_ with respect to any Disputed Matters, as
determined by the Environmental Arbitrator under _Section 6.13(g)_. The
Parties shall treat for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to this
_Section 6.13(e)_ as an adjustment to the purchase price hereunder and any
payment made pursuant to this _Section 6.13(e)_ shall be

 



     

 

 



 

made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or
accounts to be designated in writing by the Party receiving such payment.

 



 

(f) _Calculation of Environmental Defect Amounts_. The amount resulting from
an Environmental Defect (the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ ") shall be
determined as follows:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and HFS agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall include, but shall not exceed, the
reasonable cost of the response required under Environmental Laws that
addresses the applicable Environmental Defect to the extent required by
applicable Environmental Laws as of the Defect Notice Date at the lowest
commercially reasonable cost (considered as a whole taking into consideration
any material negative impact such response may have on the operations of the
relevant Water Assets (as currently operated) and any potential material
additional costs or liabilities that would reasonably be expected to arise as
a result of such response) as compared to any other response that is required
under Environmental Laws;

 



 

(iii) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount or adjustment to the purchase price
hereunder;

 



 

(iv) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to a Disputed Matter shall
be the amount finally determined pursuant to _Section 6.13(g)_ or agreed to
by the Parties, in each case, taking into account the limitations set forth in
this _Section 6.13(f)_; and

 



 

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.13_:

 



 

(A) an individual claim for an Environmental Defect for which a valid Defect
Notice is given prior to the Defect Notice Date shall only generate a
reduction to the purchase price hereunder if the Environmental Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds $250,000 (the " _Individual Defect Threshold_ ");
and

 



 

(B) in the event that the aggregate of all Environmental Defect Amounts that
would generate a reduction to the purchase price hereunder pursuant to
_Section 6.13(f)(v)(A)_ is in excess of $25,000,000 (the " _Aggregate Defect
Threshold_ "), then either Party may terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 9.1(e)_.

 



 

(g) _Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

(i) With respect to any Disputed Matter, on or before a date that is thirty
(30) days following the Closing Date, management representatives of the
Parties with direct authority to enter into a settlement agreement shall meet
and make a good

 



     

 

 



 

faith effort to resolve any Disputed Matter. In the event the management
representatives are unable to resolve such Disputed Matter within thirty (30)
days after commencement of the meetings to resolve such Disputed Matter, then
Buyer may submit all remaining Disputed Matters to a reputable and qualified
environmental consultant with at least ten (10) years experience in
corrective environmental action regarding oil and gas properties in the State
of Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and HFS (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "). If Buyer and HFS have not agreed upon a Person
to serve as Environmental Arbitrator within ten (10) days, Buyer shall, within
five (5) days after the end of such initial ten (10) day period, formally
apply to the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to
choose the Environmental Arbitrator and submit such Disputed Matters along
with such application. The Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as
an employee or outside consultant for any Party or its Affiliates during the
five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest
in the dispute other than the payment of the Environmental Arbitrators fees
and expenses incurred as Environmental Arbitrator.

 



 

(ii) The arbitration proceeding for any Disputed Matter described in _Section
6.13(g)(i)_ shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section 6.13(g)_. The Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made
within forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In
making their respective determinations, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be
bound by the provisions of this _Section 6.13_ and may consider such other
matters as, in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator may
consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the arbitrator.
The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as experts for the limited purpose of
determining the specific Disputed Matters submitted by any Party and may not
award damages, interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Sellers and Buyer shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of
presenting their respective cases to any Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to
this _Section 6.13(g)_. Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Environmental Arbitrator, and Sellers shall be responsible for the
remaining one-half of the costs and expenses.

 



 

6.14 _Water Services Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate prior
to Closing (and enter into at Closing) a form of Water Services Agreement
containing terms that are consistent in all material respects with the terms
set forth on _Exhibit F-2_ and such additional terms that are reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the " _Water Services Agreement_ "). If the
Parties have agreed upon a form of Water Services Agreement prior to Closing,
Buyer and Sellers (or an Affiliate of Sellers) shall execute and deliver to
each other a counterpart of such Water Services Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(b) If the Parties fail to execute and deliver a Water Services Agreement at
the Closing, then (i) Buyer shall withhold from and reduce the Estimated
Closing Payment by Thirty

 



     

 

 



 

Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Water Supply Asset Value_ "), (ii) the
Water Assets transferred from Sellers to Buyer at Closing shall not include
the Freshwater Wells or flowlines related thereto (the " _Retained Water
Supply Assets_ "), (iii) the Parties shall revise the Bill of Sale, the Shared
Use Agreement, and any other documents or certificates delivered pursuant to
this Agreement to give effect to the exclusion of the Retained Water Supply
Assets and (iv) for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date (the "
_WSA Negotiation Period_ "), the Parties shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into a Water Services Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Parties execute and deliver a Water Services Agreement during the
WSA Negotiation Period, then concurrently with the execution of such
agreement, Buyer and Sellers shall enter into one or more Bills of Sale
necessary to effectuate the transfer, assignment and conveyance to Buyer of
the Retained Water Supply Assets, and Buyer shall pay the Water Supply Asset
Value by wire transfer to HFS in immediately available funds.

 



 

6.15 _Cooperation Related to Monument Draw Water_. Prior to Closing, the
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other (i) to develop and
implement operational procedures and systems that enhance or maintain the
quality of the Produced Water (as defined in the Produced Water Agreement)
after being received from production at wells located within the Monument Draw
Operating Area (the " _Monument Draw Water_ ") such that the Monument Draw
Water meets (or continues to meet) the specification set forth in Section
8.1(k) of the Produced Water Agreement, or (ii) to mutually agree upon
alternative arrangements that address or remedy a failure of the Monument Draw
Water to meet such specification, including consideration of an adjustment to
the Service Fee (as defined in the Produced Water Agreement).

 



 

6.16 _Covenant to Satisfy Closing Conditions_. From the Execution Date until
the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing
conditions set forth _Article 7_.

if made on such specific date or time), except to the extent that the failure
of such representations or warranties (other than the HFS Fundamental
Representations) to be true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that neither
satisfaction of this condition nor completion of Closing will affect Buyers
rights under _Article 10_. The Sellers shall have performed or complied in
all material respects with all

on the Closing Date as if made on such date (or, in the case of

_Section 2.3_, as adjusted pursuant to _Sections 2.5_, _6.8_ , and _6.13_ ,

(the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be delivered by Sellers to Buyer
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the final calculation of the purchase
price for Buyers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good-
faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation. Neither Sellers nor
Buyer shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation and
neither Sellers nor Buyer shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation by any Governmental Authority without first giving the other Party
prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Sellers or Buyer from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment
by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and
neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority challenging
such Allocation.

 



 

8.2 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall be responsible for filing with the appropriate Governmental
Authority any Asset Tax Return relating to the Water Assets that is required
to be filed before the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax
Return as due and owing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for filing with the appropriate Governmental
Authority any Asset Tax Return relating to the Water Assets that is required
to be filed on or after the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on
such Tax Return as due and owing. Buyer shall prepare any Asset Tax Return
relating to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending before the
Effective Time on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer shall provide Sellers with a
copy of any such Asset

 



     

 

 



 

Tax Return for Sellers review at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return, and Buyer shall incorporate into such Tax
Return any comments of Sellers provided to Buyer in advance of the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return.

 



 

8.3 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For purposes of determining the allocation
of Asset Taxes to a Straddle Period: (a) Asset Taxes that are based upon or
related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis, shall be
allocated to the portion of such period (e.g., that portion ending prior to
the Effective Time or that portion beginning at the Effective Time) in which
the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (b) Asset Taxes
that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such
Straddle Period ending prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset
Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur
before the Effective Time, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur from and after the Effective Time, on the other
hand.

 



 

8.4 _Tax Refunds_. Sellers shall be entitled to any and all refunds or credits
of Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities. If Buyer receives a refund or credit
of Taxes to which any Seller is entitled pursuant to this _Section 8.4_,
Buyer shall promptly pay such amount to such Seller.

 



 

8.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, vehicle, sales, use, stamp,
registration, recording, filing and other similar Taxes and fees arising out
of or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement,
including any costs associated with preparing and filing any related Tax
Returns (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers, on the other hand.
Buyer shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed
all Tax Returns it is required by applicable Law to file with respect to
Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Law, any other Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation. The Parties shall, upon request, use reasonable
efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax, including by
obtaining any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to so mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Transfer Tax, including a properly completed and executed Texas Comptroller of
Public Account Form 01-917, Statement of Occasional Sale, to the extent
applicable.

 



 

8.6 _Tax Contest_. If, after the Closing Date, Buyer receives notice of an
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to any Asset Tax
or Asset Tax Return related to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Tax Contest_ "), Buyer shall notify Sellers
within ten (10) days of such notice. Sellers shall have the option to control
the conduct and resolution of any such Tax Contest for which Sellers would
reasonably be expected to have an indemnification obligation pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and Sellers may exercise such option by providing
written notice to Buyer within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of such
Tax Contest from Buyer; provided, that, if Sellers do not so exercise such
option, in which case Buyer shall (a) keep Sellers informed of the progress of
such Tax Contest, (b) provide Sellers with copies of material correspondence
with respect to such Tax Contest, (c) permit Sellers (or Sellers counsel) to
participate in meetings (including conference calls) with the applicable
Governmental Authority with respect to such Tax Contest, and (d) not

 



     

 

 



 

effect any settlement or compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining
Sellers prior written consent thereto, which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed, or withheld.

 



 

8.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Except as required by applicable Law, any
payments pursuant to _Article 10_ shall be treated as adjustments to the
purchase price hereunder for applicable Tax purposes.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION**

 



 

9.1 _Events of Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and HFS;

 



 

(b) by Buyer or HFS, in writing delivered to other Party after January 31,
2019 (the " _Termination Date_ "), if the Closing has not occurred by such
date, _provided_ that as of such date the terminating Party is not in default
in any material respect of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Buyer or HFS, in writing delivered to the other Party, without
prejudice to other rights and remedies that the terminating Party or its
Affiliates may have (provided the terminating Party and its Affiliates are not
otherwise in material default or breach of this Agreement, and have not failed
or refused to close without justification hereunder), if with respect to the
other Party (i) there shall be a breach of any representation or warranty of
such other Party that would cause a failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_ or _7.2(a)_ , as applicable, or (ii) there shall be a breach
by such other Party of any of its covenants or agreements that would cause a
failure of the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.2(a)_,
as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of _clauses (i)_ or
_(ii)_ , the defaulting Party shall have a period of ten (10) days following
written notice from the non-defaulting Party to cure any breach of this
Agreement, if such breach is curable;

 



 

(d) by Buyer or HFS, in writing delivered to the other Party, without
liability, if there shall be any final and non-appealable order, writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority binding on the non-
terminating Party, which prohibits or restrains such party from consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 



 

(e) by Buyer or HFS, in writing delivered to HFS (in the case of a termination
by Buyer) or in writing delivered to Buyer (in the case of a termination by
HFS), without liability, if the Aggregate Defect Threshold is exceeded as set
forth in _Section 6.13(f)(v)(B)_.

 



 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If the obligation to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
_Section_ _9.1_ , then, except for the provisions of _Sections 1.1_, _1.2_
, _6.2(a)_ , _6.2(c)_ , _Article 11_ and this _Section 9.2_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and the Parties shall have no liability or
obligation hereunder; _provided_ that, in the event of a willful or
intentional breach, the non-breaching Party or Parties shall be entitled to
exercise all remedies available at Law or in equity. For the avoidance of

 



     

 

 



 

doubt, the failure of a Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement when required pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be
a willful breach by such Party.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

10.1 _Indemnification of Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the Sellers, jointly and severally, from and after the Closing
Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective securityholders, directors, officers, and employees (collectively
the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party (whether such
Liabilities relate to a Third Party Claim or a Direct Claim) (a) as a result
of any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Sellers set
forth in this Agreement, (b) as a result of any breach or nonperformance of
any agreement or covenant of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement, (c)
related to the Excluded Liabilities or (d) arising from any Indemnifiable

10.2 _Indemnification of the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold the Sellers, their
Affiliates, and their respective securityholders, directors, officers, and
employees (collectively, the " _HFS Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by the HFS Indemnified
Parties (whether such Liabilities relate to a Third Party Claim or a Direct
Claim) (a) as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, (b) as a result of any breach
or nonperformance of any agreement or covenant of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, or (c) related to the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

10.3 _Survival_. All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing; _provided_ that, (a) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 4_ and _Article 5_ shall survive until 5:00 pm Houston time on the
day that is twelve (12) calendar months after the Closing Date, at which time
such representations and warranties shall terminate and expire, except that
(i) the HFS Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing indefinitely and (ii) the

(Taxes) shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty (30) days following

under _clause (d)_ of _Section 10.1_ shall survive until 5:00 pm Houston
time on the day that is twelve (12) calendar months after the Closing Date.
After a representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no
indemnification shall or may be sought pursuant to this _Article 10_ on the
basis of that representation and warranty by any Person who would have been
entitled pursuant to this _Article 10_ to indemnification on the basis of
that representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration,
_provided_ that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall
terminate and expire as provided in this _Section 10.3_, no claim presented
in writing for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_ on the basis of
that representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall
be affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement (A) to be performed

 



     

 

 



 

prior to the Closing shall terminate and expire as of the first anniversary of
the Closing Date and (B) to be performed after the Closing shall survive until
fully performed.

 



 

10.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Liabilities pursuant to _Section 10.1_, the Sellers shall
not have any Liability (i) for any individual indemnifiable item (or series of
related items) which does not exceed $100,000 (the " _Individual Indemnity
Threshold_ "), and (ii) in respect of those individual indemnifiable items
that exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold, unless the aggregate
Liabilities relating to all such individual indemnifiable items exceed in the
aggregate an amount equal to $3,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and
then only to the extent of any such excess. In no event shall the Sellers
aggregate liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceed an amount equal to
$20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Individual
Indemnity Threshold, the Deductible Amount and the Cap shall not apply to
indemnification for Liabilities relating to HFS Fundamental Representations or
to any indemnification obligation under _Section 10.1(b)_ or _10.1(c)_ and
(B) the Individual Indemnity Threshold and the Deductible Amount shall not
apply to any indemnification obligation under _clause (d)_ of _Section
10.1_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers aggregate liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to
indemnification under this _Article 10_ shall in no event exceed the Base
Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining the Liabilities subject to indemnity pursuant
to this _Article 10_, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
in the representations and warranties (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in (x) the parenthetical in _Section 4.14(a)_ and (y)
_Section 4.15(b)_, and in each case, the related definitions) shall be
disregarded.

 



 

(c) In calculating any amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party by reason of
the provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all insurance
proceeds and any indemnification reimbursement proceeds actually received from
Third Parties related to the Liabilities, in each case net of all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred in the recovery of such proceeds. No Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to double recovery for any particular
item for which an adjustment has already been made to the purchase price under
the terms of this Agreement (whether at Closing or thereafter) or with respect
to which indemnification is provided under this Agreement. In calculating
amounts payable to any Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of any
indemnified Liability shall be determined without duplication of any
adjustment to the purchase price or any other Liability for which an
indemnification claim has been made with respect to any other representation
or warranty, or covenant or agreement that contemplates performance thereof
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Except as provided in _Section 6.13_, the right to indemnification
provided by this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted
by the Party to or for whom such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation is made with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired prior to the
Closing Date.

 



     

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall
have no obligation under this Agreement to indemnify any Person for any
Liabilities (including Environmental Liabilities) to the extent that such
Liabilities are incurred (i) as a result of any remedial, removal or other
response action in excess of the reasonable cost of the response required
under Environmental Laws that addresses the applicable cause of such
Liabilities to the extent required by applicable Environmental Laws at the
lowest commercially reasonable cost (considered as a whole taking into
consideration any material negative impact such response may have on the
operations of the relevant Water Assets (as operated on the Closing Date) or
any potential material additional costs or liabilities that may likely arise
as a direct result of such response) as compared to any other response that is
required under Environmental Laws or (ii) in order to meet a more stringent
cleanup standard than that set forth in clause (i) which result from a change
in land use from the use in effect as of the Closing Date, or from a change of
Law relative to that which is in effect as of the Closing Date. Buyer agrees
not to compel, induce, or solicit, whether directly or indirectly, any
Governmental Authority to require any environmental action, investigation,
monitoring or remediation unless affirmatively required to do so by
Environmental Laws.

 



 

(f) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS _ARTICLE 10_, NO PARTY
NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 10_ OR
OTHERWISE FOR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES CONSTITUTE DIRECT DAMAGES), WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
GROSS NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BY CONTRACT OR STATUTE, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH A FINALLY ADJUDICATED THIRD PARTY CLAIM, IN WHICH CASE SUCH
DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE (TO THE EXTENT RECOVERABLE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE
10_) WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THIS _SECTION 10.4(f)_.

 



 

10.5 _Defense of Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice_. If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or of the commencement of any Third Party Claim with respect to which
indemnification is to be sought from the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party will give such Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof. However, the
failure to give timely notice will not affect the rights or obligations of the
Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced. Such notice shall describe the
nature of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the
estimated amount, if practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right
to participate in or, by giving notice to the Indemnified Party, subject to
_Section 10.5(b)_, to elect to assume the defense of, any Third Party Claim
at such Indemnifying Partys own expense and by such Indemnifying Partys own
counsel.

 



 

(b) _Opportunity to Defend_. If within ten (10) days after an Indemnified
Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party receives notice from the Indemnifying Party that such
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its

 



     

 

 



 

sole cost and expense, such Third Party Claim (other than any Third Party
Claim of a criminal or regulatory nature, or which seeks or in respect of
which there has been granted non-monetary or injunctive relief). If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Liability
indemnified against hereunder, the Indemnified Party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Party (x) there are defenses available to the Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party, or (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable, and it is determined that the Third Party Claim is
subject to a valid claim of indemnity against the Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.1_. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into
any settlement of any Third Party Claim which (i) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Third-Party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a full release from all liability in respect thereof, and
(ii) contains any admission or statement of any wrongdoing or liability on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. If a firm offer is made by the Third Party to
settle a Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and
agree to such offer and indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect thereof,
the Indemnifying Party will give notice to the Indemnified Party to that
effect. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within
ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim will be the amount of such settlement offer, plus reasonable costs and
expenses paid or incurred by the Indemnified Party up to the date of such
notice.

 



 

(c) _Direct Claim_. Any Direct Claim will be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the
nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated amount,
if practicable. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30) days
from receipt of such claim within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to such Direct Claim, the Indemnified
Party will be free to seek enforcement of its right to indemnification under
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Conflicts_. To the extent the provisions of this _Section 10.5_ are
inconsistent with _Section 8.6_, _Section 8.6_ shall control.

 



 

10.6 _Sole Remedy_. Following the Closing, no Party shall have liability under
this Agreement or with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, except
(a) for claims arising from a Partys actual common law fraud with intent to
deceive in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(b) as is provided in _Article 8_ or this _Article 10_.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein and regardless of whether
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Sellers, on the one

carrying this Agreement into effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear equally the
expenses related to the assignment, conveyance and transfer of the Water
Assets to Buyer as contemplated by this Agreement.

waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of
any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written
waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
before or after that waiver. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, no failure by a Party to exercise, or delay in exercising, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate or be construed as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege.

 



 

11.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither this Agreement nor

their respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits, or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising hereunder or in
connection herewith shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas without regard to the
principles of conflicts of Law.

 



 

11.6 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Harris County, Texas and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in Harris County, Texas over
any dispute between or among the Parties arising out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party irrevocably agrees
that all such claims in respect of such dispute shall only be heard and
determined in such courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such dispute arising out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each Party agrees, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that a final and unappealable
judgment against it in any action contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, a certified
copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such
judgment. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

11.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision
to other Persons or circumstances is not affected thereby and that provision
shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, and the Parties
shall promptly meet and negotiate substitute provisions for those rendered or
declared illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

11.8 _Interpretation_. It is expressly agreed by the Parties that neither this
Agreement nor any of the Transaction Documents shall be construed against any
party thereto, and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the
basis of who drafted this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any provision
hereof or thereof or who supplied the form of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents. Each Party agrees that this Agreement has been
purposefully drawn and correctly reflects its understanding of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, therefore, waives the
application of any Law, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or document, it being understood that the
parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and have had adequate opportunity
and means to retain counsel to represent their interests and to otherwise
negotiate the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

11.9 _Headings and Schedules_. The headings and captions herein are inserted
for convenience of reference only and are not intended to govern, limit or aid
