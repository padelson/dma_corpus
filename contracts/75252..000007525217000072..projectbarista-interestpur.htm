"Company"), and solely for the purposes of Section 10.20 of this Agreement,
Owens and Minor, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Guarantor"). The Buyers, the
Sellers and the Company are sometimes individually referred to in this
Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties". Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit A
attached hereto.

WHEREAS, the Sellers collectively own one hundred percent (100%) of the

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Buyers desire to purchase from the Sellers, and the Sellers
desire to sell to the Buyers, all of the Interests;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors or equivalent governing body, as
applicable, of each of the Buyers, the Sellers and the Company have approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Group
Companies and certain key employees of the Group Companies listed on Schedule
1 (the "Key Employees") have entered into retention agreements (collectively,
the "Retention Agreements").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings contained herein, and
subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I 

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to the Buyers, and the Buyers shall purchase and acquire
from the Sellers, all of the Interests, free and clear of all Liens.

Section 1.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for all of the
Interests (the "Purchase Price") shall be an amount equal to the sum of:

(a) $380,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"); 

(b) plus the amount (if any) by which Net Working Capital exceeds the Target
Net Working Capital;

(c) plus the Cash and Cash Equivalents;

(d) minus the Company Transaction Expenses;

(e) minus the outstanding amounts of Indebtedness and Debt-Like Items of the
Group Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing; and

(f) minus the amount (if any) by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds
Net Working Capital.

Section 1.3 Closing Date Statements. Not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyers:

(a) a statement (the "Closing Date Financial Certificate"), signed by the
Chief Financial Officer, which sets forth a good faith estimate and which
shall include reasonably detailed supporting calculations of (i) the Net
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), and the
Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus or the Estimated Net Working Capital
Deficit, as the case may be, (ii) the Company Transaction Expenses (the
"Estimated Closing Company Transaction Expenses"), and (iii) the Cash and Cash
Equivalents (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), and, in the case of (i),
calculated in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on Exhibit B

exhibit provides an illustrative calculation of Net Working Capital as of
March 31, 2017. The Company shall provide reasonable supporting detail to
evidence the Company's calculations, explanations and assumptions for the
calculation of amounts on the Closing Date Financial Certificate, it being
agreed that (x) the Company will permit the Buyers and their Representatives
to review and comment in advance on the Closing Date Financial Certificate and
(y) the Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments provided
by the Buyers on the Closing Date Financial Certificate; and

(b) a statement (the "Closing Date Indebtedness Statement"), prepared in
accordance with Exhibit D and signed by the Chief Financial Officer, which
sets forth by lender or other party a good faith estimate of the Indebtedness
and Debt-Like Items of the Group Companies outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Closing (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"). The Company shall
provide reasonable supporting detail to evidence the Company's calculations,
explanations and assumptions for the calculation of amounts on the Closing
Date Indebtedness Statement.

Section 1.4 Closing Payments. At the Closing, the Buyers shall:

(b) on behalf of the Company, pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of

and the Payoff and Release Documents, the aggregate amount of the Payoff
Indebtedness;

(c) pay or cause to be paid to the Escrow Agent, for deposit in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, the Indemnity Amount, which shall be held by the Escrow Agent
subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the
applicable provisions of this Agreement; and

(d) pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as the Sellers specify to the
Buyers in accordance with written instructions delivered by the Sellers to the
Buyers at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Closing
Cash Payment.

Section 1.5 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall prepare
and deliver to the Sellers a statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement"),
which sets forth the Buyers' good faith calculation of, and which shall
include reasonably detailed supporting calculations of, (i) the Net Working
Capital, calculated in accordance with the Working Capital Rules and presented
consistent with Exhibit C (the "Closing Net Working Capital"), (ii) the amount
of Indebtedness and Debt-Like Items of the Group Companies outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Indebtedness"), prepared in
accordance with Exhibit D, (iii) the Company Transaction Expenses (the
"Closing Company Transaction Expenses"), and (iv) the Cash and Cash
Equivalents (the "Closing Cash"). If the Buyers fail to produce the
Preliminary Closing Statement within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
then the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Closing
Cash prepared by the Company shall become final and binding. Purchase
accounting or other adjustments arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be considered for
purposes of determining the Preliminary Closing Statement. The Preliminary
Closing Statement shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
immediately prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision, change in circumstance, development or event arising or occurring on
or after the Closing.

(b) The Preliminary Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement
and become final and binding upon the Parties hereto on the date that is
forty-five (45) days following the date on which the Preliminary Closing
Statement was received by the Sellers, unless prior to such date the Sellers
deliver to the Buyers written notice of the Sellers' disagreement with any
item (each item, a "Disputed Item" and collectively, the "Disputed Items")
contained in the Preliminary Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the item, amount and basis for each Disputed Item (a
"Notice of Disagreement"). During the forty-five (45) day period following the
Sellers' receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Buyers shall after
reasonable advance notice by the Sellers (i) permit the Sellers and their
accountants to consult with the Company and the Buyers' accountants during
normal business hours, and (ii) provide to the Sellers and their accountants
under reasonable circumstances a copy of the relevant books and records
(including 

those of the Buyers' accountants subject to the execution of appropriate
agreements with the Buyers' accountants) relating to the preparation of the
Preliminary Closing Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to the
Buyers, then the Preliminary Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
clause (A) or (B) below) shall become the Final Closing Statement and become
final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of the date (A) on which the
Sellers and the Buyers resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the Disputed Items specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (B)
all Disputed Items are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with Section 1.5(c). During the thirty (30) days following the
delivery to the Buyers of a Notice of Disagreement, the Buyers and the Sellers
shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the Disputed Items specified in the Notice of Disagreement. Any
such Disputed Item resolved in writing by the Buyers and the Sellers during
the thirty (30) days following the delivery to the Buyers of a Notice of
Disagreement shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If the Buyers and
the Sellers are able to resolve in writing all of the Disputed Items set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days following the delivery
to the Buyers of such Notice of Disagreement, then the Final Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of the Buyers and the
Sellers.

(c) If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to resolve the disputed items set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days following the
delivery to the Buyers of such Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers and the
Buyers shall submit such dispute to be resolved by (x) Grant Thornton or (y)
in the event such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to take such
assignment, a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by the Buyers and the Sellers (the "Accounting Firm"). The Buyers
and the Sellers shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution
all Disputed Items (but only such Disputed Items) that are set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement which remain in dispute. The Buyers and the Sellers
shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one of its partners experienced
in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a final determination of the Net
Working Capital, the outstanding amounts of Indebtedness and Debt-Like Items
as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company Transaction Expenses and
the Cash and Cash Equivalents calculated with reference to the items that are
in dispute as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. In resolving the items
in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute and in determining the
Net Working Capital, the outstanding amounts of Indebtedness and Debt-Like
Items of the Group Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company Transaction Expenses and the Cash and Cash Equivalents, the Accounting
Firm shall (i) not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater
than the greatest value for such item assigned by the Buyers, on the one hand,
or the Sellers, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for
such item assigned by the Buyers, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the
other hand, (ii) make a final determination of the Disputed Items in
accordance with the provisions, the guidelines and the procedures set forth in
this Agreement, (iii) act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (iv) render a
final resolution in writing to the Buyers and the Sellers (which final
resolution shall be requested by the Buyers and the Sellers to be delivered
not more than thirty (30) days following submission of such Disputed Items to
the Accounting Firm or such longer period as the Accounting Firm may
reasonably require), which, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties with respect to the Net Working Capital, the
outstanding amounts of Indebtedness and Debt-Like Items of the Group Companies
as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company Transaction Expenses and
the Cash and Cash Equivalents, and (v) not 

engage in independent factual investigation, not hear evidence from either the
Buyers or the Sellers outside the presence of both the Buyers and the Sellers,
and not engage in ex parte communications with the Buyers or the Sellers. The
fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by (A) the Buyers
in the proportion that the aggregate dollar value of the Disputed Items
submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by the
Buyers bears to the aggregate value of all such items so disputed and (B) the
Sellers in the proportion that the aggregate dollar value of the Disputed
Items submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by the
Sellers bears to the aggregate value of all such items so disputed.

(d) The Preliminary Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the
Parties or at the direction of the Accounting Firm, as applicable) shall be
deemed final and binding upon the Parties hereto and shall become the Final
Closing Statement for the purposes of this Section 1.5 upon the earliest of
the (i) failure of the Sellers to notify the Buyers of a dispute within forty-
five (45) days after delivery to the Sellers of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, (ii) resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 1.5(b), by the
Buyers and the Sellers, or (iii) resolution of all remaining disputes,
pursuant to Section 1.5(c), by the Accounting Firm.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement:

(i) if there is a Final Deficit, then the Sellers shall pay an amount equal to
such Final Deficit to the Buyers in accordance with Section 1.5(f); and

(ii) if there is a Final Surplus, then the Buyers shall pay an amount equal to
such Final Surplus to the Sellers in accordance with Section 1.5(f).

(f) All payments required under this Section 1.5 shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as shall be
designated in writing by the recipient(s).

(g) The Parties acknowledge the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 are
not intended to permit the introduction of accounting methods, policies,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies in
connection with the determination of Net Working Capital other than as
required by the Working Capital Rules.

Section 1.6 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Buyers shall be entitled to withhold from any amount otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld
under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. In the event that
the Buyers determine that withholding is required under applicable Law with
regard to amounts otherwise payable to the Sellers under this Agreement, the
Buyers shall promptly notify the Sellers of such withholding obligation and
the Buyers shall work in good faith with the Sellers to avoid the application
of any such withholding obligation. In connection with any payments to be made
by the Buyers pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and Section 1.4(b), to the extent
such payments are made to non-U.S. Persons, the 

Company shall deliver to the Buyers reasonably in advance of the Closing Date
any necessary Tax forms as required under the Code or any local, state or
foreign Tax Laws to establish the appropriate withholding Taxes (if any) and
Tax reporting required in connection with such payments.

of Delaware, and (b) has all requisite general partnership power and general
partnership authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
in all material respects its businesses as owned or conducted on the date
hereof. The Company is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business as a foreign entity under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business, or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets, makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure of such qualification, license or registration would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 2.2 Authorization. The Company has all requisite general partnership
power and general partnership authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Company Ancillary Documents, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Company Ancillary Documents, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary
general partnership action on the part of the Company, and no other general
partnership action or proceeding on the part of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or the Sellers is required to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance hereof and thereof by the Company, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles and the discretion
of courts in granting equitable remedies, (a) this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
Parties, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, and (b) as of
the Closing Date, the Company Ancillary Documents shall be duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that such Company
Ancillary Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
other parties thereto, shall constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms.

Section 2.3 Capitalization of the Company. As of the date hereof, the
Interests constitute all the Equity Interests of the Company, and as of the
Closing the Interests shall constitute all of the Equity Interests of the
Company. The Interests are held of record by the Sellers in the respective
amounts set forth on Schedule 2.3, free and clear of Liens other than
Permitted Liens. 

Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3, the Company has no Equity Interests or
securities containing any equity features authorized, issued or outstanding,
and there are no agreements, options, warrants or other rights or arrangements
existing or outstanding which provide for the sale or issuance of any of the
foregoing by the Company. Except for the Interests, there are no outstanding
(i) Equity Interests or voting securities of the Company, (ii) securities
convertible or exchangeable into Equity Interests of the Company, (iii)
options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights, preemptive rights,
conversion rights, exchange rights, calls, puts, rights of first refusal or
other Contracts that require the Company to issue, sell or otherwise cause to
become outstanding or to acquire, repurchase or redeem Equity Interests of the
Company or (iv) stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or
similar rights with respect to the Company. All of the outstanding Interests
of the Company have been duly authorized. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3,
there are no preemptive or subscription rights or other similar rights in
respect of the Interests and there are no Liens (other than Permitted Liens)
on, or voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other contractual
obligations relating to, the ownership, transfer or voting of the Interests.
There is no contractual obligation, or provision in the organizational
documents of the Company which requires the Company to issue, sell, redeem or
otherwise acquire, or make any payment (including any dividend or
distribution) in respect of, the Interests.

Section 2.4 Company Subsidiaries.

(a) Schedule 2.4 sets forth a true and complete list of the name, jurisdiction
of organization, authorized capitalization, the number of type of all issued
and outstanding capital stock or other equity securities and the current
ownership of all issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity
securities of each Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4,
there are no contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound to (i)
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the capital stock or
other equity securities of any Company Subsidiary or (ii) vote or dispose of
any shares of the capital stock or other equity securities of any Company
Subsidiary.

(b) Each Company Subsidiary (i) is a duly organized and validly existing

the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and (ii) has all requisite
corporate, partnership or limited liability company authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on in all material respects its
businesses as owned or conducted on the date hereof. Each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business as a foreign
entity under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business, or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets,
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure of such
qualification, license or registration would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(c), (i) all of the outstanding Equity
Interests of each Company Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned by the Company,

registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Entity or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consents identified on Schedule 5.2(a); provided that this
Section 5.2(a) shall not require any Party to make 

any payment (other than Ordinary Course payments required to be made under an
existing Contract) or concession to any Governmental Entity or other third
party except as expressly contemplated by the other provisions of this
Agreement. The Buyers shall be responsible for and pay one hundred percent
(100%) of the filing fees associated with any of the notifications, consents,
approvals or filings with Governmental Entities pursuant to this Section
5.2(a).

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Buyers
and the Company and their respective Affiliates shall make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof. The Buyers shall be responsible for and
pay one hundred percent (100%) of the filing fees associated with such filing.
Each of the Buyers and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division
for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests
received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in
connection with antitrust, competition, trade regulation or similar matters,
and (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other Party.

(c) Subject to the last two sentences of this Section 5.2(c), the Buyers agree
to, and agree to cause their Affiliates and representatives to, use their
reasonable best efforts and to take promptly any and all steps and actions
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to
occur expeditiously, but in any event prior to the Outside Date, including, as
applicable, (i) providing information to such Persons and (ii) proposing,
negotiating, committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divesture or disposition of, or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), such of their
and their Affiliates' assets, properties and businesses and of the assets,
properties and businesses of the Group Companies, (B) the termination,
modification or extension of existing relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of them, their Affiliates or the Group Companies, (C) the
establishment or creation of relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of them, their Affiliates or the Group Companies, (D) the
termination of any relevant venture or other arrangement and (E) any other
change or restructuring of the Buyers, their Affiliates or the Group
Companies, in each case, as may be required to be taken in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any litigation,
which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or that would make the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby unlawful. In addition,
the Buyers shall oppose, through and including litigation on the merits (and
all appeals with respect thereto), any claim asserted in court or other forum
by any Governmental Entity or other Person in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would restrain or prevent the Closing prior to
the Outside Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall require (or be deemed to
require) the Buyers or any of their 

Affiliates to agree to or take any action with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 5.2 that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or result of operations of the Buyers or their Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Group Companies), taken as a whole. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyers and their Affiliates shall not be required (and
the Buyers shall not require the Group Companies to, and the Group Companies
shall not be required to), take any action with respect to any order or any
applicable Law which is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each Party shall (i) promptly notify the other Parties of any written
communication relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
that Party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or
any other Governmental Entity and, subject to Law, permit the other Parties to
review in advance any proposed written communication relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any of the foregoing and
incorporate the other Parties' reasonable comments, (ii) not participate in or
agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning any antitrust, competition or trade regulation matters in
connection with this Agreement unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat and (iii)
furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members or their respective staffs, on
the other hand, with respect to any antitrust, competition or trade regulation
matters in connection with this Agreement, except that any materials
concerning the Company's valuation of the transaction, the Company's internal
financial information or competitively sensitive information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries may be redacted or limited to outside counsel pursuant to
any applicable joint defense or common interest agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Buyers agree that, at any time in an investigation, if a
Governmental Entity suggests or proffers a settlement of the investigation to
permit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, the
Buyers shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days)
communicate the terms of the offer to the Company.

(e) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement and, subject to the
Buyers promptly providing all information reasonably requested by the Sellers
that is required to complete all notifications set forth on Schedule 5.2(e),
no later than twenty (20) Business Days from and after the date hereof, the
Company shall provide all notifications required to be made prior to the
Closing pursuant to Federal and State Health Care Laws to the appropriate
state agencies with respect to licenses and registrations of the Company,
including the notifications set forth on Schedule 5.2(e). The Company shall
promptly deliver to the Buyers complete and accurate copies of all such
notifications and all notices, correspondence and other written communication
received by the Company with respect to such notifications. The Company shall
consult with the Buyers regarding the strategy and process to respond to any
such notices, correspondence or other written communication received from a
state agency and, prior to the submission thereof, provide the Buyers with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on the response or any additional material
proposed to be submitted by the Company to the state agency. The Buyers shall
be responsible for and pay one 

hundred percent (100%) of the filing fees associated with any of the
notifications to state agencies pursuant to this Section 5.2(e).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, the Sellers, the Company and the Buyers
shall cooperate in good faith to identify any Licenses required by Law to
carry on the business and operations of the Group Companies that are not
currently held by the Group Companies (the "Additional Licenses"). From the
date hereof until the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Additional Licenses at the Sellers' sole
cost and expense.

Section 5.3 Release of Liens. The Company shall cause all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) securing the Payoff Indebtedness to be released prior to the
Closing or substantially simultaneously with the Closing.

Section 5.4 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise required by Law or the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or the rules of
any stock exchange or national market system (in which event the Parties shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to consult with each other in advance and
provide the non-disclosing Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such disclosure), none of the Parties shall, and each Party
shall cause its Affiliates not to, make or issue any public announcement,
press release to the general public or public statement or comment in response
to any inquiry made with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

Section 5.5 Supplemental Disclosure.

(a) The Company may, from time to time prior to the date falling five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, supplement, amend or add a Schedule with a corresponding
reference to be added to this Agreement (each, a "Supplement") to add new
information that arises out of or relates to facts or conditions that did not
exist as of the date of this Agreement. The delivery of any Supplement
pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) will not cure any breach that otherwise might
exist or come to exist hereunder by reason of such matters reflected in any
Supplement; provided, that if (i) the Closing occurs or (ii) the Buyers do
not, within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of any Supplement, give
notice to the Sellers that such Supplement constitutes a breach of this
Agreement that, if not cured, would enable the Buyers to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (and that in the absence of a cure the
Buyers would intend to terminate this Agreement), then any such Supplement
will be effective to cure and correct for purposes of Section 6.3(a) and
Section 9.1(a) any breach as of the Closing Date of any representation or
warranty (other than a breach as of the Closing Date of a Fundamental
Representation) that would have existed if the Company had not made such
Supplement, and, solely for purposes of determining whether a breach of any
representation or warranty (other than a breach of a Fundamental
Representation) has occurred, all references to any Schedule hereto that is
supplemented, amended or added as provided in this Section 5.5(a) shall after
the Closing be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as so supplemented,
amended or added. 

(b) The Company shall, from time to time prior to the date falling five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Supplement a Schedule if the Company becomes aware of any fact
or condition that occurred prior to the date of this Agreement and that would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules (each, an
"Existing Condition"). The delivery of any Supplement pursuant to this Section
5.5(b) will not cure any breach that otherwise might exist or come to exist
hereunder by reason of such matters reflected in any such Supplement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any breach by the
Company of this Section 5.5(b) shall be deemed for all purposes (including for
purposes of Article IX) to constitute a breach of the applicable
representation and warranty to which any such Existing Condition relates and
shall not constitute a breach of covenant.

Section 5.6 Tax Matters.

(a) The Buyers and the Company shall (but subject to Section 5.6(g)) prepare
or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns of the Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than
Straddle Periods) that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall reimburse the Buyers for any third-party costs actually incurred
in connection with such preparation and filing, promptly upon the Buyers'
delivery of an invoice or similar statement for such costs. Subject to Section
5.6(b), the Company shall prepare any such Tax Return in a manner consistent
with past practice except as required by Law, and shall provide to the Sellers
a draft of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return, taking into account any extensions. No later than
fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Sellers of such Tax Return, the Sellers
shall notify the Buyers and the Company of the existence of any objection the
Sellers may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return. If, after
consulting in good faith, the Sellers and the Company are unable to resolve
such objection(s) in a mutually agreeable manner, such objection(s) shall be
referred to the Accounting Firm for resolution, the costs of which shall be
borne by the Party whose position loses, or equitably allocated amongst the
Parties based on whose positions do not prevail as determined by the
Accounting Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall be
responsible for a portion of the costs of the Accounting Firm in the event,
and to the extent, of a determination by the Accounting Firm to the effect
that any computations relating to Taxes in the statements delivered pursuant
to Section 1.3 were in error. To the extent necessary, the Buyers and the
Company shall cause any such Tax Returns, as finally agreed upon or as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm, to be filed in a timely manner (taking into
account all extensions). All Tax Returns relating to a Straddle Period shall
be prepared and timely filed by the Buyers, and the Sellers shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such Tax Returns. The
Buyers shall prepare any such Straddle Period Tax Return in a manner
consistent with past practice except as required by Law, and shall provide to
the Sellers a draft of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Return, taking into account any extensions. No
later than fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Sellers of such Tax Return,
the Sellers shall notify the Buyers of the existence of any objection the
Sellers may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return. If, after
consulting in good faith, the Sellers and the Buyers are unable to resolve
such objection(s) in a mutually agreeable manner, such objection(s) shall be
referred to the Accounting Firm for resolution, the costs of which shall be
borne by the Party whose position loses, or equitably allocated amongst 

the Parties based on whose positions do not prevail as determined by the
Accounting Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall be
responsible for a portion of the costs of the Accounting Firm in the event,
and to the extent, of a determination by the Accounting Firm to the effect
that any computations relating to Taxes in the statements delivered pursuant
to Section 1.3 were in error. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due date of any Taxes shown as due on the Tax Returns described in this
clause (a) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers shall pay the
Buyers such amounts (without duplication for any amounts taken into account as
a component of Net Working Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness, Debt-Like Items or otherwise as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price under Article I) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and if any such payment is not made, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may make a claim for any such amounts pursuant to Article IX of this
Agreement. With respect to any Straddle Periods, the Sellers' obligations
shall be governed by Section 5.6(b) such that Sellers are only obligated to
pay the Taxes allocated to the portion of the taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date.

(b) The Parties agree that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law
the income Tax Returns for the Group Companies for the period ending on the
Closing Date (the "Company Short Year Income Tax Returns") shall include all
of the income, deductions and credits for all of the activities of the Group
Companies through the end of the tax year of the Group Companies ending on the
Closing Date, in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76. In connection therewith, for the avoidance of doubt, no election
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) shall be made. If
permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall make an election to treat 70%
of any success-based fees that were paid by or on behalf of the Company as an
amount that did not facilitate the merger and therefore as deductible in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with
Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746. If none of the Group Companies is
able to utilize any deductions reflected on the Company Short Year Income Tax
Return or any applicable Straddle Tax Return due to the lack of sufficient
taxable income for such taxable year ending on the Closing Date, the Company
shall carry back any losses reflected on the applicable Company Short Year
Income Tax Return or any applicable Straddle Tax Return to prior taxable years
to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Such carry-back shall be made as
promptly as practicable as permitted under applicable Law (including using IRS
Form 4466 and/or IRS Form 1139, as applicable). Any such Tax refunds shall be
promptly remitted to the Sellers, except to the extent any such refunds were
already taken into account as a component of Net Working Capital, Cash and
Cash Equivalents, or otherwise expressly treated pursuant to the terms hereof
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Article I (in which case only the
refunds in excess of such amounts shall be remitted to the Sellers). For the
avoidance of doubt, any such carry-back (and any Tax Returns or related forms
required in order to effectuate such carry-back shall be treated as a Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period subject to the provisions of Section
5.6(a). The allocation of Taxes for any taxable period of any Group Company
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period")
shall be determined (i) in the case of any Taxes based on or measured by
income or receipts, sales Tax, use Tax, withholding Tax, payroll Tax or
employment Tax by closing the books of such Group Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purposes, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which such Group Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes, by multiplying such Taxes by a fraction 

the numerator of which is the number of days from the beginning of such
taxable period through the close of business on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such taxable period.

(c) Tax Claims.

(i) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Agreement, then such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice, and in any
event, notice within five (5) days of becoming aware of such claim, to the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim and of any counterclaim the
indemnified party proposes to assert (a "Tax Claim"); provided, however, the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. With respect to any Tax Claim relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, subject to Section 5.6(c)(ii), the Sellers shall,
solely at their own cost and expense, control all proceedings and may make all
decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in their
sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not
settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Buyers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the Buyers, solely
at their own cost and expense, and counsel of their own choosing, shall have
the right to participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of
such Tax Claim if they reasonably determine that such Tax Claim could have a
material adverse impact on the Taxes of any of the Group Companies in a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. At the
request of the Sellers, and at the Sellers' expense, the Company shall provide
Sellers with assistance, information and documentation as may be reasonably
requested in connection with a Tax Claim.

(ii) The Sellers and the Buyers shall jointly control and participate in all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of any of
the Group Companies for a Straddle Period, and shall bear their own respective
costs and expenses. Neither the Sellers nor the Buyers shall settle any such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iii) With respect to any Tax Claim that the Sellers elect not to control
pursuant to clause (i), the Buyers shall control all such proceedings. The
Buyers shall not settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
the Sellers, solely at their own cost and expense, and counsel of their own
choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim. The Buyers shall have a right to
settle any such Tax Claim without the consent of the Sellers if the Sellers
unreasonably delay consent 

in a manner that is reasonably likely to result in additional adverse Tax
consequences to the Buyers after the Closing.

(iv) This Section 5.6(c), and not Section 9.3, shall be controlling with
respect to any Tax Claims.

(d) Except to the extent included in Current Assets in Net Working Capital as
finally determined hereunder, or as a component of Net Working Capital, Cash
and Cash Equivalents, or otherwise expressly treated pursuant to the terms
hereof as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Article I, and without
duplication for any Tax refunds determined and paid pursuant to Section
5.6(b), any Tax refund or credit (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) that is received by the Buyers, any Group Company or any of
their Affiliates shall be the property of the Sellers to the extent such
refund or credit is attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a
refund attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute from a taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Any such Tax refund or
credit that is received by the Buyers, any Group Company or any of their
Affiliates, net of any Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, shall be
promptly paid over to the Sellers. In the event that any such refund or credit
is subsequently disallowed, the Sellers shall promptly repay to the Buyers the
amount of any payment (together with any interest or penalty imposed as a
result of such disallowance, together with any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith) previously paid by the Buyers to
the Sellers. At the request of the Sellers, the Buyers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such Tax refund or credit attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Sellers shall reimburse the Buyers for any
reasonable third-party costs incurred in connection with a claim for such
refunds requested by the Sellers.

(e) From and after the Closing through the close of business on the Closing
Date, the Buyers shall not, and shall cause the Group Companies not to, take
any action outside of the Ordinary Course which would affect any item included
in Net Working Capital or otherwise would result in any adjustment to Purchase
Price under Article I, in either case which relates to Tax or Taxes.

(f) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause the Group
Companies not to, without the prior written consent of the Sellers, (i) file
any amended Tax Returns that may affect Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise affect the
liability of the Sellers, except as required by Law, or (ii) initiate or enter
into any voluntary disclosure agreement or program with any taxing authority
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(g) The Buyers shall not make or permit to be made any election under Section
338(g) of the Code or under Section 336 of the Code, or any similar provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Law, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(h) The Sellers and the Buyers shall each, at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting party (solely to the extent that third party expenses are
incurred), (i) provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by either of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return (including, for the avoidance of doubt, assistance by the Sellers 

following the Closing with respect to any Tax Returns that the Buyers and the
Company are required to prepare hereunder), audit or other examination by any
Governmental Entity responsible for the administration of Tax, or Tax audits
or actions relating to Taxes, (ii) retain and provide the other with any
records or other information which may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit
or examination, or action, and (iii) provide the other with any final
determination of any such audit or examination, action or determination that
affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other for any
relevant period.

(i) The Sellers shall deliver to the Buyers a duly executed and acknowledged
certificate, in form and substance acceptable to Buyers and in compliance with
the Code and Treasury Regulations, certifying such facts as to establish that
the sale of the Interests and any other transactions contemplated hereby are
exempt from withholding pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

(j) The Sellers shall cause all Tax allocation agreements or Tax sharing
agreements as between any of the Group Companies and the Sellers to be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and shall ensure that such agreements are
of no further force or effect as to any of the Group Companies on and after
the Closing Date and that there shall be no further liabilities or obligations
imposed on any of the Group Companies under any such agreements.

(k) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar non-income Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be allocated one hundred
percent (100%) to the Buyers. The Buyers will file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and any expenses incurred
in connection with such filings shall be allocated equally to the Buyers and
the Sellers under this Section 5.6(k).

(l) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Buyers agree that they
shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, (i) preserve and keep the
records applicable to pre-Closing periods (including all Tax and accounting
records) of the Group Companies for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing, or for any longer periods as may be required by any Governmental
Entity or ongoing litigation, and (ii) make such records available to the
Sellers as may be reasonably required by the Sellers. If the Buyers, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary wishes to destroy such records after the
time specified above, the Buyers shall first give sixty (60) days' prior
written notice to the Sellers, and the Sellers shall have the right at their
respective option and expense, upon prior written notice given to the Buyers
within that sixty (60)-day period, to take possession of the records within
ninety (90) days after the date of the Sellers' notice to the Buyers.

Section 5.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyers agree to ensure that all rights to
indemnification existing as of the date hereof in favor of any individual who,
at or prior to the Closing, was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively,
with such individual's heirs, executors 

or administrators, the "Indemnified DandO Persons") as provided in the
respective governing documents and indemnification agreements to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or bound, shall survive
the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Closing and indemnification agreements and the provisions
with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability set forth in such
governing documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified;
provided, that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within
such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such
claims. The Buyers shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
judgment in any such claim without the written consent of such Indemnified DandO
Person.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company or the Sellers shall
purchase, and maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter, (i)
a tail policy to the current policy of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained with respect to the Company, which tail policy shall be
effective for a period from the Closing through and including the date six (6)
years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Closing, and which tail policy shall
contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently
provided by such current policy and shall provide coverage for all Indemnified
DandO Persons and (ii) "run off" coverage as provided by the fiduciary and
employee benefit policies maintained with respect to the Company, in each
case, covering those Persons who are covered on the date hereof by such
policies and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the existing
policies maintained with respect to the Company. The amount paid by the
Company or the Sellers under this Section 5.7(b) shall be referred to as the
"Tail Premium." On or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyers and the Company
shall work together to obtain tail policies to the current fiduciary
liability, medical professions liability, information security and privacy,
and forefront portfolio insurance policies, at the Buyers' sole cost and
expense.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of the Buyers
contained in this Section 5.7 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns
of the Buyers. In the event the Buyers or the Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the Buyers or the Company, as
the case may be, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Buyers or the Company expressly assume the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

(d) The Company shall be a full indemnitor of first resort and, solely to the
extent of the rights of indemnification existing as of the date hereof in
favor of the Indemnified DandO Persons, shall (i) be required to advance the
full amount of all attorneys' fees, expert fees, arbitrator and mediator fees,
and all other reasonable costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred by an
Indemnified DandO Person in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or otherwise participating in (including on appeal) any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, inquiry, suit or proceeding, whether
criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising out or
relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of any
of the Group 

Companies and arising out of or relating to acts or omissions occurring or
existing at or prior to the Closing (including in respect of acts or omissions
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) (a
"DandO Indemnifiable Claim") and (ii) be liable for the full amount of all
losses, claims, damages, judgments and amounts paid in settlement in respect
of any DandO Indemnifiable Claim to the extent legally permitted and as
required, in each case without regard to any rights an Indemnified DandO Person
may have against the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or otherwise or any
insurer providing insurance coverage under an insurance policy issued to the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

(e) The obligations of the Buyers and the Company under this Section 5.7 shall
survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to affect adversely any Indemnified DandO Person to whom this Section 5.7
applies without the written consent of such affected Indemnified DandO Person
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified DandO Persons to whom this
Section 5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.7).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers.

Section 5.8 Release.

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (other than the Advent Portfolio Companies) and each of their
respective representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Releasing Parties"), shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever
discharged the Buyers and the Group Companies and each of their respective
Related Parties, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Company Released Parties") of and from, and agrees not to bring suit or claim
or seek to recover any amount with respect to, any and all claims, liabilities
and obligations of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising out of, relating to,
or resulting from any matter or cause whatsoever arising prior to the date
hereof or the Closing, whether in its capacity as an equity holder of the
Group Companies or otherwise, in each case whether known or unknown, absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and whether arising under any
agreement or understanding or otherwise, at Law or equity that the Seller
Releasing Parties, or any of them, now have, ever had, or at the Closing may
have, or hereafter can, shall or may have, against the Company Released
Parties, or any of them, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever, from the beginning of time through the Closing, except for any
claims, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Documents or from any claims, liabilities or obligations under
agreements stated to survive pursuant to Section 5.11.

(b) Effective upon the Closing, each of the Buyers and the Group Companies on
behalf of itself and its respective representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Company Releasing Parties" and, together with the Seller
Releasing Parties, each, a "Releasing Party" and collectively the "Releasing
Parties"), shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged
the Sellers and each of their respective Related Parties (other than the
Advent Portfolio Companies), representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Released 

Parties" and, together with the Company Released Parties, each, a "Released
Party" and collectively the "Released Parties") of and from, and agrees not to
bring suit or claim or seek to recover any amount with respect to, any and all
claims, liabilities and obligations of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising

Released Parties, or any of them, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause
or thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time through the Closing, except
for any claims, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Documents or from any claims, liabilities or obligations under
agreements stated to survive pursuant to Section 5.11.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Released Party and each such Person's
heirs, representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that
such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8, and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to
indemnification or contribution that any such Released Party may have under
this Agreement, by contract or otherwise.

Section 5.9 Access to Information; Cooperation.

(a) The Company will permit and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to
permit, Representatives of the Buyers to have reasonable access at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of the Group Companies, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and
documents of or pertaining to each of the Group Companies. The Buyers will
treat and hold any confidential information they receive from the Sellers, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.9(a) shall require the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to provide any access, or to disclose any
information if, in the opinion of the Company's outside counsel, providing
such access or disclosing such information would (i) violate any Law
(including antitrust or privacy laws) or (ii) jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege and such privilege cannot be protected by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries through exercise of its reasonable efforts. The Buyers shall have
no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or
facilities of the Group Companies without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent may be withheld for any reason).

(b) Within twenty (20) days following the end of each calendar month, the
Company shall provide to the Buyers a consolidated balance sheet and income
statement for the month then ended and (if applicable) the fiscal quarter then
ended, prepared in accordance with IFRS applied on a basis consistent with the
Financial Statements (except as otherwise noted therein and subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of notes).

Section 5.10 Exclusivity. The Company and the Sellers agree that between the
date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of
this Agreement, the 

Company and the Sellers shall not, and shall take all action necessary to
cause their Affiliates and any of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to (a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept
any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or (b)
participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage the submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Sellers
and the Company immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
The Company shall notify the Buyers promptly, but in any event within seventy-
two (72) hours, orally and in writing if any such Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any
such notice to the Buyers shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other contact and the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other contact.
The Sellers and the Company shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not
to, release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company, the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates is a party, without the prior written consent of the Buyers.

Section 5.11 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements. All agreements between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of their
respective Affiliates (other than arms-length agreements with the Advent
Portfolio Companies), on the other hand, other than (a) the agreements listed
on Schedule 5.11, and (b) agreements and transactions solely between the
Company and one or more of the Company Subsidiaries or between or among any
Company Subsidiaries, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and all
obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied.

Section 5.12 Employee Benefits.

(a) Unless the Buyers request otherwise in writing, the Sellers shall adopt
resolutions as general partners of the Company, and the Sellers and the
Company shall take any other required actions to terminate, effective no later
than the day prior to the Closing Date, any Company Benefit Plan which is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and which is
sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or any Group Companies (each, a
"401(k) Plan"). At the Closing, the Company shall provide to the Buyers (i)
executed resolutions of the Sellers as general partners of the Company
authorizing such termination, and (ii) an executed amendment to the 401(k)
Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k)
Plan will continue to be maintained at the time of termination.

(b) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Company
to, provide each employee and officer of the Group Companies who is employed
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee") with (i) base
salary or wage level and bonus opportunity (but excluding equity-based
compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate as provided to
each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing (based on the
compensation 

data provided by the Sellers to the Buyers prior to the date hereof), (ii) a
severance policy that is at least as favorable in the aggregate as provided to
each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, as described
in Schedule 5.12 and (iii) employee benefits that are at least as favorable in
the aggregate as the employee benefits that each such Continuing Employee was
entitled to receive immediately prior to the Closing (except as set forth on
Schedule 5.12(b)).

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits,
including the determination of the level of vacation and severance pay
benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of the Buyers, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing (the "Buyer Plans"), the Buyers and the Company shall
credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same
extent as such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan, (other than
for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan),
except where such crediting would result in duplication of benefits. The Buyer
Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-
existing conditions to the extent such conditions were waived or satisfied
under similar Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing and shall
credit such Continuing Employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses in the applicable plan year to which such deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses relate.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.12 with respect to employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the Parties and shall not
create any right (i) in any other Person, including, any employee, former
employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Benefit
Plan or Buyer Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or the Buyers. Nothing contained in this Section
5.12 is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption
of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Buyers nor shall it interfere with the
Buyers', the Company's or any of their Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan (subject to the terms of such Company
Benefit Plan) or to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries for any reason.

Section 5.13 Confidentiality. From the date hereof until the three (3) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, each Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, hold and continue to hold in strict
confidence, and not utilize in its or their respective business, all
information and documents concerning any other Party or any of its Affiliates
("Confidential Information"), except where such disclosure is expressly
consented to in advance in writing by such Party (in its sole and absolute
discretion) or where disclosure may be necessary for such Party (1) to enforce
its rights under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or
entered into in connection herewith, or (2) as may be permitted under this
Agreement or any such other agreement or as may be expressly permitted under
any other written agreement among the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the following will not constitute "Confidential Information" for purposes of
this Agreement: (a) information that is or becomes generally available to the
public 

other than as the result of a disclosure by the receiving Party or any
Affiliate thereof or their respective Representatives and (b) information that
the receiving Party is legally obligated to disclose pursuant to a valid
subpoena or a valid request from any Governmental Entity or by the rules and
regulations of any securities exchange or national market system, subject to
the obligation of the receiving Party to give the other Party reasonable
advance notice of such disclosure (to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Laws) and to cooperate with the other Party (at the other Party's expense) in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate means for limiting the scope
of the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing, the
foregoing restrictions in this Section 5.13 shall not apply to the use by the
Buyers of any documents or information related to the Group Companies and
included in assets of the Group Companies.

Section 5.14 OIG Consent.

(a) Within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, the Sellers
shall, or shall cause the Company to, notify the OIG and its designees of the
Parties' entry into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the notification contemplated by the Company's Corporate
Integrity Agreement (the "CIA").

(b) As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Parties shall (a) provide all
required submissions to the OIG in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and as otherwise required by the CIA and (b) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the OIG's written consent
(including in the form of an email) that the obligations set forth in the CIA
will (i) only apply to the Group Companies' business following the Closing,
(ii) not make the Buyers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies following the Closing) "Covered Persons" (as defined in the CIA)
under the CIA to the extent that such Persons are reasonably deemed by the
Group Companies (consistent with the Buyers' obligations pursuant to Section
5.14(d)) not to be furnishing patient care items or services or to be
performing billing or coding functions on behalf of the Group Companies, (iii)
not make the Buyers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Group Companies
following the Closing) "Arrangements Covered Persons" under the CIA to the
extent that such Persons are reasonably deemed by the Group Companies
(consistent with the Buyers' obligations pursuant to Section 5.14(d)) not to
be directly involved with the development, approval, management or review of
the Group Companies' "Arrangements" (as defined in the CIA), and (iv) not
require any obligations or certifications of the Buyers' or their Affiliates'
(other than the Group Companies following the Closing) board of directors (or
similar governing body), or their individual directors, managers, officers or
senior management (vice president level or higher), pursuant to sections
III.A.2, III.A.3 and/or III.A.4 of the CIA, unless such individuals are also
designated by the Buyers or the Group Companies as either members of the Group
Companies' "Compliance Committee" (as defined in the CIA), members of the
Group Companies' board of directors or "Certifying Employees" (as defined in
the CIA), in each case consistent with the Buyers' obligations pursuant to
Section 5.14(d) (in which case their service in those roles will be governed
by the terms of the CIA) (collectively, the "OIG Consent").

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the OIG may
provide that the requirements of the CIA will apply to any employees of the
Buyers and their Affiliates that meet the CIA definition of "Covered Persons"
or "Arrangements Covered Persons" 

with respect to the obligations imposed by virtue of those designations under
the CIA and the Buyers acknowledge and agree that any such provision by the
OIG shall be reasonable and not inconsistent with the criteria of the OIG
Consent.

(d) In obtaining the OIG Consent, the Buyers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts and take all commercially reasonable measures, including exercising
flexibility in establishing reporting structures, (i) to develop and offer to
the OIG (including following comments and other input from the OIG) a post-
closing structure and operational plan for the Group Companies that would
avoid or eliminate any impediments that might be asserted by the OIG with
respect to issuing the OIG Consent and (ii) to work with the OIG in ensuring
that the post-closing structure, management and integration plan, including
the identification and designation of individuals to be subject to the CIA,
result in the OIG Consent. Prior to a Party submitting any notifications,
filings or other materials described in the immediately preceding sentence to
the OIG, the submitting Party will provide copies thereof to the other Parties
for review and comment, will reasonably consider any comments received from
the other Parties thereon, and will otherwise work together in good faith with
the other Parties in connection with all such actions and communications with
the OIG. No Party may engage in ex parte communications with the OIG regarding
the OIG Consent without the prior consent of the other Parties. Each Party
shall cooperate in good faith with the other Parties, consistent with this
Section 5.14, to obtain the OIG Consent.

Section 5.15 Restrictive Covenants.

(a) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, during the Restricted Period,
neither such Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly
through any Person, as a principal, employee, partner, owner, member, officer,
director, agent, consultant or otherwise, compete with, assist in any activity
which competes with, or provide financial resources to any Person which
competes with, the Restricted Business Activities anywhere in the Restricted
Territory; provided, however, that a Seller or any of its Affiliates may
acquire up to two percent (2%) of any company whose common stock is publicly
traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market so
long as such Seller or Affiliate is not in control of, or a member of a group
which controls, such Person. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Group Companies conduct the Restricted Business Activities throughout the
Restricted Territory and that to protect adequately the interests of the
Buyers in the Group Companies, it is essential that any noncompetition
covenant with respect thereto cover all Restricted Business Activities and the
entire Restricted Territory for the duration of the Restricted Period.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or otherwise, this Section 5.15(a)
(i) shall not apply to (A) Advent International Corporation or investment
funds affiliated with Advent International Corporation (the "Advent
Investors") or (B) any portfolio company (other than the Sellers) in which any
Advent Investor has a direct or indirect equity interest (the "Advent
Portfolio Companies") and (ii) shall terminate as to Mediq Holding B.V. and
its Subsidiaries and any purchaser thereof (and the purchaser's Affiliates)
and be of no further force and effect upon the occurrence of a Seller Change
of Control.

(b) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, during the Restricted Period,
neither such Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly
through any Person as a principal, employee, partner, owner, member, officer,
director, agent, consultant or otherwise solicit, encourage 

to leave employment, recruit or hire any Restricted Employee or any person who
at the time of such solicitation, encouragement, recruiting or hiring had been
Restricted Employee within the previous twelve (12) months. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or otherwise, this Section 5.15(b) shall not apply
to the Advent Portfolio Companies; provided that none of the Sellers, their
Affiliates nor any of the Advent Investors shall cause or direct the Advent
Portfolio Companies to take any action that would otherwise be prohibited by
this Section 5.15(b).

(c) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, during the Restricted Period, such
Seller will not disparage the Buyers or the Group Companies or any of their
respective members, managers/directors, officers or employees, or any of the
Buyers' or the Group Companies' products or services in a manner that
wrongfully interferes with, disrupts or attempts to disrupt the relationship,
contractual or otherwise, between any Buyer or any Group Company and any other
Person.

(d) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements made
by such Seller in this Section 5.15 were a material inducement to the Buyers
to enter into this Agreement and to perform their obligations hereunder, and
that the Buyers would be irreparably damaged and would not obtain the benefit
of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the
Parties if such Seller breached the provisions of this Section 5.15 applicable
to such Seller. Each Seller has had the opportunity to consult with legal
counsel regarding the covenants made by such Seller pursuant to this Section
5.15 and, based on such consultation, has determined and hereby acknowledges
that such covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area of
restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Company and the
substantial investment in the Group Companies made by the Buyers hereunder.
Each Seller further acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the benefits to such
Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are sufficient
consideration to support his, her, or its agreements set forth in this Section
5.15; and (ii) the agreements set forth in this Section 5.15 are being entered
into in connection with the sale of the Group Companies to the Buyers pursuant
to this Agreement and not in connection with any employment arrangement
between such Seller and the Buyers or the Group Companies.

(e) In the event of any breach of the covenants set forth in this Section
5.15, each Seller agrees that the harm to Buyers and the Group Companies will
be irreparable and will be without adequate remedy at law and therefore that
injunctive relief with respect thereto will be appropriate in addition to any
other legal remedies available, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of legal damages or of posting a bond. Furthermore, upon any breach
of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.15, the Restricted Period will be
extended for a length of time equivalent to the period of breach (but, with
respect to Section 5.15(a), in no event beyond a Seller Change of Control). In
the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines, in an action
brought by or on behalf of the Buyers or the Group Companies that any of the
foregoing provisions are unenforceable as stated, the Parties intend that such
restrictions be modified to permit the maximum enforceable restriction on
Sellers.

Section 5.16 280G Approval. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) secure from each Person who is a Disqualified Individual and
who has the right to any payments or benefits that may, separately or in the
aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" under 

Section 280G of the Code ("280G Payments") a waiver of such Person's rights to
any such payments and benefits (the "280G Waived Benefits") so that all
remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Disqualified Individual
shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) and (b) submit to the relevant stockholders for
approval in accordance with the stockholder approval rules of Section 280G of
the Code any 280G Waived Benefits; provided, however, that any amounts or
other entitlements that could be received by any Disqualified Individual in
connection with agreements or arrangements entered into with the Buyers or
their Affiliates, whether prior to, on or after the date hereof shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining compliance with this Section 5.16
unless such agreements or arrangements (including all information required to
determine the aggregate present value of the "parachute payments" (each, as
defined in Section 280G of the Code) such person could receive thereunder)
have been provided to the Company no later than fifteen (15) Business Days
following the date hereof. All materials produced by the Company or its
advisors in connection with the stockholder vote shall be provided to the
Buyers reasonably in advance for the Buyers' review and comment, which
comments the Company shall consider in good faith and not unreasonably omit to
reflect in the final versions of such documents.

prior to the Closing:

(a) in writing, by mutual consent of the Parties;

"Terminating Company Breach") and (ii) shall not have been cured within twenty
(20) days after written notice from the Buyers of such Terminating Company
Breach is received by the Sellers (such notice to describe such Terminating

by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date; provided, that the
Buyers are not then in material breach of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or other obligations under 

this Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b);

(c) by the Sellers if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by the Buyers in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue or inaccurate after the
date of this Agreement, in each case which breach, untruth or inaccuracy (i)
would reasonably be expected to result in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) not
being satisfied as of the Closing Date (a "Terminating Buyer Breach") and (ii)
shall not have been cured within twenty (20) days after written notice from
the Sellers of such Terminating Buyer Breach is received by the Buyers (such
notice to describe such Terminating Buyer Breach in reasonable detail), or
which breach, untruth or inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the Outside Date; provided, that neither the Sellers nor the Company are then
in material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other obligations under this Agreement, which breach would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b); or

(d) by written notice by any Party if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to the Outside Date for any reason other than delay and/or nonperformance of
the Party seeking such termination.

Section 8.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 by the Buyers, on the
one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Parties specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be
terminated and become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability
hereunder on the part of the Buyers, the Guarantor, the Sellers or the
Company, except that this Section 8.2, Section 5.4 (Public Announcements) and
Article X (other than Section 10.17) shall survive any termination of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall (i) relieve or release any Party
of any liability or damages arising out of such Party's intentional and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement or (ii) impair the right of
any Party to compel specific performance by the other Party or Parties, as the
case may be, of such Party's obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1 Indemnification Obligations of the Sellers. Subject to the
provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
from, against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of or relating
to the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article II or by the Sellers in Article III or in any certificate delivered by
such Party pursuant hereto; 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking made in
this Agreement by (i) the Company that is required to be performed on or prior
to the Closing or (ii) the Sellers;

(c) any Company Transaction Expenses that remain unpaid after the Closing;

(d) any Closing Indebtedness that remains unpaid after the Closing;

(e) (i) any Taxes of the Group Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and
(ii) any and all liability (as a result of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous state or local regulation) for Taxes of a member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which a Group
Company is or was a member prior to the Closing Date or any person with whom
any Group Company otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
indemnification under this Section 9.1(e) shall not be duplicative of any
Taxes reflected in Net Working Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness or Debt-Like Items hereunder; and

(f) the items set forth on Schedule 9.1(f).

(g) the items set forth on Schedule 9.1(g).

The Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this Section 9.1 as
to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Buyer Losses".

Section 9.2 Indemnification Obligations of the Buyers. Subject to the
provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Buyers shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Seller Indemnified Parties
from, against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of or relating
to the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyers in Article
IV or in any certificate delivered by the Buyers pursuant hereto; and

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking made by
the Buyers in this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedure.

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of a notice from a third
party of a claim, dispute, or threatened or filed complaint or the threatened
or actual commencement of any audit, investigation, lawsuit, action or
proceeding (a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which such Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party
shall provide prompt written notice (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after receiving written notice of the Third Party Claim) to the Buyers or
the Sellers, whichever is the appropriate indemnifying Party hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party"); provided, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under
this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying 

Party results in (x) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and
defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
claim or (y) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of
the fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided that, prior to the
Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to
the Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be fully
responsible for all liability relating to such claim for indemnification
(subject to the limitations set forth herein) and that such Indemnifying Party
shall provide full indemnification (subject to the limitations set forth
herein) to the Indemnified Party with respect to such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to such claim for
indemnification hereunder. In any Third Party Claim with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action,
shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at such Party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are
maintaining and to cooperate fully in good faith with each other with respect
to the defense of any such matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of a Third Party
Claim (i) involving potential criminal liability, (ii) in which equitable
relief is sought against the Indemnified Party or that the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the Indemnified Party and that does not solely involve, and does not
continue to solely involve, monetary damages (other than immaterial equitable
relief or other immaterial non-monetary claims that are ancillary to a claim
for monetary damages), (iii) if the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel that an actual conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such third Person claim
and, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Indemnified Party, counsel
for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnified Party, (iv) if the Indemnified Party (if a Buyer Indemnified
Party) reasonably believes potential Losses related thereto could likely
exceed the Indemnity Amount, unless the Indemnifying Party demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnified Party that it has the capacity and
financial resources to satisfy, and will satisfy, any indemnification
obligation beyond the Deductible (if applicable) and Indemnity Amount that
arises from such Third Party Claim or (v) involving a then current customer,
supplier or employee of the Indemnified Party as an adverse party (the
conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (v) are, collectively, the
"Litigation Conditions"). To the extent the Indemnifying Party elects not, or
is not permitted under the terms hereof, to defend such proceeding, claim or
demand, or abandons or fails to diligently pursue the defense of a Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with any
such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party (to the extent the Third Party Claim is
indemnifiable pursuant to Article IX), and control the defense of such
proceeding. If (A) any of the Litigation Conditions come into existence or (B)
the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume its own
defense, and seek indemnification hereunder for all reasonable costs and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with such defense. 

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall send
written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. As
promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such
Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the
merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation
or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of
the merits and amount of such claim, (i) if the Indemnifying Party is the
Sellers, the Buyers and the Sellers shall execute joint written instructions
directing the Escrow Agent to pay from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or, if such
funds are insufficient, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers in immediately
available funds an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder, in each
case subject to the terms of this Article IX, and (ii) if the Indemnifying
Party is the Buyers, the Buyers shall pay to the Sellers in immediately
available funds an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder, in each
case subject to the terms of this Article IX.

(d) The procedures governing any claims for indemnification with respect to
Tax matters shall be governed by Section 5.6 and not this Section 9.3.

Section 9.4 Claims Period.

(a) The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate
on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. No claim
for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the Claims Period;
provided, if prior to the close of business on the last day of the Claims
Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for
indemnity hereunder (including a Third Party Claim) and such claim shall not
have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.4(a), (i) the Claims Period for any claim under
Section 9.1(a) arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.13 (Tax Returns; Taxes)
or for any claim under Section 9.1(e) shall continue until the date that is
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; (ii) the Claims Period for any claim under Section 9.1(a) arising
out of any inaccuracy or breach of the Fundamental Representations shall
continue until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations; (iii) the Claims Period for any claim under (x)
Section 9.1(a) arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in Section 2.15 (Licenses and Permits) or (y) Section
9.1(f) shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the three (3) year anniversary of
the Closing Date and (B) the date on which a Seller Change of Control occurs
but in any event no earlier than the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing
Date; (iv) the Claims Period for any claim under Section 9.1(a) arising out of
any breach of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 2.22 (Health Care Regulatory Compliance) shall terminate on the
earlier of (A) the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date 

and (B) the date on which a Seller Change of Control occurs but in any event
no earlier than the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; (v)
the Claims Period for any claim under Section 9.1(b) arising out of any breach
of any covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings to be performed
after the Closing shall terminate on the date on which such covenants,
agreements, obligations and undertakings have been fully performed in
accordance with their respective terms; and (vi) the Claims Period for any
claim of fraud with respect to the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in this Agreement shall be unlimited.

Section 9.5 Liability Limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, a Party's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, harmless under this Article IX shall be limited as follows:

(a) no amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (other
than Buyer Losses arising out of or relating to representations and warranties
of the Company contained in Section 2.13 (Tax Returns; Taxes) or Section 2.15
(Licenses and Permits) or the Fundamental Representations) or Section 9.1(g)
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties unless (i) such claim (or series of related
claims arising from the same underlying facts, event or circumstances)
involves Buyer Losses (excluding Buyer Losses described in Section 9.5(f)) in
excess of $50,000 and (ii) the aggregate of all Buyer Losses (excluding Buyer
Losses described in Section 9.5(f)) in respect of claims for indemnity
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (other than Buyer Losses arising out of or relating
to representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.13
(Tax Returns; Taxes) or Section 2.15 (Licenses and Permits) or the Fundamental
Representations) or Section 9.1(g) for which the Sellers would, but for this
Section 9.5, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis $2,000,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to recover only the amount of such Buyer Losses in excess of the Deductible;
provided, that this clause (a) shall not apply to Buyer Losses arising out of
or relating to claims of fraud with respect to the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement;

(b) any indemnification obligation of the Sellers pursuant to this Article IX
(other than obligations of the type described in Section 9.4(b)), shall be
satisfied solely from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and if the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is insufficient to satisfy any amount of any such Buyer Loss, then such
amount of such Buyer Loss shall remain unsatisfied and no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover any such shortfall from the Sellers;

(c) except in the case of any amounts of indemnity payable for Buyer Losses
arising out of or relating to the breach or inaccuracy of the Fundamental
Representations or claims of fraud with respect to the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall the
aggregate amount of all indemnity required to be paid by the Sellers pursuant
to Section 9.1 exceed the Indemnity Amount;

(d) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all indemnity required to be
paid by the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1 exceed the Purchase Price;

(e) the amount of each claim for Buyer Losses by a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 9.1 

shall be limited to, the amount of such Buyer Losses that remain after
deducting therefrom any third party insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contributions or other similar payment actually recovered from any third party
with respect thereto;

(f) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to Section 9.1 with respect to
any Buyer Loss shall be reduced (without duplication) to the extent such Buyer
Loss is reflected on the Final Closing Statement;

(g) in any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, no Party shall be
required to indemnify any Person for punitive or exemplary damages or any
other Loss that is not reasonably foreseeable (other than any such punitive or
exemplary damages or any other Loss awarded as a result of a Third Party
Claim);

(h) any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this Article IX shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss including taking any actions
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, and an Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable to the
Indemnified Party's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Indemnified Party shall be required to (i) take any action that could
reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to its reputation or its
business, taken as a whole, or (ii) commence or initiate any action or
otherwise make any claim against any then current customer or supplier of such
Indemnified Party or of any of its Affiliates;

(i) subject to Section 9.5(a), the liability of the Sellers for Buyer Losses
shall be considered in the aggregate and shall be determined on a cumulative
basis so Buyer Losses incurred under Article IX shall be combined with all
other Buyer Losses incurred under Article IX for purposes of determining
limitations on liability, including the maximum liability amounts described
above;

(j) to the extent permitted by Law, any indemnity payment or post-closing
adjustment under Section 1.5 under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

(k) for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss arising from a breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (and for
purposes of determining whether any such representation or warranty has been
breached), the determination shall be made (i) net of any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates and that are attributable
on a with and without basis to any such Losses and (ii) without regard to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, "except as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Group Companies" or similar qualifications that
may be contained therein (other than the words "Material Adverse Effect" as
used in Section 2.8(b)).

Section 9.6 Exclusive Remedies. From and after the Closing, the provisions of
this Article IX and Section 10.10 hereof set forth the exclusive rights and
remedies of the Parties to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or
relief whatsoever from any party with respect to matters arising under or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9.6 shall not operate to (a)
interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of Article I
providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating to the Purchase
Price between the Parties and/or by the Accounting Firm, (b) limit the rights
of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief pursuant to Section 10.10), (c) interfere with or impede the
operation of Section 5.6(b) (with respect to resolutions by the Accounting
Firm of objections involving Tax Returns) or Section 5.6(d), (d) limit the
rights of the Indemnified DandO Persons pursuant to Section 5.7 or (e) limit the
rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to seek or obtain damages for a breach
of Section 5.13 or Section 5.15.

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the

liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

Section 10.6 Section Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in
this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of
the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.7 Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc. Each Party hereby irrevocably
agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts
located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. During
the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this Section 10.7
is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to
such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim,
cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court. Each Party agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by US registered mail to such Party's respective address set forth in
Section 10.2 shall be effective service of process for any Legal Dispute in
the State of Delaware with respect to any matters for which it has submitted
to jurisdiction pursuant to Section 10.7. Each Party hereby waives, and shall
not assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not
subject thereto, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.16, (b) such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such
court, (c) such Party's property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such
action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or (e) the
venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper. A final judgment in any
action, suit or proceeding described in this Section 10.7 following the
expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during
appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws. EACH OF
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATING THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN
WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH
LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY SHALL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER
LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED. 

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in
entering into this Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or
assurances, written or oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality
Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction,
effect, performance and remedies.

Section 10.10 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge that the rights of
each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non‑breaching Party may have no
adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non‑breaching
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the
other Party's obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for
damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security),
including any order, injunction or decree sought by the Company and/or the
Sellers to cause the Buyers or the Guarantor to perform its agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement.

Section 10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

and the transactions contemplated hereby to such third party; provided,
