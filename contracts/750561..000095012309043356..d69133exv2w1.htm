disbursing agent (the &#147;<U>Disbursing Agent</U>&#148;) for the payment of Merger Consideration upon
surrender of certificates representing the Shares. Parent will enter into a disbursing agent
agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and at such times, and from time to time, as the Disbursing
Agent requires funds to make the payments pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.6(b)</U>, Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to make
the payments pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.6(b)</U> to holders of Shares (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). For purposes of determining the amount to
be so deposited, Merger Subsidiary shall assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect any
right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be (i)&nbsp;direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii)&nbsp;obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or (iii)&nbsp;commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moody&#146;s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
Corporation; provided further that no loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Shares pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.6(b)</U>. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under <U>Section&nbsp;3.6(b)</U> shall be promptly paid to Parent. Parent shall promptly
replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of any investment losses. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

Time, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, to each Person who was a
record holder as of the Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;), and whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;3.6(b)</U>, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of that Certificate, less any required withholding of Taxes, and such
Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates.

Parent. At any time more than twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent
shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Disbursing
Agent and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all interest and other income
received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, holders of
Certificates shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement,
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when
such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U> are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii)&nbsp;the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
a Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U> are not a penalty, but rather are a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; and (iii)&nbsp;without the agreements contained in
this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U>, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U> and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U> or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to
Parent, costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by the prevailing Party and its

liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising
out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination, provided, however, that nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(e)</U> shall preclude
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person from bringing or
maintaining any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or its Affiliates for any
termination in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.1(d)(iii)</U> arising out of any willful or
