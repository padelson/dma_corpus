 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent with (or cause Parent to be furnished with) mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall furnish Parent with such information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels, listings and files, use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , deliver to the Company all copies of such information or extracts therefrom then in their possession or under their control. 

   

 2.3 _Board Representation_. 

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law and to the extent permitted by the Stock Exchange, promptly upon the Acceptance Date, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Merger Subsidiary representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including all Shares which have been and will be accepted for payment pursuant to _Article III_) bears to the number of Shares outstanding, and upon the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors or use its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to provide Parent with such level of representation (including, if necessary, to ensure that a sufficient number of independent directors are serving on the Board of Directors of the Company in order to satisfy the Stock Exchange listing requirements) (the date on which the majority of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that have been effectively appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). Subject to applicable Law, 

   ##### 

  

   

the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage as is on the entire
Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to this _Section
2.3(a)_) to be on (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
and (ii) each Board of Directors and each committee thereof of each Subsidiary
of the Company. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to its Board
of Directors shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act. At the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly take, at
its expense, all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
under the Exchange Act in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.3(a)_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise timely
mail to its stockholders all necessary information to comply therewith.
Parent will supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, all
information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_, following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Board of Directors to have at least two (2) directors, who (i) were directors on the date hereof, (ii) are considered to be independent directors within the meaning of the Stock Exchange listing requirements and applicable Laws, and (iii) are not Affiliates, equityholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (the " _Independent Directors_ ") and at least such number of directors (including the Independent Directors) as may be required by the Stock Exchange listing requirements or applicable Laws, who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such Stock Exchange listing requirements and Laws; _provided_ that if any Independent Directors cease to be directors for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall be independent within the meaning of the Stock Exchange listing requirements and applicable Laws and shall not be an Affiliate, equityholder or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be Independent Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; provided that the remaining Independent Directors shall fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further provided that if no such Independent Directors are appointed in such time period, Parent shall designate such Independent Director(s), provided further that if no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate two (2) Persons who shall be independent within the meaning of the Stock Exchange listing requirements and applicable Laws and shall not be Affiliates, equityholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In all cases, the selection of any Independent Directors who are not directors on the date hereof shall be subject to the approval of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 (c) Following the Board Appointment Date and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1_, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary 

   ##### 

  

   

and any enforcement of or any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any action to
seek to enforce any obligations of Parent or Merger Subsidiary under this
Agreement or any other action by the Companys Board of Directors under or in
connection with this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE III. 
  _THE MERGER_  

   

 3.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (by the parties) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_, the parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger or other appropriate document (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any other Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively own at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, following the satisfaction or waiver (by the parties) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_, Parent and the Company hereby agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, without a meeting of the holders of Shares, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (d) The Merger shall have the effects specified under the DGCL. At and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

   

 3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation_. 

  

 The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Charter_ "), until amended as provided in the Surviving Charter or by applicable Law. 

  

 3.3 _Bylaws_. 

  

 The Company shall take all requisite action so that the Bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the 

   ##### 

  

    

Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Bylaws_ "), until
amended in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws or by
applicable Law. 

  

 3.4 _Directors and Officers_. 

  

 Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all requisite action so that the directors and officers of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL. 

  

 3.5 _Additional Actions_. 

  

 If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action. 

  

 3.6 _Conversion of Shares_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) each Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and outstanding Share owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled automatically and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or consideration shall be made with respect thereto; 

   

 (b) each issued and outstanding Share other than (i) Shares referred to in  _Section 3.6(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest; and 

   

 (c) each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same 

   ##### 

  

   

rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 3.7 _Surrender and Payment_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing the Shares. Parent will enter into a disbursing agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and at such times, and from time to time, as the Disbursing Agent requires funds to make the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to make the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ to holders of Shares (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For purposes of determining the amount to be so deposited, Merger Subsidiary shall assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation; provided further that no loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.6(b)_ shall be promptly paid to Parent. Parent shall promptly replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of any investment losses. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) Merger Subsidiary shall instruct the Disbursing Agent to mail promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, to each Person who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.6(b)_, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of that Certificate, less any required withholding of Taxes, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. 

   

 (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a 

   ##### 

  

   

Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.7_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, Shares held by the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Disbursing Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand by Parent. At any time more than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all interest and other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. 

   

 3.8 _Company Stock Options and Other Payments_. 

  

 (a) Except with respect to the stock options set forth on _Section 3.8(a)_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter (the " _Excepted Options_ "), the Company represents and warrants that each option to acquire Shares granted under any Company Stock Plan or any other agreement (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is not fully exercisable as of the date of this Agreement will automatically become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Acceptance Date pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan. On the 

   ##### 

  

   

Acceptance Date, each Company Stock Option other than the Excepted Options,
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
the holder of any such Company Stock Option, shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i)
the Option Consideration multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of
Shares into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date; provided, that if the exercise
price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the Offer Price, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 3.8(a)_ to the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be reduced
by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (A) the Code, (B)
any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (C) any other applicable
Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be
treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option for
all purposes under this Agreement. The Company, or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall make the payments in respect of the Company Stock
Options as promptly as practicable following the cancellation of such
Company Stock Options as contemplated by this _Section 3.8(a)_ by checks
payable to the holders of such Company Stock Options unless the aggregate
amount payable to a particular individual exceeds $200,000, in which event
payment may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
upon receipt by the Company of written payment instructions from the relevant
option holder. Upon written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause
Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund
the Companys payment obligation under this  _Section 3.8(a)_ as such
amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such written notice). The
Company shall take all requisite action so that, immediately following such
payment, each Company Stock Option shall be canceled and the applicable
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated. 

   

 (b) With respect to the Excepted Options, each Excepted Option that is not fully exercisable and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, will automatically become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Acceptance Date. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall cause each holder of an Excepted Option (i) with an exercise price that is less than the Offer Price to enter into a written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which each such Excepted Option shall be canceled on the Acceptance Date and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Option Consideration, multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of Shares into which the Excepted Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Acceptance Date (the " _Option Waiver, Cash-Out and Release Agreement_ "); and (ii) with an exercise price in excess of the Offer Price to enter into a written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, pursuant to which the aggregate number of such Excepted Options will be canceled on the Acceptance Date and converted into the right to receive a $10.00 cash payment, without interest (the " _Option Waiver, Cancellation and Release Agreement_ "). Each Optionholder who holds an Excepted Option that has been canceled or cashed-out (a " _Cancelled Company Option_ ") shall have no rights with respect to such Cancelled Company Option to receive any other consideration in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Any payments made to a holder of an Excepted Option will be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (x) the Code, (y) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws, or (z) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of a Cancelled Company Option for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may 

   ##### 

  

   

be, shall make the payments in respect of the Cancelled Company Options as
promptly as practicable following the cancellation of such Cancelled Company
Options as contemplated by this  _Section 3.8(b)_ by checks payable to the
holders of such Company Stock Options unless the aggregate amount payable to
a particular individual exceeds $200,000, in which event payment may be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon receipt by the Company of
written payment instructions from the relevant option holder. Upon written
notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the
Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys payment obligation
under this _Section 3.8(b)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set
forth in such written notice). 

   

 (c) At the earlier of (x) the Board Appointment Date or (y) the date on which Merger Subsidiary holds more than 60% of the outstanding Shares, those individuals designated by the Company in accordance with the Incentive and Retention Plan, as amended (the " _Eligible Persons_ ") shall have the right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount so designated by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Incentive and Retention Plan, as amended. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.8(c)_ to an Eligible Person shall be reduced by any income Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Eligible Person for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall make the payments pursuant to the Incentive and Retention Plan, as amended, as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Date by checks payable to the Eligible Persons unless the aggregate amount payable to a particular individual exceeds $200,000, in which event payment may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon receipt by the Company of written payment instructions from the relevant Eligible Person. Upon written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys payment obligation under this  _Section 3.8(c)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such written notice). The Company shall take all requisite action so that, immediately following such payment, the Incentive and Retention Plan shall be canceled and terminated. 

   

 (d) At the earlier of (x) the Board Appointment Date or (y) the date on which Merger Subsidiary holds more than 60% of the outstanding Shares, each employee of the Company who is not an officer or director shall, in accordance with the Companys Non-Officer Employee Severance Plan, as amended (the " _Severance Plan Eligible Employees_ ") have the right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount so designated by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Non-Officer Employee Severance Plan, as amended. Any payment made pursuant to this  _Section 3.8(d)_ to a Severance Plan Eligible Employee shall be reduced by any income Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Severance Plan Eligible Employee for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall make the payments pursuant to the Non-Officer Employee Severance Plan, as amended, as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Date by checks payable to the Severance Plan Eligible Employees. Upon written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys payment obligation under this _Section 3.8(d)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such 

   ##### 

  

   

written notice). The Company shall take all requisite action so that,
immediately following such payment, the Plan shall be canceled and
terminated. 

   

 (e) Immediately prior to the Acceptance Date (i) each Company Restricted Share shall vest in full and (ii) subject to the ultimate vesting of such Company Restricted Shares, the holder thereof shall have the right to tender (or to direct the Company to tender on his or her behalf) such Company Restricted Shares then held (net of any Shares withheld to satisfy employment and income tax obligations) into the Offer. To the extent any Shares that were formerly Company Restricted Shares are not so tendered, upon the Acceptance Date, they shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.8(e)_ to the holder of any Company Restricted Share shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (ii) any other applicable Laws. 

   

 3.9 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are held by any record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be canceled and terminated and shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting Shares other than such rights to be paid fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares as are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 3.9_, if the Merger is terminated, rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   

 3.10 _Adjustments_. 

  

 If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger 

   ##### 

  

 

Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   

 3.11 _Withholding Rights_. 

  

 Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Disbursing Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 3.12 _Lost Certificates_. 

  

 If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III_. 

  

ARTICLE IV. 
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_  

   

 Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports (excluding information set forth in any exhibit thereto and excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor section and in any section relating to forward looking statements) or in the Companys Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary as follows:

 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

  

 The Company has heretofore provided or made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company 

   #####

may withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and
this Agreement at any time if it determines in good faith, after taking into
account the advice of its legal advisors that the failure to take such action
could reasonably likely result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, subject to the Board of
Directors of the Company first providing Parent notice and opportunity to
negotiate an amendment to this Agreement in the manner provided in _Section

of 300% of the per annum rate of the aggregate annual premium currently

 (b) For all purposes under each Benefit Plan maintained by Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate upon or after the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, to the same extent as if such services had been rendered to Parent or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the

   ##### 

 

  

foregoing, such credit shall not be used to determine benefit accruals, except
with respect to severance and vacation benefits. 

   

 (c) As to the plan years then in place at the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to use all reasonable best efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit under any general leave, welfare plan or fringe benefit plan in which the Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate after the Effective Time for any co-payments and deductibles paid by and out of pocket requirements satisfied by such Continuing Employee for the then current plan year under the corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.16_ is not intended to and shall not (i) create any third party rights, (ii) amend any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) require Parent to continue any Company Benefit Plan beyond the time when it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or modified, or (iv) provide any Continuing Employee with any rights to continued employment, severance pay or similar benefits following any termination of employment.

 As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each issued and outstanding option and Company Restricted Share granted under the Company Stock Plans to be amended to permit the acceleration and vesting of such options and Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Acceptance Date as provided in _Section 3.8_ hereof to the extent such options and Company Restricted Shares do not permit such treatment; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company provide any benefit or consideration to the holder of any such option or Company Restricted Shares in obtaining such amendment or take any other action prohibited in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Rule 14d-10 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.18 _Rule 16b-3_. 

  

 Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall each take all such reasonable steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Articles II_ and _III_ and any other dispositions of Equity Securities of the Company (including Company Options and Company Restricted Shares) by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company or at the Effective Time will become a director or executive officer of Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.19 _Senior Notes Change of Control Offer_. 

  

 The Company or an Affiliate of Parent shall mail, or cause to be mailed, notice to each holder of the Companys 10 1/4% Senior Notes due 2014 (the " _Notes_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Indenture dated as of July 31, 2007 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the " _Indenture_ ") describing the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and that the
consummation of the Offer constitutes a "Change of Control" under the
Indenture. Pursuant to the notice, the Company shall offer to repurchase the
Notes in accordance with the terms of Section 4.12(g) the Indenture at a
price of 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus

of the rules and interpretations of the SEC) after the expiration. For any

receive and the Company shall issue and exchange therefore, equity in an
amount equal to the Offer Price.

any material respect by such partys breach of any provision of this Agreement

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Date, if:

 The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of their respective officers, directors, representatives or agents, whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, subject to the payment of fees to the extent required by _Section 8.3_ of this Agreement, this Agreement (but not the Confidentiality Agreement) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any equityholder or Representative of such party) to the other party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of a party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other parties, (ii) failure of a party to perform a material covenant hereof, or (iii) breach by a party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, subject to _Section 9.11_, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such willful failure or breach; provided further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination hereof. 

  

 8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. 

   

 (b) In the event that: 

    

 (i) (A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company, the Board, or senior management of the Company, or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have publicly announced a bona fide intention (not subsequently withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal and (B) following the occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _8.1(d)(ii)_ and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal, within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated (provided that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ , the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ ; or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_. 

 

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this _Section
8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated
in writing by Parent (" _Payee_ ") a termination fee of $5,500,000 in cash
(the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (c) _Payment of Termination Fee_. Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be made to Payee on the date an Acquisition Proposal is consummated; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of _Section 8.3(b)_  

    ##### 

  

    

shall be made to Payee concurrently with, and as a condition to the
effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement; and in each case such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account to be designated by Parent. 

   

 (d) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ are not a penalty, but rather are a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the prevailing Party and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. 

   

 (e) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement the Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination, provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall preclude Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person from bringing or maintaining any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or its Affiliates for any termination in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ arising out of any willful or intentional breach.

 9.11 _Specific Performance_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in the Federal Court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware). This right shall include the right of the Company to (i) cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary to cause the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement and (ii) to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the parties thereto in accordance with the terms thereof. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If, prior to the End Date, any party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the Delaware Court presiding over such Action. 

   

 (b) 

    

 (i) The Company hereby agrees that, except as provided in _Section 9.11(b)(ii)_ below, specific performance shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as provided in _Section 9.11(b)(ii)_ below, that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that any be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages). 

   

 (ii) If a Court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent and Merger Subsidiary pursuant to this _Section 9.11,_ the Company may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages. If such a Court has granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach (which Parent agrees shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money)) only if, within two (2) weeks 

   ##### 

  

    

following such award, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have not consummated
the Offer and the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal
action or proceeding still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such
time as Parent and Merger Subsidiary consummate the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 9.12 _Limitations on Warranties_. 

  

 (a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Companys Disclosure Letter and any agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company makes no other express or implied representation or warranty to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 _ANNEX A_  

   

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_   

  

 Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ "). 

  

 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and Regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, may terminate or amend the Offer, unless, immediately prior to the Expiration Date: 

   

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn that number of Shares, which, together with the number of Shares,
if any, then owned beneficially by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole,
constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then
outstanding Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); 

   

(b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, shall have expired or
been terminated; and 

   

(c) the Board of Directors of the Company has appointed the directors in
accordance with Section 2.3 of the Merger Agreement conditioned only upon the
consummation of the Offer. 

  

 2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and Regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including  _Section 2.1_, may terminate or amend the Offer if any of the following conditions exist: 

   

(a) any order, decree, injunction or ruling restraining or enjoining or
otherwise materially delaying or preventing the acceptance for payment of, or
the payment for, some or all of the Shares or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Offer shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority
or any statute, rule or Regulation shall have been enacted that prohibits or
makes illegal the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all
of the Shares; 

   

(b) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.3_,  _Section 4.4(a)_ or _Section 4.7_, without giving effect
to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications, shall not
be true and correct in all material respects at and as of immediately prior
to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than
such representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only
as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects only as 

   ##### 

  

    

of such time), except that the representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 4.3(a)_ shall be true and correct other than any de minimis
inaccuracies and (B) all of the remaining representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to materiality
or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications shall not be true and
correct at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as if
made at and as of such time (other than such representations and warranties
that by their terms address matters only as of another specified time, which
shall be true and correct only as of such time) except, with respect to this
clause (B), where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so
true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; 

   

(c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or obligations to be performed or complied with
by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date; 

   

(d) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
an executive officer of the Company dated as of the date on which the Offer
expires certifying that the conditions specified in the foregoing clauses (b)
and (c) do not exist; 

   

(e) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s),
event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred, other
than as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, which has or have had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

   

(f) prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board shall
have withdrawn, modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent and
Subsidiary, its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement;
or 

   

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this _Annex A_ are for the benefit of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, except that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental Authority may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Tender Condition which may not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company) may be waived by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in its discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and Regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
