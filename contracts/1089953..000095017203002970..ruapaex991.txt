          Section 2.5.   CONTRACT ASSUMPTION AND ASSIGNMENT.

          (a)  ASSIGNED CONTRACTS. SCHEDULE 2.5(a) to the Sellers' Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list of all Contracts relating to the Business. SCHEDULE
2.5(a) is organized according to type of Contract and thereafter by counterparty
and, with respect to any Contract that consists of a master agreement and
separate purchase orders, statements of work, invoices, supplements, appendices,
schedules or amendments, SCHEDULE 2.5(a) describes each such purchase order,
statement of work, invoice, supplement, appendix, schedule or amendment in
reasonable detail. SCHEDULE 2.5(a) specifies with respect to each Contract set
forth thereon, the name of such Contract, the date of such Contract and any
amendments thereto, the parties to such Contract, and the correct address for
notices to counterparties thereunder. The Sellers shall assign and the Purchaser
shall assume those Contracts set forth on SCHEDULE 2.5(a) that are identified by
written notice from the Purchaser no later than twenty (20) Business Days after
the date hereof as Contracts which the Purchaser desires to assume
(collectively, the "ASSIGNED CONTRACTS") (it being understood that there shall
be no adjustment to the Purchase Price as a result of any exclusion of
properties, assets, Contracts or rights specified in any such notice).

          (b)  ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. Prior to any Seller entering into or
acquiring any Contract after the date hereof as permitted under Section
8.9(b)(ii) that relates to the Purchased Assets from and after the Closing Date,
such Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser and afford the Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity, prior to executing or acquiring such Contract, to
comment on the terms thereof. Upon executing or acquiring such Contract, the
Seller shall promptly furnish the Purchaser a fully executed copy of such
Contract.

                                       18

          (c)  CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Parties hereby agrees (i) that it is
in the best interests of the Sellers and the Purchaser for the lists of, or any
other information regarding, the Assigned Contracts, specifically including the
type of information set forth in SCHEDULE 2.5(a) to the Sellers' Disclosure
Letter (such information, the "CONTRACT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"), to be kept
confidential and not to be revealed, disclosed or divulged to any other party
(specifically excluding (x) the agents, advisors and actual or potential
investors and lenders of such Party who need to know such information and who
are advised of the confidential nature of such information, (y) the
representatives of any official committee appointed in the Bankruptcy Cases who
enter into a customary confidentiality agreement and their respective advisors
and (z) the Bankruptcy Court (collectively, the "INTERESTED PARTIES")) prior to
the date (the "NOTICE DATE") on which the counterparties to the Assigned
Contracts are given notice of a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to have the
Sellers assign the Assigned Contracts to the Purchaser or its Designees, (ii)
not to disclose any Contract Confidential Information to any third party (other
than the Interested Parties) other than as is required to be given to parties to
any of the Assigned Contracts ("CONTRACT PARTIES"), (iii) that the Contract
Confidential Information shall be kept confidential from and shall not be
disclosed to any party (other than any Interested Party) entitled to receive
notice in the Bankruptcy Cases until after the Notice Date, and (iv)
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Purchaser may contact any of the
Contract Parties in order to negotiate with such Contract Parties the possible
assignment and, if applicable, assumption of any Assigned Contracts, PROVIDED
that the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify and
coordinate with Radio Unica prior to any such negotiation.

          Section 2.6.   CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS. The Purchaser shall be obligated
to pay any amounts for services rendered and goods provided on and after the
Closing Date under any Assigned Contract validly assigned to the Purchaser or
its Designees.

          Section 2.7.   NO EXPANSION OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. The assumption by
the Purchaser or any of its Designees of the Assumed Liabilities shall in no way
expand the rights or remedies of any third party against the Purchaser, Radio
Unica or the Sellers as compared to the rights and remedies which such third
party would have had against Radio Unica or the Sellers absent the Bankruptcy
Cases and had the Purchaser or any of its Designees not assumed such Assumed
Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the
assumption by the Purchaser or any of its Designees of the Assumed Liabilities
shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights other than with respect to
the Person that is the obligee of such Assumed Liability.

                                   ARTICLE III

Sellers, plus or minus any adjustments to be made pursuant to Sections 3.5 and
8.13 hereof, and less the Earnest Money Deposit and the Holdback Amount (as so
adjusted, the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE"), and the Purchaser (or its Designees)

          Section 3.2.   Escrow Deposit.

          (a)  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall deliver to the escrow agent designated in the Escrow Agreement (the
"ESCROW AGENT"), the sum of Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,500,000) to be held as an earnest money deposit (together with all interest
thereon, the "EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT") pursuant to an Escrow Agreement executed
contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT")
in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be applied as follows:

                    (i)    Upon the Closing, the Earnest Money Deposit shall be
     applied as a deposit towards the Purchase Price as provided in Section 3.3.

                    (ii)   In the event that this Agreement is terminated for
     any reason whatsoever (other than pursuant to Section 10.1(h) or Section
     10.1(j)) the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to the Purchaser.

                    (iii)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated for
     the reasons set forth in Section 10.1(j), Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000)
     of the Earnest Money Deposit shall be paid to Radio Unica and the balance
     of the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to the Purchaser; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that if the FCC Consent has not been granted by March 31, 2004,
     then the portion of the Earnest Money Deposit payable to Radio Unica in the
     event that this Agreement is terminated for the reasons set forth in
     Section 10.1(j) shall be Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
     ($4,500,000) and the remainder of the Earnest Money Deposit shall be
     returned to the Purchaser.

                    (iv)   In the event that this Agreement is terminated for
     the reason set forth in Section 10.1(h), the Earnest Money Deposit shall
     continue to be held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement pending
     resolution of any related claims for damages.

          (b)  The Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Earnest Money
Deposit and any interest or dividends earned thereon for all Tax purposes.

          (c)  The Earnest Money Deposit shall not be deemed to be liquidated
damages and, except as set forth in Section 10.5, shall not limit any of the
Parties' available rights and remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity
or otherwise.

          Section 3.3.   PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. At the Closing, (a) the
Purchaser shall transfer or cause its Designee to transfer the Adjusted Purchase
Price to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an
account designated in writing by the Sellers, in accordance with the Bankruptcy
Plan, (b) the Earnest Money Deposit shall be paid to the Sellers pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, and (c) the Holdback Amount shall be paid by the Purchaser or
its Designee into escrow in accordance with the Holdback Escrow Agreement.

          Section 3.4.   ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchaser shall
allocate the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (and other relevant
items, including those pursuant to Section 3.5 and Article XI), as of the
Closing, among the classes of assets (as described in the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 338 of the Code) to which the Purchased

                                       20
<Page>

Assets relate (the "ALLOCATION") in accordance with section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (or any similar provision of local or
state Tax law) and shall submit the proposed Allocation to Radio Unica not later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing. If there is any adjustment to the
Purchase Price or the Assumed Liabilities (or other relevant items), the
Purchaser shall modify the Allocation by allocating such adjustment among the
Purchased Assets in accordance with section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (or any similar provision of local or state Tax law) and
shall submit the new proposed Allocation to Radio Unica within sixty (60) days
of such adjustment. If, within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the
proposed Allocation, Radio Unica notifies the Purchaser in writing that Radio
Unica has concluded that the proposed Allocation is not in accordance with
section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (or any
similar provision of local or state Tax law), then Radio Unica and the Purchaser
shall attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20)
days following Radio Unica's notification to the Purchaser of such disagreement.
If Radio Unica does not so notify the Purchaser within twenty (20) days of
receipt of the proposed Allocation, or upon resolution of the dispute by Radio
Unica and the Purchaser, the proposed Allocation shall become the final
Allocation. If Radio Unica and the Purchaser are unable to resolve their
disagreement within the twenty (20) days following any such notification by
Radio Unica, the dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm chosen jointly by the Purchaser and Radio Unica, for
resolution within twenty (20) days of such submission. All Parties shall
cooperate fully to facilitate a prompt determination of the Allocation. For all
Tax purposes, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reported
in a manner consistent with the final Allocation and neither Radio Unica, the
Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return (including IRS Form 8594), in any
litigation or otherwise, unless required by applicable Law. The fees, costs and
expenses of the accounting firm retained to resolve any dispute with respect to
the Allocation, if applicable, shall be borne equally by the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Radio Unica, on the other.

          Section 3.5.   PRORATION OF INCOME AND EXPENSES; ALLOCATION OF SALES
                         TAX.

          (a)  The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all of the items customarily prorated relating to
the ownership, lease, maintenance and operation of the Purchased Assets,
including those listed below (but not including income Taxes), shall be prorated
as of the Closing Date, with the Sellers liable to the extent such items relate
to any period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and
the Purchaser liable to the extent such items relate to any period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date (measured by calendar days):

                    (i)    personal property, real estate, occupancy and similar
     Taxes, but not income, profits or similar Taxes, on or arising out of, in
     respect of, or in connection with, the ownership, lease, maintenance or
     operation of the Purchased Assets;

                    (ii)   any permit, license, registration, compliance
     assurance fees or other fees arising out of, in respect of, or in
     connection with, any FCC Licenses or other Acquired Station Licenses;

                                       21
<Page>

                    (iii)  payments under the Studio Leases, Tower Site Leases
     or any other Lease constituting an Assigned Contract;

                    (iv)   payments under the Time Brokerage Agreements that
     constitute Assigned Contracts;

                    (v)    sewer rents and charges for water, telephone,
     electricity and other utilities arising out of, in respect of, or in
     connection with, the Purchased Assets;

                    (vi)   prepaid operating and maintenance expenses; and

                    (vii)  all other items normally adjusted in connection with
     similar transactions.

          (b)  Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, the net amount of all
such prorations and adjustments provided for in subsection (a) above shall be
settled and paid on the Closing Date by appropriate adjustment to the Purchase
Price. As to those prorations and adjustments not readily ascertained on the
Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Sellers will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve (using reasonable estimates where necessary) and
pay all adjustments and prorations hereunder within ninety (90) days of the
Closing Date. In the event of any disputes between the Parties as to such
adjustments, the amounts not in dispute shall nonetheless be paid at such time
and such disputes shall be resolved by an independent certified public
accountant mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and Radio Unica, and the fees
and expenses of such accountant shall be paid one-half by the Purchaser and
one-half by Radio Unica. The decision of such accountant shall be rendered
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date and shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parties.

                                   ARTICLE IV

     rights appurtenant to each of the Owned Real Properties as are necessary to

     way, and the improvements on the Owned Real Property have access to such
     sewer, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utilities as may be

     Letter, there are no lessees or tenants at will in possession of any
     portion of any of the Owned Real Property other than the applicable Seller,
     whether as lessee, tenants at will, trespassers or otherwise. The current

     restrictive covenants of record affecting any of the Owned Real Property.

     to the Owned Real Property have been obtained, have been validly issued and
     are in full force and effect. The Sellers have received no notice from any
     Governmental Entity of any violation of any zoning, building, fire, water,

     authorization issued in respect of any of the Owned Real Property that has
     not been heretofore corrected.

     Property (collectively, the "LEASES") are as set forth on SCHEDULE 2.1(c)
     of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter. True and correct copies of the Leases
     have been made available to the Purchaser. The information with respect to

     have accrued have been performed, and no landlord or lessor is in default
     under or in arrears in the payment of any sum or in the performance of any
     obligation required of it under any Lease, and no circumstance presently
     exists which, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would give rise
     to a default by the landlord or lessor under any Lease except, in all cases
     as such as will not materially detract from the marketability or value of
     the Leased Real Property and do not impair the operations of the lessee
     thereof in any material respect;

          (C)  all obligations of the tenant or lessee under the Leases that
     have accrued have been performed, and no Seller is in default under or in
     arrears in the payment of any sum or in the performance of any obligation
     required of it under any Lease, and no circumstance presently exists which,

     impair the operations of the lessee thereof in any material respect; and

          (D)  there are no consents of any landlord or lessor required to
     transfer the Leased Real Property to the Purchaser.

     from any insurance company of any material defects or inadequacies in the

Disclosure Letter contains a description of the items of Tangible Personal
Property (having a replacement cost of not less than $10,000 for each item) that
comprise all the tangible personal property used or held for use in connection
with the Business or which permit the operation of each Acquired Station as now
conducted. The Sellers have good title to, or a valid leasehold or license
interest in, all Tangible Personal Property, and none of such property is

Radio Unica or the Purchased Assets. SCHEDULE 2.1(a) of the Sellers' Disclosure
Letter sets forth an accurate list of all Acquired Station Licenses. The Sellers

except where the

                                       29

failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Radio Unica or on the Purchased Assets.

extent as the Business is currently conducted and there are no conditions upon
the FCC Licenses except those conditions stated on the face thereof or those
conditions that apply to radio broadcast licenses generally. No proceedings are

broadcasting industry generally) nor do any facts exist which may result in the
revocation, modification, non-renewal or suspension of any of the FCC Licenses,
the denial of any pending applications related to the FCC Licenses, the issuance
of any cease and desist order related to the FCC Licenses, the imposition of any
administrative actions by the FCC with respect to the FCC Licenses or which may
affect the Purchaser's ability to operate the Acquired Stations in accordance
with the FCC Licenses and the existing rules, regulations and policies of the
FCC (the "FCC RULES").

          (b)  Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.8(b)(i) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter, each Acquired Station and its transmission facilities are
operating in material compliance with the FCC Licenses and the FCC Rules. Each
Licensee has filed with the FCC all material reports or applications (including
payment of any fee, fine or forfeiture due to the FCC as of the date hereof)
with respect to the FCC Licenses and the relevant Acquired Station. Each Seller
has complied in all material respects with applicable FCC Rules pertaining to
(i) the relevant Acquired Station's public file, and (ii) the requirements to

a legal, valid and binding agreement of the applicable Seller party thereto and,
to the Knowledge of Radio Unica, of each other party thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium (whether general or specific), fraudulent conveyance and
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and is in full force and effect in each
case with such exceptions that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Radio Unica or
the Purchased Assets. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.9(b) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter, neither the Seller party to such Assigned Contract nor, to
the Knowledge of Radio Unica, no other party to any Assigned Contract is in
default or breach of such Assigned Contract, except for any default or breach
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Radio Unica or the Purchased Assets.

TAX RETURNS") have been filed, and the information provided on the Sellers Tax
Returns is true, correct and complete in all material respects, and all Taxes
shown to be due on the Sellers Tax Returns have been paid in full, except to the
extent that a failure to file the Sellers Tax Returns, an inaccuracy in the
Sellers Tax Returns, or a failure to pay such Taxes would not reasonably be
expected to result in the Purchaser being liable for such Taxes and would not
reasonably be expected to give rise to a Lien on the Purchased Assets.

          (b)  Subject to the entry of the Confirmation Order, all material
Taxes due and owing with respect to the Purchased Assets that are not required
to be shown on a Tax Return have been paid in full except to the extent that a
failure to pay such Taxes would not reasonably be expected to result in the
Purchaser being liable for such Taxes and would not reasonably be expected to
give rise to a Lien on the Purchased Assets.

          Section 5.11.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a)  There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Radio Unica,
threatened IP Claim against any Seller (i) alleging Infringement of material
Acquired Intellectual Property rights of any Person or (ii) challenging any
Seller's ownership or use of, or the validity, enforceability or registrability
of, any material Acquired Intellectual Property, and, to the Knowledge of Radio
Unica, there is no reasonable basis for an IP Claim regarding any of the
foregoing.

          (b)  None of the Sellers has brought or threatened an IP Claim against
any Person (i) alleging Infringement of material Acquired Intellectual Property
rights or (ii) challenging any Person's ownership or use of, or the validity,

Property based upon the material Acquired Intellectual Property, and, to the
Knowledge of Radio Unica, there is no reasonable basis for an IP Claim regarding
any of the foregoing.

          (c)  The Sellers have full legal and equitable title to the Acquired
Intellectual Property, and the Sellers have not transferred to any third party,
by assignment, mortgage, security interest, license, or otherwise, any legal or
equitable right, title or interest in and to the Acquired Intellectual Property
or any portion thereof. The Acquired Intellectual Property includes all
Intellectual Property licenses and other rights that are necessary for the use
of any Software and technical and engineering data and information comprising
any part of the Purchased Assets.

          (d)  The Patents, registered Trademarks, and registered Copyrights set
forth on SCHEDULE 5.11 of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter constitute a complete
listing of all foreign or domestic Patents, registered Trademarks, and
registered Copyrights which are used, held for use, or useable by any of the
Sellers in the conduct of the Business.

          Section 5.12.  LABOR MATTERS; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

          (a)  No Seller is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining
agreement or other labor contract applicable to any employees of the Business,
nor has any Seller agreed to recognize any labor union or other collective
bargaining representative, nor has any union or other collective bargaining
representative been certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of any
employees of the Business. To the Knowledge of Radio Unica, there are no
organizational efforts currently being made or threatened by or on behalf of any
labor union or other collective bargaining representative with respect to

Unica, threatened labor strike, slowdown, lock out, stoppage or other dispute

          (b)  Radio Unica has made available to the Purchaser true and correct
copies of each plan or arrangement (including each "employee benefit plan" as

with Radio Unica or any Seller under Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
AFFILIATE") and which provides benefits to any current or former employee of any
Seller employed in connection with the Business (collectively, "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS"). Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.12(b) of the Sellers' Disclosure
Letter (which, with respect to employees, former employees and qualified
beneficiaries of Radio Unica of Chicago, Inc. and Radio Unica of Fresno, Inc.,
identifies those persons as such), no employee, former employee or qualified
beneficiary of Radio Unica, any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate is receiving

Unica of Chicago, Inc. and Radio Unica of Fresno, Inc., neither Radio Unica nor
any Seller maintains any "group health plan" (as defined by Section 5000(b) of
the Code).

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Radio Unica or the Purchased
Assets, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, (i) Radio Unica, each Seller
and each ERISA Affiliate, as

                                       32

applicable, has performed all obligations required to be performed by them under
each Employee Benefit Plan, and none of Radio Unica, any Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate is in default under, or in violation of the terms of, any Employee
Benefit Plan; (ii) each Employee Benefit Plan has been established and
maintained in accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, including the timely filing of all required
reports, documents and notices, where applicable, with the IRS and the
Department of Labor; and (iii) no Employee Benefit Plan is under audit or
investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation and, to the Knowledge of Radio Unica, no such audit or
investigation is pending or threatened and no reason exists that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such audit or investigation. Except
as may be required by COBRA, no Employee Benefit Plan is a group health plan
providing coverage to former employees following termination of employment.

Disclosure Letter, there are no conditions or circumstances arising from or
relating to the Purchased Assets, the activities or operations of the Sellers

any Designee, such Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, deliver
written notice to the Purchaser of the existence and non-transfer,
non-conveyance or non-assumption of such item and provide the Purchaser with all
the information about and with access to such item as the Purchaser may
reasonably request, and, if requested by the Purchaser, transfer, convey or
assign to the Purchaser or its Designee (as specified by the Purchaser) such

LIENS; RECEIVABLES.

          (a)  To the extent that, under applicable Law, any Assigned Contract
(or any Seller's rights thereunder) may not be assigned to the Purchaser or its
Designee or transferred without the consent of a third party and such consent
has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign or transfer such Assigned Contract if an attempted assignment or transfer
would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful, and the appropriate Seller
shall:

                    (i)     use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure
     such consent and an assignment or a novation of such Assigned Contract;

                    (ii)    if it is unable to procure such consent and
     assignment or novation of such Assigned Contract, use its commercially
     reasonable efforts to establish a reasonable arrangement designed to
     provide the benefits and burdens of such Assigned Contract to the Purchaser
     or its Designee, including by sublicense, sublease, subcontract, escrow or
     similar arrangement at no additional charge or obligation to the Purchaser
     or any of its Affiliates (including any Designee); and

                    (iii)   remit any rents, revenues, security deposits or any
     other dollar amounts, notices or documents received by any Seller in
     connection with such Assigned Contract to the Purchaser or its Designee
     within five (5) Business Days of its receipt thereof, PROVIDED that the
     Purchaser or such Designee to whom such Contract was to be assigned shall
     be responsible for all obligations arising under such Assigned Contract
     after the Closing Date.

          (b)  Radio Unica shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain releases
evidencing the discharge and release of any Liens encumbering the Purchased
Assets that secure indebtedness for borrowed money, or any other obligations of
the Sellers, duly executed by the holders thereof in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and Radio Unica.

          (c)  The Purchaser shall remit to Radio Unica any payments the

receipt thereof.

          (d)  At any time after the Closing Date, each of Radio Unica, each
Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any
other assurances or documents and take such other actions reasonably requested
by any other Party and necessary for Radio Unica, each Seller or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, to satisfy its obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits
contemplated hereby.

          (e)  For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 8.4
shall survive the Closing.

<Page>

          (a)  Radio Unica shall cause the Sellers and any other Affiliate of
Radio Unica to, and the Sellers shall, permit the Purchaser and its
representatives after the date of execution of this Agreement to have reasonable
access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the
properties, officers and employees of Radio Unica and the Sellers (and the
Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Sellers'
outside independent accountants to be available to the Purchaser on the same
basis), and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Purchaser any
financial and operating data, Tax information, books and records, contracts and
documents and other information that is available with respect to the Sellers
and the Purchased Assets as the Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably
request (including any work papers of the Sellers' accountants); PROVIDED, that
the foregoing shall not require the Sellers to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment would result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate the Sellers'
obligations with respect to confidentiality owed to third parties, but, to the
extent permitted by the terms thereof, the Sellers shall inform the Purchaser of
any materials and documents subject to such restrictions on disclosure and, to
the extent feasible, redact the restricted information to permit the disclosure
of such material and documents.

          (b)  Radio Unica shall provide the Purchaser with copies of any
filing, statement, document or other information or material Radio Unica or any
of its Subsidiaries files with, submits to, presents to, or otherwise makes
available to the Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the United States Trustee or
any official committee appointed in the Bankruptcy Cases on the same date such
filing, statement, document or other information or material is so made,
presented or submitted.

          (c)  Radio Unica shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Purchased Assets, which notice shall include
a detailed description of such Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 8.6.   CONFIDENTIALITY.

          (a)  All information provided or obtained pursuant to this Agreement
shall be held by the Purchaser in accordance with and subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 25, 2003 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"), between the Purchaser and Radio Unica, all of the terms of which
shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the termination hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Parties
shall be permitted to make disclosures of confidential information thereunder to
any Interested Party. In addition, the Parties agree that the terms and
conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and information provided to
Purchaser in connection with the execution hereof shall be subject to the same
standard of confidentiality as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and understand that in
connection with seeking the approval of the Bankruptcy Plan, this Agreement
(together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto including the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter and Purchaser's Disclosure Letter) will be filed with the
Bankruptcy Court and made publicly available, and, prior to the entry of a
Confirmation Order, disclosures relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will be made to each official committee appointed in connection
with the Bankruptcy Cases and to its advisors and representatives, and the
Parties agree that such filing and disclosure will be not be deemed to violate
any confidentiality obligations owing to any

                                       43
<Page>

Party, whether pursuant to this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or
otherwise. This Section 8.6 shall not in any way limit the disclosure of
information by Radio Unica or the Sellers in connection with the administration
of the Bankruptcy Cases.

          (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement (including the
Confidentiality Agreement), the Parties and their Affiliates (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of the Parties and their Affiliates) may disclose
to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and
any facts that may be relevant to the Tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSACTION") beginning on the earlier of
(i) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the
Transaction, (ii) the date of public announcement of the Transaction, or (iii)
the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this Section
8.6(b) shall permit the Parties or their Affiliates (or any employee,
representative or other agent thereof) to disclose (y) any information that is
not necessary to understanding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transaction (including the identity of the Parties or their Affiliates or any
information that could lead another to determine the identity of the Parties or
their Affiliates) or (z) any information to the extent that such disclosure
could result in a violation of any federal or state securities Law.

          Section 8.7.   APPROPRIATE ACTIONS; REGISTRATIONS, FILINGS AND
CONSENTS.

          (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, after the
date hereof each of the Parties (i) shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as practicable; (ii) furnish the other Parties with copies of all documents
(except documents or portions thereof for which confidential treatment has been
requested or for which confidential treatment is provided by operation of Law)
and correspondence (A) prepared by or on behalf of it for submission to any
Governmental Entity and (B) received by or on behalf of it or its counsel from
any Governmental Entity, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with and keep the other Parties informed as to the status of
such matters. Radio Unica, the Sellers and the Purchaser will cooperate and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations required by
Section 9.1 hereof; provided the Purchaser shall be entitled to direct any
proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters
described in Section 8.7(c), provided that it shall afford Radio Unica and the
Sellers a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.

          (b)  The Purchaser will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
commitment for financing set forth in the Existing Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms thereof and, upon any occurrence of a Trigger Date, to
obtain and maintain a commitment (inclusive of the Existing Commitment Letter, a
"COMMITMENT LETTER") for debt financing of not less than $190 million on terms
that in all material respects are no less favorable to the Purchaser (and the
affiliated buyers contemplated thereby) than the terms of the Existing
Commitment Letter ("FINANCING").

                                       44
<Page>

          (c)  The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to
file as soon as practicable after the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the
Break-Up Payment Order (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
date thereof) all notifications, filings and other documents required under the
HSR Act, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests
received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity,
including for additional information or documentation. The Purchaser agrees to
take promptly all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust or competition law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to enable the Parties to expeditiously
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, that, except as
provided in Section 8.8(c), the Purchaser shall not be obligated to (i)
prosecute or defend any litigation against any Governmental Entity, (ii) divest
any assets or discontinue or modify any of its operations, or (iii) accept or
become subject to any condition or requirement in order to obtain approval of,
or avoid or eliminate an impediment to, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than in the cases of clauses (ii) and
(iii) for such divestitures, discontinuances, modifications, conditions or
requirements as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the assets, business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Parties
agree that the filing fee required to be paid in connection with the filing
under the HSR Act shall be borne equally by Radio Unica and the Purchaser.

          Section 8.8.   FCC CONSENT AND APPLICATION.

          (a)  FCC CONSENT. The transactions contemplated hereby are expressly
conditioned on and subject to the prior consent and approval of the FCC to
assignment of the FCC Licenses from the Sellers to the Purchaser or its Designee
("FCC CONSENT") and the FCC Consent becoming a Final Order.

          (b)  FCC APPLICATION. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to prepare and execute its respective portion of an application for FCC Consent
("FCC APPLICATION") to assignment of the FCC Licenses from the appropriate
Seller to the Purchaser and/or its Designee within five (5) Business Days, and
in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, after execution of this
Agreement, and each Seller shall promptly thereafter file the completed FCC
Application with the FCC with respect to its Acquired Station. The Parties shall
thereafter prosecute the FCC Application with all reasonable diligence and
otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the grant of the FCC
Application as expeditiously as practicable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, subject to
Section 8.8(c), the Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion to
make all decisions concerning any divestiture commitments necessary to comply
with the FCC's multiple ownership rules set forth at 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3555
as in effect on the Closing Date (the "FCC MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP RULES"); PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that the Purchaser shall regularly consult with Radio Unica during the
processes referred to in this Section 8.8 and consider in good faith the views
of Radio Unica with respect thereto; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not
seek a waiver of Section 73.3555 of the FCC Rules, except for a temporary waiver
thereof for a period not to exceed six (6) months from the Closing Date for
divestitures required in order to obtain the FCC Consent; PROVIDED that the
foregoing sentence shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) below.
Failure to obtain any of the waivers set forth above shall not limit the
Purchaser's obligations pursuant to subsection (c) below.

                                       45
<Page>

          (c)  The Purchaser, Radio Unica and the Sellers each agree to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents or waivers under FCC Rules or any
communications or broadcast Law that may be validly required by the FCC, so as
to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as expeditiously as reasonably possible, including committing to or effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or
disposition of such of its assets or businesses as are required to be divested
in order to obtain the FCC Consent, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order that would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, neither the Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to divest any of its material assets or
accept any material limitation on any of its businesses other than (i) the
divestiture of one radio station serving the Los Angeles market and one radio
station serving the New York market, in either case selected by the Purchaser in
its sole discretion or (ii) limitations on its operation of its broadcast assets
in the Los Angeles and New York markets, and then in any case only to the extent
required to comply with the FCC Multiple Ownership Rules.

          (d)  If a Trigger Date occurs, the Purchaser shall have the right to
notify the FCC of such fact and take such action as may be required by
applicable Law as a result of such notice being provided to the FCC.

          Section 8.9.   CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Except (A) as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, the Related Documents or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein, (B) as set forth in SCHEDULE 8.9 of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter or (C) with the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except with
respect to matters covered by Section 8.9(b)(i) which consent may be withheld in
the Purchaser's sole discretion), the Sellers agree that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date:

          (a)  the Sellers shall and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to
operate and maintain the Purchased Assets in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice; and

          (b)  the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Subsidiaries to:

                    (i)     sell, lease, transfer, grant a participation or
     security interest in, mortgage, pledge, assign, or otherwise encumber or
     subject to a Lien any of the Purchased Assets, except for (A) sales or
     other dispositions of Purchased Assets that are replaced at the Seller's
     sole cost and expense with like assets of comparable utility and value
     prior to the Closing and (B) sales or other dispositions of Purchased
     Assets, in the aggregate, having a value not in excess of $50,000;

                    (ii)    enter into any Contract related to the Business or
     any of the Purchased Assets involving more than $25,000 individually or any

                                       46
<Page>

                    (iii)   cancel, terminate, amend or modify in any material
     respect any existing Contract relating to the Business or any Assigned
     Contract or exercise any material right with respect thereto (including the
     exercise of any renewal option, right of first refusal or similar
     preemption right);

                    (iv)    fail to preserve Purchased Assets or deploy
     maintenance capital in the ordinary course;

                    (v)     grant, promise or otherwise agree to extend to any
     customer or prospective customer of the Business any credit for products or
     services to be provided after the date of this Agreement except as required
     under a binding Contract existing on the date hereof, except for credits
     granted in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and limited to
     services provided in the calendar quarter in which such credit was granted;

                    (vi)    take any action that jeopardizes the validity or
     enforceability of or rights under any of the Acquired Station Licenses;

                    (vii)   allow any insurance policy with respect to any of
     the Purchased Assets to be amended or terminated without replacing such
     policy with a policy providing substantially equivalent coverage insuring
     comparable risks and issued by an insurance company financially comparable
     to the prior insurance company; or

                    (viii)  fail to operate the Business in material compliance
     with applicable Laws including EHS Laws; or

                    (ix)    commit to any of the foregoing.

          Section 8.10.  ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT. The Purchaser may, at its own
expense, retain a qualified contractor to perform a Phase I environmental audit
and, if recommended by such contractor, a Phase II environmental audit with
respect to any Real Property, such audits to be completed within thirty (30)
days from the date of this Agreement. Each Seller shall provide such contractor
reasonably detailed information about and access to the relevant Real Property
for purposes of such audit(s).

                                       47
<Page>

          Section 8.11.  TITLE INSURANCE AND SURVEY.

          (a)  Each Seller shall permit the Purchaser to obtain before the
Closing Date a commitment for title insurance (a "TITLE COMMITMENT") from a
title insurance company selected by the Purchaser (the "TITLE COMPANY") to
issue, at the Purchaser's expense, an owner's title insurance policy insuring
the fee simple interest of such Seller in and to the Owned Real Property and a
lessee's title insurance policy insuring the leasehold interest of such Seller
in and to the Leased Real Property (each, a "TITLE POLICY"). The Title
Commitments shall be in the amount authorized by the Purchaser, shall set forth
the status of the title of the Real Property, and shall show all Liens and all
other matters of record affecting the Real Property. The Title Policies shall be
issued on the Closing Date.

          (b)  Each Seller shall permit the Purchaser to obtain at its own
expense before the Closing Date a survey (a "SURVEY") of each parcel of Real
Property which shall: (i) be prepared by a registered land surveyor selected by
the Purchaser; (ii) be certified to the Title Company, the Purchaser (or any
Designee) and the Purchaser's lenders; and (iii) show with respect to the Real
Property: (A) the legal description of the Real Property (which shall be the
same as the Title Policy pertaining thereto); (B) all buildings, structures and
improvements thereon and all restrictions of record and other restrictions that
have been established by an applicable zoning or building code or ordinance and
all easements or rights of way across or serving the Real Property (including
any off-site easements affecting or appurtenant thereto); (C) no material
encroachments upon the Real Property or adjoining parcels by buildings,
structures or improvements; (D) access to such parcel from a public street; and
(E) a flood certification reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser to the effect
that no portion of the Real Property is located within a flood hazard area.

          (c)  The Purchaser may at its election inform Radio Unica in writing
within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement with respect to which of
the Real Property it intends to obtain Title Commitments and Surveys. The
Purchaser's failure thereafter to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any such Title Commitments and Surveys, or any election by Purchaser not to
obtain any such Title Commitments and Surveys, shall not be a breach of this
Agreement, but the condition to Closing in Section 9.3(g) with respect to such
Title Commitments and Surveys shall be deemed waived.

          Section 8.12.  EMPLOYEES. The Purchaser may but shall not be required
to offer employment effective as of the Closing to individuals employed in
respect of the Business (collectively, "BUSINESS EMPLOYEES"), on such terms as
the Purchaser may determine in its sole discretion; PROVIDED that the Purchaser
shall cause its hiring process to comply with applicable Laws pertaining to
labor and employment, including without limitation Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, ERISA, and comparable state and
local Laws. Radio Unica and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Purchaser's
reasonable requests for access to the Business Employees for purposes of making
any such employment offer and shall not otherwise interfere with the Purchaser's
efforts to hire Business Employees. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall
provide the Sellers with a list of such employees to whom offers of employment
have been made or will be made by the Purchaser. Upon each such employee's
acceptance of such offer, the Sellers shall take such steps as may be necessary
to terminate any

                                       48
<Page>

employment relationship with such employee effective not later than the Closing
Date. The Sellers waive any claims against the Purchaser and any employee who
accepts the Purchaser's offer arising under any confidentiality agreement or
non-competition agreement between such person and the Sellers. The provisions of
this Section 8.12 shall neither create any rights in any employee to continued
employment with the Purchaser or any Designee for any specified period of time,
nor create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee, or any
other person (including any heir, beneficiary, executor, administrator, or
representative of any employee or any other person claiming through any such
employee or other person), with respect to such employee's or other person's
employment or any term or condition thereof.

          Section 8.13.  ADJUSTMENTS. The Purchase Price shall be reduced, as of
the Closing Date, by (i) the aggregate value of any Purchased Assets sold or
otherwise transferred to any Person other than the Purchaser or any Designee
pursuant to Section 8.9(b)(i)(B), (ii) the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate loss of Purchased Assets as a result of damage or destruction by fire
or other casualty, net of any related insurance proceeds received or to be
received pursuant to this Agreement in respect thereof, exceeds $1 million, and
(iii) the aggregate loss in value with respect to the Purchased Assets as the
result of any breach as of the Closing Date by Radio Unica or the Sellers of
their representations and warranties contained in (A) the second sentence of
Section 5.4(a), (B) the third sentence of Section 5.4(b)(i), (C) the second
sentence of Section 5.5 and (D) the second and third sentences of Section
5.8(a). Radio Unica shall notify the Purchaser promptly in writing of any such
sale or sales, damage or destruction or breach. If any such sale, damage or
destruction or breach would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchased
Assets, the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement, if applicable, pursuant to
Section 10.1(i). For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustments to the Purchase
Price that are required pursuant to this Section 8.13 shall not be deemed to
cure any breaches of covenants or failures of representations and warranties to
be true and correct for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 9.3 have been satisfied.

          Section 8.14.  CURE COSTS. The Sellers shall be exclusively
responsible for the payment of all costs, expenses and obligations required to
cure any existing defaults under any of the Assigned Contracts (or any other
Contracts assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(d)), or otherwise to
permit the assumption of the Assigned Contracts (or any other Contracts assumed
by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(d)) and their assignment to the
Purchaser or its Designee pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

                                   TERMINATION

          Section 10.1.  TERMINATION. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

          (a)  by mutual written consent of Radio Unica and the Purchaser;

          (b)  by the Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur on or before the
one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, that such date
shall automatically be extended 180 days if, on the one-year anniversary, (i)
the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(e) and Section 9.3(k) have not been
satisfied or waived; (ii) the other conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are then capable of being satisfied or have
been waived (other than the condition set forth in Section 9.3(j), but only to
the extent that such failure to be satisfied is due to the lack of a Final Order
with respect to the FCC Consent); and (iii) the FCC Consent required by Section
9.2(e) and Section 9.3(k) is being pursued with diligence and has not been
denied; PROVIDED FURTHER, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to the Purchaser if the Purchaser
shall have failed to perform, or failed to cause any of its Subsidiaries to
perform, any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such failure
is then continuing;

          (c)  by Radio Unica, if the Closing does not occur on or before the
one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, that such date
shall automatically be extended 180 days if, on the one-year anniversary, (i)
the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(e) and Section 9.3(k) have not been
satisfied or waived; (ii) the other conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are then capable of being satisfied or have
been waived (other than the condition set forth in Section 9.3(j), but only to
the extent that such failure to be satisfied is due to the lack of a Final Order
with respect to the FCC Consent); and (iii) the FCC Consent required by Section
9.2(e) and Section 9.3(k) is being pursued with diligence and has not been
denied; PROVIDED FURTHER, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available to Radio Unica if Radio Unica or any
Seller shall have failed to perform any of its respective material obligations
under this Agreement and such failure is then continuing;

          (d)  by either Radio Unica, on the one hand, or the Purchaser on the
other hand, if consummation of the transactions contemplated by Article II would
violate any Final Order of any Governmental Entity having competent
jurisdiction;

          (e)  by the Purchaser, if (i) the Board of Directors withdraws or
changes its recommendation of this Agreement in a manner materially adverse to
the Purchaser, (ii) the Board of Directors recommends an Alternative
Transaction, (iii) Radio Unica or any of the Sellers enters into an Alternative
Agreement, (iv) the Bankruptcy Case is converted to a case

                                       52
<Page>

under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or is dismissed or (v) a trustee is
appointed for any of the Sellers and such trustee rejects the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement;

          (f)  by Radio Unica, if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that entering into an Alternative Agreement with regard to a Superior Proposal
is necessary or advisable to satisfy the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors under applicable Law; PROVIDED that Radio Unica shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this subparagraph (f) only if it has
complied with the provisions of Section 8.2 hereof, and complies with the
requirements of Section 10.4 hereof relating to the payment (including the
timing of any payment) of the Break-Up Payment or Allowed Break-Up Payment
Claim, as the case may be, prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(f);

          (g)  by the Purchaser, if Radio Unica gives written notice to the
Purchaser that it is unable to obtain the consents required by Section 9.3(f);

          (h)  by Radio Unica, if there shall have been a breach of any covenant
or agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser shall have been or become untrue, in
each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a) or (b) would not
be satisfied, and any such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days of
the date of written notice of such breach from Radio Unica, so long as Radio
Unica or any Seller is not then in breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

          (i)  by the Purchaser, if there shall have been a breach of any
covenant or agreement on the part of Radio Unica or the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Radio Unica or the
Sellers shall have been or become untrue, in each case such that the conditions
set forth in Section 9.3(a) or (b) would not be satisfied, and any such breach
has not been cured within thirty (30) days, or five (5) days if the breach is in
respect of the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 8.1, of the date of
written notice of such breach from the Purchaser, so long as the Purchaser is
not then in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement;

          (j)  by Radio Unica if (A) at any time after the date hereof the
Purchaser ceases to have in effect a Commitment Letter with respect to the
Financing (the "TRIGGER DATE"), (B) the Purchaser fails to obtain a replacement
Commitment Letter with respect to the Financing (a "FAILURE") by the later of
(x) the 90th day after such Trigger Date or (y) the date on which all other
conditions to the Closing are capable of being satisfied or have been waived and
(C) Radio Unica gives the Purchaser written notice of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(j) after such Failure occurs (but
termination under this Section 10.1(j) shall not be permitted with respect to
such Failure if, prior to the time Radio Unica provides written notice of
termination as aforesaid, the Purchaser had obtained a replacement Commitment
Letter with respect to the Financing); and

          (k)  by the Purchaser, if the Break-Up Payment Order is not entered by
the Bankruptcy Court within thirty (30) days following the commencement of the
Bankruptcy Case.

                                       53

          Section 10.2.  NOTICE OF TERMINATION. In the event of any termination
pursuant to this Article X, written notice thereof setting forth the reasons
therefor shall promptly be given to the other Parties and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by
any Party.

          Section 10.3.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If validly terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become wholly void and of no further force
and effect without any liability whatsoever to Radio Unica, the Sellers and the
Purchaser or any of its or their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives, except that the
obligations of the Purchaser under the Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of the Parties under the Escrow Agreement, this Section 10.3 and
Sections 3.2, 8.6, 10.4, 10.5 and Article XII of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect.

          Section 10.4.  BREAK-UP PAYMENT.

          (a)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Radio Unica
pursuant to Section 10.1(f) or by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1(e), the
Sellers agree to pay to the Purchaser the Break-Up Payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
any such Break-Up Payment shall not be due and payable if (i) a Material Adverse
Effect on the Purchaser shall have occurred (other than as a direct result of a
material breach by Radio Unica or any of the Sellers of any provision of this
Agreement), or (ii) the Purchaser shall have breached any of its obligations,
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement in any material
respect and such breach has not been cured. The Purchaser shall have immediately
earned any such Break-Up Payment as of (i) the date Radio Unica terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f) or (ii) the earliest date the Purchaser
could have terminated this Agreement under Section 10.1(e). Upon payment of the
Break-Up Payment as provided in Section 10.4(b) and the return of the Escrow
Deposit to the Purchaser, Radio Unica, each Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall be fully released and discharged from any liability under or
resulting from this Agreement and the Purchaser shall not have any other remedy
or cause of action under or relating to this Agreement or any applicable Law
including for reimbursement of expenses. The release and discharge from
liability referred to in the preceding sentence shall be self-executing, and
shall be effective immediately upon payment of the Break-Up Payment and the
return of the Escrow Deposit.

          (b)  Any Break-Up Payment payable to the Purchaser pursuant to Section
10.4(a) shall be paid:

                    (i)     on or before the fifth Business Day after the
     Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(e) unless the
     Bankruptcy Court orders otherwise in the Break-Up Payment Order itself or
     the Break-Up Payment Claim Order itself, as applicable; or

                    (ii)    contemporaneously with and as a condition to the
     effectiveness of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
     10.1(f).

          (c)  Radio Unica and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) the
payment of the Break-Up Payment or, if applicable, the allowance of the Allowed
Break-Up Payment Claim and

                                       54
<Page>

the Restructuring Companies' agreement to request Administration Claim status
therefore is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) in the absence of the Restructuring Companies' obligations to
make this payment and agreement to request such status, the Purchaser would not
have entered into this Agreement, (iii) the entry of the Purchaser into this
Agreement is necessary for preservation of the estate(s) of the Restructuring
Companies and beneficial to the Restructuring Companies, (iv) the Break-Up
Payment is reasonable in relation to the Purchaser's efforts and to the
magnitude of the transaction and (v) time is of the essence with respect to
entry of the Break-Up Payment Order.

          Section 10.5.  REMEDIES UPON TERMINATION.

          (a)  In the event Radio Unica terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(h), then Radio Unica and the Sellers shall be entitled to seek all
rights and remedies available to them at law or in equity; PROVIDED, that the
aggregate money damages payable to Radio Unica and the Sellers in such event
shall not exceed Thirty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($37,500,000).

          (b)  In the event the Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(e), or Radio Unica terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(f), then, as the Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy, the Purchaser shall
receive an amount equal to the Break-Up Payment as liquidated damages in
accordance with Section 10.4.

          (c)  In the event the Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(i), then the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek all rights and
remedies available to it at law or in equity; PROVIDED, that the aggregate money
damages payable to the Purchaser in such event shall not exceed Thirty-Seven
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000) less the amount of a
Break-Up Payment, if any, received by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.4.

          (d)  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event payment is made under
Section 3.2(a)(iii), the provisions of Section 10.5(a) shall not be applicable.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                          SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 11.1.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement shall terminate and will have no further force and
effect after the Closing Date. No covenants or agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date, except those
covenants that contemplate or may involve actions to be taken or obligations in
effect after the Closing Date.

          Section 11.2.  POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent provided in
this Article XI, from and after the Closing Date, Radio Unica and each Seller,
jointly and severally, shall reimburse the Purchaser for the failure to deliver
to the Purchaser or its Designee good and marketable title to, and possession
of, the Tangible Personal Property identified in SCHEDULE 2.1(b) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter free and clear of all claims (as defined under the Bankruptcy
Code), interests and Liens other than Permitted Liens to the extent such
Permitted

                                       55
<Page>

Liens cannot be removed by operation of sections 105, 363(f) or 1141 of the
Bankruptcy Code; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Purchaser shall not be reimbursed
for any such failure that has been the subject of an adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 8.13 hereof (including any deductible contained
therein).

          Section 11.3.  INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES AND LIMITATIONS. Any
Indemnity Claim must be made by delivering written notice to Radio Unica,
specifying the Tangible Personal Property that is the subject of such Indemnity
Claim and the amount of reimbursement sought (which amount shall not be
determinative of the final amount of the Indemnity Claim), within thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date. The amount of any reimbursement pursuant to Section
11.2 shall not include any Taxes incurred by the Purchaser or its Affiliates as
a result of receiving a payment under this Article XI.

          Section 11.4.  HOLDBACK ESCROW. Any amounts due and owing to the
Purchaser pursuant to an Indemnity Claim shall be paid promptly out of the
Holdback Deposit in accordance with the Holdback Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the termination of the Holdback Escrow Agreement or the full
disbursement and/or release of the Holdback Deposit, Radio Unica and the Sellers
shall remain liable for any Indemnity Claim as provided in this Article XI.

          Section 11.5.  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The indemnification provisions of
this Article XI shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any
representation, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or other
provision of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than
for claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or any breach of a
covenant of Radio Unica or the Sellers that survives the Closing as provided in
Section 11.1. Under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          Section 12.1.  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Radio Unica, each of the Sellers and
the Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver
is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party or Parties in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

          Section 12.2.  EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, including Section 10.4, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Parties shall bear their own
respective expenses (including, but not limited to, all compensation and
expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent
accountants) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                                       56

          Section 12.3.  PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Each of the Parties agrees with the
other Parties that, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
applicable Law or the requests, rules and regulations of each stock exchange
upon which the securities of one of the Parties or its Affiliates is listed, no
press release or similar public announcement or communication will be made or
caused to be made concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement
unless specifically approved in advance by all Parties; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
to the extent that any Party to this Agreement is required by applicable Law or
the requests, rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the
securities of one of the Parties or its Affiliates is listed to make such a
public disclosure, such public disclosure shall only be made after prior
consultation with the other Parties.

          Section 12.4.  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The Parties recognize that if any
Party breaches this Agreement or refuses to perform under the provisions of this
Agreement, monetary damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the
non-breaching Party or Parties for their injuries. The non-breaching Party or
Parties shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may
be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If
any action is brought by the non-breaching Party or Parties to enforce this
Agreement, the Party in breach shall waive the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law. No provision of this Section 12.4 shall be deemed to nullify any
of the limitations on money damages set forth in Section 10.5.

          Section 12.5.  ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall not be assigned, delegated or
otherwise transferred by Radio Unica, any Seller or the Purchaser; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Purchaser may assign its rights to purchase the Purchased
Assets or assume any Assigned Contract to any Designee, and the Purchaser may
assign this Agreement, and its rights hereunder, to any of its lenders, but in
no event will such assignment relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder.

          Section 12.6.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including all
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the Sellers' Disclosure Letter and the
Purchasers' Disclosure Letter) contains the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect for
the term provided for therein.

          Section 12.7.  FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. Any obligation of any Party
to any other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed,
satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party or Designee, shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

          Section 12.8.  PARTIES IN INTEREST; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Radio
Unica, each Seller and the Purchaser, or their successors or permitted assigns,
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                       57

          Section 12.9.  SCHEDULES. The inclusion of any matter in any Schedule
to this Agreement shall be deemed to be an inclusion for all purposes of this
Agreement, to the extent that such disclosure is sufficient to identify the
section to which such disclosure is responsive, but inclusion therein shall not
be deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any particular fact or item in any Schedule,
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission as to whether the fact or
item is "material" or would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."

          Section 12.10. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and any amendments hereto
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
an original by the Parties executing such counterpart, but all of which shall be
considered one and the same instrument.

          Section 12.11. HEADINGS. The section and paragraph headings and table
of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

this Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the Parties, the Parties
confirm that both they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated
and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the
Parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction construing ambiguities against the draftsperson shall be
applied against any Person.

          Section 12.14. GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent the mandatory
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code apply, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state without regard to
principles of conflicts or choice of laws or any other law that would make the
laws of any other jurisdiction other than the State of New York applicable
hereto. The Parties agree that, except as provided herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, without limitation of any Party's right to appeal any order of the
Bankruptcy Court, upon the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (a) the
Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive

                                       59

jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or
disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement,
any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated herein; and
(b) any and all Claims relating to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained
only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent and submit to the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.

          Section 12.15. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability.

          Section 12.16. LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE. To facilitate the transfer of the
Purchased Assets as part of a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code,
the Purchaser may assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or part, to a
"qualified intermediary" (within the meaning of Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the
Treasury Regulations). In such case, the Purchaser will identify the qualified
intermediary to the Sellers in writing, and the Sellers shall convey the
Purchased Assets (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the
Purchaser or the qualified intermediary) as instructed by the qualified
intermediary at the Closing. The Sellers agree to take such actions, execute
such documents, and otherwise cooperate with the Purchaser and the qualified
intermediary as necessary or appropriate to consummate any such Section 1031
exchange; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Section 1031 exchange shall not relieve
the Purchaser of its duties and obligations under this Agreement.

                              ESCROW AGREEMENT

         THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of October 3, 2003, by and among Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a
national banking association, as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), Radio Unica
Communications Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Radio Unica"), and
Multicultural Radio Broadcasting Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Purchaser").
For purposes of this Agreement, Escrow Agent, Radio Unica and Purchaser are
hereinafter sometimes referred to individually as the "Party" and collectively
as the "Parties."


                             W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Radio Unica and Purchaser, together
with Radio Unica Corp., certain of its Subsidiary Licensees and certain of its
Subsidiary Operating Companies, are entering into that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement"), relating to
Radio Unica's sale and assignment, and Purchaser's purchase and assumption, of
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities (the "Transaction");

         WHEREAS, the Parties desire to execute this Agreement to specify and
clarify their rights and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money
Deposit;

         WHEREAS, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any
capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not specifically defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings given them in the Purchase Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the
mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:


                                  ARTICLE 1

                                REPRESENTATIONS

         Section 1.01. On the date hereof, Purchaser shall transfer to Escrow
Agent, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, from Purchaser's own
funds the Earnest Money Deposit which is a cash amount equal to Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000.00) (the "Escrow Funds"). The
Parties agree that the Escrow Funds are to be held in trust pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement by Escrow Agent until the Termination Date (as defined
in Section 7.07). Escrow Agent shall confirm in writing to the other Parties
the receipt by it of the Escrow Funds.

         Section 1.02. Radio Unica and Purchaser hereby appoint Escrow Agent
to receive, hold, invest and disburse the Escrow Funds pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to assume or
perform any obligation of Purchaser or Radio Unica under the Purchase
Agreement by reason of anything contained in this Agreement. Escrow Agent
hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

         Section 1.03. Each of the Parties has authority to enter into this
Agreement, and has taken all actions necessary to authorize the execution of
this Agreement by the officers whose signatures are affixed hereto.


                                   ARTICLE 2

                                    ESCROW

         Section 2.01. Escrow Agent shall establish a special escrow
designated as the "Earnest Money Deposit Escrow" (the "Escrow"), shall keep
such Escrow separate and apart from all other funds and moneys held by it, and
shall administer such Escrow as provided in this Agreement.

         Section 2.02. All Escrow Funds referred to in Section 1.01, along
with any income or interest earned thereon, shall be credited to the Escrow.
Until disbursed as set forth herein, all such income or interest shall
constitute additional Escrow Funds.

         Section 2.03.

         (a) Escrow Agent shall disburse Escrow Funds on deposit in the Escrow
to Purchaser, Radio Unica or both, as the case may be, upon receipt of :

                  (i) one or more fully executed Payment Request Forms in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, executed by an authorized
officer of each of Purchaser and Radio Unica, and otherwise pursuant to the
terms hereof. Upon receipt of a Payment Request Form, the amounts specified
therein shall be promptly paid directly to the Person or Persons entitled to
payment as specified in the Payment Request Form; or

                  (ii) a copy of a Final Determination (as defined below)
establishing a Party's right to the Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 3.2(a) of
the Purchase Agreement. A "Final Determination" shall mean a final
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and shall be
accompanied by an opinion of counsel for the presenting Party to the effect
that such judgment is a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

         (b) In the event of any disagreement between Radio Unica and
Purchaser resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with
the Escrow Funds, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Funds
until Escrow Agent shall have received a Final Determination (accompanied by
the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 2.03(a)(ii)) directing delivery
of the Escrow Funds or a written agreement executed by Radio Unica and
Purchaser directing delivery of the Escrow Funds, in which event Escrow Agent
shall disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with such Final Determination or
agreement.

         (c) Escrow Agent shall take all actions called for in any Payment
Request Form, Final Determination, or written agreement delivered under
Section 2.03(a) or (b) within five (5) Business Days of the date such Payment
Request Form, Final Determination, or written agreement, as the case may be,
is received.

         (d) Any Escrow Funds in the Escrow as of the Termination Date (as
defined below) shall be distributed to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days
after the Termination Date unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser
and Radio Unica.

         Section 2.04. In the event that the Escrow Funds are not sufficient
for full payment of any amount to which Radio Unica is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.03, Purchaser shall continue to be liable for the shortfall amount.

         Section 2.05. Escrow Agent is acting hereunder as a depository only
and Escrow Agent shall only be responsible for the safekeeping and investment
of Escrow Funds held in the Escrow, and the disbursement thereof in accordance
with this Agreement, and shall not be responsible for the authenticity or
accuracy of such certifications or documents, the application of amounts paid
pursuant to such certifications by the Persons to which they are paid, or the
sufficiency of Escrow Funds credited to the Escrow to make the payments herein
required. This Agreement expressly sets forth the duties and obligations of
Escrow Agent and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against Escrow Agent.


                                  ARTICLE 3

                         MONEYS IN ESCROW; INVESTMENT

         Section 3.01. Except to the extent that and until Radio Unica is or
becomes expressly entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow
Funds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (i) Purchaser and Radio Unica
intend, and hereby inform Escrow Agent, that the Escrow shall constitute an
escrow account in which Radio Unica and its creditors have no legal or
equitable right, title or interest of any kind whatsoever, and (ii) all of the
Escrow Funds and any earnings thereon shall be the sole property of Purchaser.
Prior to any distribution of the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall be treated as the owner thereof and any
interest or dividends earned thereon for all purposes (including Tax
purposes).

         Section 3.02. Escrow Funds held by Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
invested and reinvested by Escrow Agent in short term money market funds
investing in direct obligations of the United States of America or repurchase
agreements containing such obligations or, in direct obligations of the United
States of America having maturities of ninety-one (91) days or less, or
short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or
any agencies or instrumentalities thereof, in either case, as Escrow Agent is
directed by Purchaser in writing. Such investments shall be registered in the
name of Escrow Agent and held by Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow and,
together with earnings thereon, shall constitute further Escrow Funds
hereunder. Escrow Agent may make investments through its investment division
or short-term investment department. Escrow Agent shall sell and reduce to
cash a sufficient amount of investments of the Escrow Funds whenever the cash
balance therein is insufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid
therefrom. Escrow Agent shall, without further direction from any Person, sell
such investments as and when required to make any payments from the Escrow
required to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Unless Escrow Agent is guilty
of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct with regard to its duties
hereunder, Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any loss
suffered in connection with any investment of moneys made by Escrow Agent in
accordance with this Article 3.

         Section 3.03. Escrow Agent shall furnish to Radio Unica and Purchaser
reports accounting for all investments and interest and income therefrom. Such
accounting shall be furnished no less frequently than every month and upon
request of Radio Unica or Purchaser.


                                  ARTICLE 4

                   ESCROW AGENT'S AUTHORITY; INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 4.01. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any writing or
instrument or signature which it, in good faith, believes to be genuine, may
assume the validity and accuracy of any statement or assertion contained in
such a writing or instrument, and may assume that any Person purporting to
give any writing, notice, advice or instructions in connection with the
provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. Prior to or concurrent
with the delivery and execution of this Agreement each of Purchaser and Radio
Unica shall deliver an incumbency certificate to Escrow Agent designating the
person or persons of such Party from whom the Escrow may accept written
instructions. Each incumbency certificate shall contain a specimen signature
of each person so designated and each of Purchaser and Radio Unica may update
or revise its incumbency certificate from time to time. Escrow Agent shall not
be liable in any manner for the sufficiency or correctness as to form, manner
and execution, or validity of any instrument deposited with it, nor as to the
identity, authority or right of any Person executing the same; and its duties
hereunder shall be limited to those specifically provided herein.

         Section 4.02. Unless Escrow Agent is guilty of gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct with regard to its duties hereunder, Purchaser and
Radio Unica hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify Escrow Agent and
hold it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, actions, suits
or proceedings at law or in equity, or any other expense, fees or charges of
any character or nature, which it may incur or with which it may be threatened
by reason of its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement; and in
connection therewith, to indemnify Escrow Agent against any and all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and the cost of defending any action,
suit or proceeding or resisting any claim. Escrow Agent shall be vested with a
lien on all property deposited hereunder for indemnification, for reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, for any suit, interpleader or otherwise, or any
other expenses, fees or charges of any character or nature, which may be
incurred by Escrow Agent by reason of disputes arising between Purchaser and
Radio Unica as to the correct interpretation of the Purchase Agreement or this
Agreement and instructions given to Escrow Agent hereunder, or otherwise, with
the right of Escrow Agent, regardless of the instructions aforesaid, to hold
the said property until and unless said additional expenses, fees and charges
shall be fully paid. The foregoing indemnities in this Section 4.02 shall
survive the resignation or substitution of Escrow Agent or the Termination
Date.

         Section 4.03. If Purchaser and Radio Unica shall be in disagreement
about the interpretation of the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement, or about
the rights and obligations, or the propriety of any action contemplated by
Escrow Agent hereunder, Escrow Agent may, but shall not be required to, file
an appropriate civil action to resolve the disagreement. Escrow Agent shall be
indemnified, jointly and severally, by Purchaser and Radio Unica for all
costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in connection with such civil
action, and shall be fully protected in suspending all or part of its
activities under this Agreement until a final judgment, without any further
right of appeal, in such action is received.

         Section 4.04. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any mistakes of
facts or errors of judgment, or for any acts or omissions of any kind, unless
caused by its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

         Section 4.05. Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its own
choosing, at the joint expense of Purchaser and Radio Unica, as to any matter
relating to this Escrow Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall not incur any
liability in acting in good faith in accordance with any advice from such
counsel. Section 4.06. Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not
performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility
hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the control of Escrow Agent
(including but not limited to any act or provision of any present or future
law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or war, civil
unrest, local or national disturbance or disaster, any act of terrorism, or
the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or facsimile or other wire
or communication facility).

         Section 4.07. Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the
Escrow Funds held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its
own similar property and shall not be required to invest any funds held
hereunder except as directed in this Escrow Agreement. Uninvested funds held
hereunder shall not earn or accrue interest.

         Section 4.08. In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder
or in any notice, instruction or other communication received by Escrow Agent
hereunder, Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any
action other than to retain possession of the Escrow Funds, unless Escrow
Agent receives written instructions signed by each of Purchaser and Radio
Unica, which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.

         Section 4.09. In the event of any dispute between or conflicting
claims among the Purchaser and Radio Unica and any other Person with respect
to any Escrow Funds, Escrow Agent shall be entitled, in its sole discretion,
to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with
respect to such Escrow Funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall
continue, and Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way to
Purchaser or Radio Unica for failure or refusal to comply with such
conflicting claims, demands or instructions. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
refuse to act until, in its sole discretion, either (i) such conflicting or
adverse claims or demands shall have been determined by a final order,
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, which order, judgment
or decree is not subject to appeal, or settled by agreement between the
conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to Escrow Agent or
(ii) Escrow Agent shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to
it sufficient to hold it harmless from and against any and all losses which it
may incur by reason of so acting. Any court order, judgment or decree shall be
accompanied by a legal opinion by counsel for the presenting party,
satisfactory to Escrow Agent, to the effect that said order, judgment or
decree represents a final adjudication of the rights of the parties by a court
of competent jurisdiction, and that the time for appeal from such order,
judgment or decree has expired without an appeal having been filed with such
court. Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinions without
further question. Escrow Agent may, in addition, elect, in its sole
discretion, to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief
or orders as it may deem, in its sole discretion, necessary. The costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such proceeding shall be paid by, and shall be deemed a joint
and several obligation of, Purchaser and Radio Unica.

         Section 4.10. No printed or other material in any language, including
prospectuses, notices, reports, and promotional material, which mentions
"Bankers Trust Company", "Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas" or "Deutsche
Bank AG" or any of their respective affiliates by name or the rights, powers,
or duties of Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement, shall be issued by any
other Party, or on such Party's behalf, without the prior written consent of
Escrow Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not preclude the filing and
use of this Agreement or any document referring to this Agreement with or by
any court or governmental authority.


                                  ARTICLE 5

                          ESCROW AGENT'S COMPENSATION

         Section 5.01. As partial consideration of Radio Unica's entering into
this Agreement, Purchaser hereby agrees to be solely responsible for and pay
Escrow Agent its annual fee for the services to be rendered hereunder as
provided in Exhibit B hereto. Any fees due to Escrow Agent, including
investment fees or other investment-related charges, may be deducted by Escrow
Agent from the investment earnings on the Escrow if Escrow Agent provides
Purchaser and Radio Unica with a listing of such fees in reasonable detail.
Any investment fees or investment-related charges in excess of investment
earnings will be paid by Purchaser.


                                  ARTICLE 6

                            CHANGE OF ESCROW AGENT

         Section 6.01. A national banking association located in the United
States of America or a state bank or trust company organized under the laws of
a state of the United States of America, qualified as a depository of public
funds, may be substituted to act as Escrow Agent under this Agreement upon the
agreement of Purchaser and Radio Unica. Such substitution shall not be deemed
to affect the rights or obligations of the Parties. Upon any such
substitution, Escrow Agent agrees to assign to such substitute Escrow Agent
its rights and obligations under this Agreement.

         Section 6.02. Escrow Agent or any successor may at any time resign by
giving notice by registered or certified mail to Purchaser and Radio Unica of
its intention to resign and of the proposed date of resignation, which shall
be a date not less than thirty (30) days after such notice is deposited in the
United States mail with postage fully prepaid, unless an earlier resignation
date and the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent shall have been or are
approved by Purchaser and Radio Unica. If Purchaser and Radio Unica are unable
to agree upon a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after such
notice, Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief.

         Section 6.03. Any corporation into which Escrow Agent, or any
successor to it of the duties and responsibilities created by this Agreement,
may be merged or converted or with which it or any successor to it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion,
consolidation or reorganization to which Escrow Agent or any successor to it
may be a party or any entity to which Escrow Agent may sell or transfer all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business, shall be the successor
Escrow Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper
or any other act on the part of the Parties, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to Escrow Agent shall be effective only

Bankruptcy Code apply, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and to be performed entirely in such state without regard to principles
of conflicts or choice of laws or any other law that would make the laws of
any other jurisdiction other than the State of New York applicable hereto. The
Parties agree that, except as provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement,
without limitation of any Party's right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy
Court, upon the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (a) the Bankruptcy Court

to decide any claims or disputes which may arise or result from, or be
connected with, this Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the
transactions contemplated herein; and (b) any and all Claims relating to the
foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the
Parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.

         Section 7.04. Any provisions of this Agreement found to be prohibited
by law shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition, and shall
not invalidate the remainder of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement.

benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

         Section 7.06. This Agreement may be simultaneously executed in

         THIS HOLDBACK ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, Radio Unica and Purchaser, together with Radio Unica Corp.,
certain of its Subsidiary Licensees and certain of its Subsidiary Operating
Companies, have entered into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
October 3, 2003 (the "Purchase Agreement"), relating to Radio Unica's sale and
assignment, and Purchaser's purchase and assumption, of the Purchased Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities (the "Transaction");

         WHEREAS, this Agreement is being entered into simultaneously with the
Closing under the Purchase Agreement in order to specify and clarify the rights
and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to the Holdback Deposit; and

         WHEREAS, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any capitalized
terms used in this Agreement that are not specifically defined in this Agreement
shall have the meanings given them in the Purchase Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties, intending to
be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                 REPRESENTATIONS

         Section 1.01. On the date hereof,  Purchaser shall transfer to Escrow
Agent, by wire transfer in immediately  available funds,  from Purchaser's own
funds  the  Holdback  Deposit  which is a cash  amount  equal to Five  Hundred
Thousand Dollars  ($500,000.00)  (the "Escrow Funds").  The Parties agree that
the  Escrow  Funds  are to be held in  trust  pursuant  to the  terms  of this
Agreement  by Escrow Agent until the  Termination  Date (as defined in Section
7.07) unless earlier paid out as provided  herein.  Escrow Agent shall confirm
in writing to the other Parties the receipt by it of the Escrow Funds.

         Section 1.02.  Radio Unica and Purchaser  hereby appoint Escrow Agent
to  receive,  hold,  invest and  disburse  the Escrow  Funds  pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to assume or
perform  any  obligation  of  Purchaser  or Radio  Unica  under  the  Purchase
Agreement  by reason of anything  contained  in this  Agreement.  Escrow Agent
hereby  accepts  such  appointment  and  agrees  to be bound by the  terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

         Section  1.03.  Each of the Parties has  authority to enter into this
Agreement,  and has taken all actions  necessary to authorize the execution of

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                    ESCROW

         Section  2.01.   Escrow  Agent  shall   establish  a  special  escrow
designated as the "Holdback  Deposit Escrow" (the  "Escrow"),  shall keep such
Escrow  separate  and apart from all other  funds and  moneys  held by it, and
shall administer such Escrow as provided in this Agreement.

         Section 2.02.  All Escrow Funds  referred to in Section  1.01,  along
with any income or interest earned  thereon,  shall be credited to the Escrow.
Until  disbursed  as set  forth  herein,  all such  income or  interest  shall
constitute additional Escrow Funds.

         Section 2.03.

         (a) Escrow Agent shall disburse all Escrow Funds on deposit in the
         Escrow to Purchaser, Radio Unica or both, as the case may be, upon
         receipt of :

                  (i) one or more fully executed Payment Request Forms in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, executed by an authorized
officer of each of Purchaser and Radio Unica, and otherwise pursuant to the
terms hereof. Upon receipt of a Payment Request Form, the amounts specified
therein shall be promptly paid directly to the Person or Persons entitled to
payment as specified in the Payment Request Form; or

                  (ii) a copy of a Final Determination (as defined below)
establishing a Party's right to the Escrow Funds pursuant to Article XI of the
Purchase Agreement. A "Final Determination" shall mean a final non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and shall be accompanied by an
opinion of counsel for the presenting party to the effect that such judgment is
a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

         (b) In the event of any disagreement between Radio Unica and Purchaser
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Escrow
Funds, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Funds until Escrow
Agent shall have received a Final Determination (accompanied by the opinion of
counsel referred to in Section 2.03(a)(ii)) directing delivery of the Escrow
Funds or a written agreement executed by Radio Unica and Purchaser directing
delivery of the Escrow Funds, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse the
Escrow Funds in accordance with such Final Determination or agreement.

         (c) Escrow Agent shall take all actions called for in any Payment
Request Form, Final Determination, or written agreement delivered under Section
2.03(a) or (b) within five (5) Business Days of the date such Payment Request
Form, Final Determination or written agreement, as the case may be, is received.

         (d) Any Escrow Funds in the Escrow as of the Termination Date (as
defined below) shall be distributed to Radio Unica within ten (10) Business Days
after the Termination Date unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser
and Radio Unica.

         Section 2.04. In the event that the Escrow Funds are not sufficient
for full payment of any amount to which Purchaser is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.03, Radio Unica shall continue to be liable for the shortfall amount
to the extent provided in Article XI of the Purchase Agreement.

         Section 2.05. Escrow Agent is acting hereunder as a depository only
and Escrow Agent shall only be responsible for the safekeeping and investment
of Escrow Funds held in the Escrow, and the disbursement thereof in accordance
with this Agreement, and shall not be responsible for the authenticity or
accuracy of such certifications or documents, the application of amounts paid
pursuant to such certifications by the Persons to which they are paid, or the
sufficiency of Escrow Funds credited to the Escrow to make the payments herein
required. This Agreement expressly sets forth the duties and obligations of
Escrow Agent and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against Escrow Agent.


                                  ARTICLE 3

                         MONEYS IN ESCROW; INVESTMENT

         Section 3.01. Except to the extent that and until Radio Unica is or
becomes expressly entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow
Funds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (i) Purchaser and Radio Unica
intend, and hereby inform Escrow Agent, that the Escrow shall constitute an
escrow account in which Radio Unica and its creditors have no legal or
equitable right, title or interest of any kind whatsoever, and (ii) all of the
Escrow Funds and any earnings thereon shall be the sole property of Purchaser.
Prior to any distribution of the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall be treated as the owner thereof and any
interest or dividends earned thereon for all purposes (including Tax
purposes).

         Section 3.02. Escrow Funds held by Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
invested and reinvested by Escrow Agent in short term money market funds
investing in direct obligations of the United States of America or repurchase
agreements containing such obligations or, in direct obligations of the United
States of America having maturities of 30 days or less, or short-term
securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or any
agencies or instrumentalities thereof, in either case, as Escrow Agent is
directed by Purchaser in writing. Such investments shall be registered in the
name of Escrow Agent and held by Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow and,
together with earnings thereon, shall constitute further Escrow Funds
hereunder. Escrow Agent may make investments through its investment division
or short-term investment department. Escrow Agent shall sell and reduce to
cash a sufficient amount of investments of the Escrow Funds whenever the cash
balance therein is insufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid
therefrom. Escrow Agent shall, without further direction from any Person, sell
such investments as and when required to make any payments from the Escrow
required to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Unless Escrow Agent is guilty
of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct with regard to its duties
hereunder, Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any loss
suffered in connection with any investment of moneys made by Escrow Agent in
accordance with this Article 3.

         Section 3.03. Escrow Agent shall furnish to Radio Unica and Purchaser
reports accounting for all investments and interest and income therefrom. Such
accounting shall be furnished no less frequently than every month and upon
request of Radio Unica or Purchaser.

                   ESCROW AGENT'S AUTHORITY; INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 4.01. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any writing or
instrument or signature which it, in good faith, believes to be genuine, may
assume the validity and accuracy of any statement or assertion contained in
such a writing or instrument, and may assume that any Person purporting to
give any writing, notice, advice or instructions in connection with the
provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. Prior to or concurrent
with the delivery and execution of this Agreement each of Purchaser and Radio
Unica shall deliver an incumbency certificate to Escrow Agent designating the
person or persons of such Party from whom the Escrow may accept written
instructions. Each incumbency certificate shall contain a specimen signature
of each person so designated and each of Purchaser and Radio Unica may update
or revise its incumbency certificate from time to time. Escrow Agent shall not
be liable in any manner for the sufficiency or correctness as to form, manner
and execution, or validity of any instrument deposited with it, nor as to the
identity, authority or right of any Person executing the same; and its duties
hereunder shall be limited to those specifically provided herein.

         Section 4.02. Unless Escrow Agent is guilty of gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct with regard to its duties hereunder, Purchaser and
Radio Unica hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify Escrow Agent and
hold it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, actions, suits
or proceedings at law or in equity, or any other expense, fees or charges of
any character or nature, which it may incur or with which it may be threatened
by reason of its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement; and in
connection therewith, to indemnify Escrow Agent against any and all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and the cost of defending any action,
suit or proceeding or resisting any claim. Escrow Agent shall be vested with a
lien on all property deposited hereunder for indemnification, for reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, for any suit, interpleader or otherwise, or any
other expenses, fees or charges of any character or nature, which may be
incurred by Escrow Agent by reason of disputes arising between Purchaser and
Radio Unica as to the correct interpretation of the Purchase Agreement or this
Agreement and instructions given to Escrow Agent hereunder, or otherwise, with
the right of Escrow Agent, regardless of the instructions aforesaid, to hold
the said property until and unless said additional expenses, fees and charges
shall be fully paid. The foregoing indemnities in this Section 4.02 shall
survive the resignation or substitution of Escrow Agent or the Termination
Date.

         Section 4.03. If Purchaser and Radio Unica shall be in disagreement
about the interpretation of the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement, or about
the rights and obligations, or the propriety of any action contemplated by
Escrow Agent hereunder, Escrow Agent may, but shall not be required to, file
an appropriate civil action to resolve the disagreement. Escrow Agent shall be
indemnified, jointly and severally, by Purchaser and Radio Unica for all
costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in connection with such civil
action, and shall be fully protected in suspending all or part of its
activities under this Agreement until a final judgment, without any further
right of appeal, in such action is received.

         Section 4.04. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any mistakes of
facts or errors of judgment, or for any acts or omissions of any kind, unless
caused by its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

         Section 4.05. Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its own
choosing, at the joint expense of Purchaser and Radio Unica, as to any matter
relating to this Holdback Escrow Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall not incur
any liability in acting in good faith in accordance with any advice from such
counsel.

         Section 4.06. Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not
performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility
hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the control of Escrow Agent
(including but not limited to any act or provision of any present or future
law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or war, civil
unrest, local or national disturbance or disaster, any act of terrorism, or
the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or facsimile or other wire
or communication facility).

         Section 4.07. Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the
Escrow Funds held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its
own similar property and shall not be required to invest any funds held
hereunder except as directed in this Holdback Escrow Agreement. Uninvested
funds held hereunder shall not earn or accrue interest.

         Section 4.08. In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder
or in any notice, instruction or other communication received by Escrow Agent
hereunder, Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any
action other than to retain possession of the Escrow Funds, unless Escrow
Agent receives written instructions signed by each of Purchaser and Radio
Unica, which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.

         Section 4.09. In the event of any dispute between or conflicting
claims among the Purchaser and Radio Unica and any other Person with respect
to any Escrow Funds, Escrow Agent shall be entitled, in its sole discretion,
to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with
respect to such Escrow Funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall
continue, and Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way to
Purchaser or Radio Unica for failure or refusal to comply with such
conflicting claims, demands or instructions. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
refuse to act until, in its sole discretion, either (i) such conflicting or
adverse claims or demands shall have been determined by a final order,
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, which order, judgment
or decree is not subject to appeal, or settled by agreement between the
conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to Escrow Agent or
(ii) Escrow Agent shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to
it sufficient to hold it harmless from and against any and all losses which it
may incur by reason of so acting. Any court order, judgment or decree shall be
accompanied by a legal opinion by counsel for the presenting party,
satisfactory to Escrow Agent, to the effect that said order, judgment or
decree represents a final adjudication of the rights of the parties by a court
of competent jurisdiction, and that the time for appeal from such order,
judgment or decree has expired without an appeal having been filed with such
court. Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinions without
further question. Escrow Agent may, in addition, elect, in its sole
discretion, to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief
or orders as it may deem, in its sole discretion, necessary. The costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such proceeding shall be paid by, and shall be deemed a joint
and several obligation of, Purchaser and Radio Unica.


                                  ARTICLE 5

                          ESCROW AGENT'S COMPENSATION

         Section 5.01. As partial consideration of Radio Unica's entering into
this Agreement, Purchaser hereby agrees to be solely responsible for and pay
Escrow Agent its annual (if applicable) fee for the services to be rendered
hereunder as provided in Exhibit B hereto. Any fees due to Escrow Agent,
including investment fees or other investment-related charges, may be deducted
by Escrow Agent from the investment earnings on the Escrow if Escrow Agent
provides Purchaser and Radio Unica with a listing of such fees in reasonable
detail. Any investment fees or investment-related charges in excess of
investment earnings will be paid by Purchaser.


                                  ARTICLE 6

                            CHANGE OF ESCROW AGENT

         Section 6.01. A national banking association located in the United
States of America or a state bank or trust company organized under the laws of
a state of the United States of America, qualified as a depository of public
funds, may be substituted to act as Escrow Agent under this Agreement upon the
agreement of Purchaser and Radio Unica. Such substitution shall not be deemed
to affect the rights or obligations of the Parties. Upon any such
substitution, Escrow Agent agrees to assign to such substitute Escrow Agent
its rights and obligations under this Agreement.

         Section 6.02. Escrow Agent or any successor may at any time resign by
giving notice by registered or certified mail to Purchaser and Radio Unica of
its intention to resign and of the proposed date of resignation, which shall
be a date not less than thirty (30) days after such notice is deposited in the
United States mail with postage fully prepaid, unless an earlier resignation
date and the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent shall have been or are
approved by Purchaser and Radio Unica. If Purchaser and Radio Unica are unable
to agree upon a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after such
notice, Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief.

         Section 6.03. Any corporation into which Escrow Agent, or any
successor to it of the duties and responsibilities created by this Agreement,
may be merged or converted or with which it or any successor to it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion,
consolidation or reorganization to which Escrow Agent or any successor to it
may be a party or any entity to which Escrow Agent may sell or transfer all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business, shall be the successor
Escrow Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper
or any other act on the part of the Parties, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.


                                  ARTICLE 7

deposited in the mail if delivered by mail, (c) the date sent if sent by
overnight courier, or (d) the date of transmission if delivered by telecopy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to Escrow Agent shall be effective only

         Section 7.03. Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code apply, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and to be performed entirely in such state without regard to principles
of conflicts or choice of laws or any other law that would make the laws of
any other jurisdiction other than the State of New York applicable hereto. The
Parties agree that, except as provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement,
without limitation of any Party's right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy
Court, upon the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (a) the Bankruptcy Court
shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and
to decide any claims or disputes which may arise or result from, or be
connected with, this Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the
transactions contemplated herein; and (b) any and all Claims relating to the
foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the
Parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.

         Section 7.04. Any provisions of this Agreement found to be prohibited
by law shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition, and shall
not invalidate the remainder of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement.

         Section 7.05. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

         Section 7.06. This Agreement may be simultaneously executed in
several counterparts (including with signatures transmitted by facsimile),
each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute but one
and the same Agreement.

         Section 7.07. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (the
"Termination Date") when Escrow Agent disburses all moneys held by it in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement upon the occurrence of the
following events:

                  (a) Purchaser and Radio Unica present one or more Payment
         Request Forms, Final Determinations, and/or written agreements
         contemplated by this Agreement to Escrow Agent and Escrow Agent pays
         one hundred percent (100%) of the Escrow Funds as directed by
         Purchaser and Radio Unica therein;

                  (b) The Parties mutually agree in writing with notice to
         Escrow Agent;

provided, however, that Section 2.04, Section 4.02, Section 4.03 and the
provisions of this Article 7, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         Purchaser and Radio Unica shall give Escrow Agent written notice that
the Termination Date has occurred as provided above together with instructions
to make any final disbursement provided for in this Section and Section 2.03.

         Section 7.08. This Agreement (and, with respect to Purchaser and

Section 7.09. To the extent permitted by law, the terms of this Agreement shall

specific instance and for the specific purpose given.

         Section 7.10. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the

action or other right.
