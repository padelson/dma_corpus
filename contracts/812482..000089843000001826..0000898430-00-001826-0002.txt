     concern, which owns or operates a hotel/casino within (A) the area commonly
     known as the "Summerlin" planned community development as it exists on the
     date of this Agreement, and (B) a five (5) mile radius of the location of
     the Business (with the exception of (I) the Las Vegas Strip (which is
     defined as that area bounded by Paradise Road and straight extensions
     thereof on the East, Charleston Boulevard on the North, I-15 on the West,

          (b)  The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies of
the various states of the United States may differ as to the validity and
enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section.  It is
the intention of the parties that the provisions of this Section be enforced to
the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and policies of each jurisdiction
in which enforcement may be sought, and that the unenforceability (or the
modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of any provisions of this
Section shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder of the
provisions of this Section.  Accordingly, if any provision of this Section shall
be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the operation of
such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is
made and not with respect to any other provision or jurisdiction.  If any of the
covenants contained in this Section 4.10, or any part thereof, is held to be
                            ------------
unenforceable because of the duration of such provisions or the area covered
thereby, Seller and Parent agree that the court making such determination shall
have the power to reduce the duration and the area or both of any such provision
and, in its reduced form, said provision shall then be enforceable.  The parties
hereto intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 4.10 upon the courts of any Nevada within the
                  ------------
geographical scope of such covenants.

                                     ------------
Parent and Seller hereby consent to the granting by any court of an injunction
or other equitable relief, without the necessity of actual monetary loss being
proved, in order that the breach or threatened breach of such provisions may be
effectively restrained.  Parent and Seller acknowledge and agree that the scope
and duration of the provisions of this Section 4.10 are reasonable in all
                                       ------------
respects.

not supercede or contradict in any manner the terms, conditions, covenants and
agreements contained in that certain Non-Competition Agreement dated as of
November 15, 1999, as amended, by and among Seller, Parent, Purchaser and the
various other parties thereto (the "Non-Competition Agreement").  To the extent

covenant or agreement of Seller under this Agreement to be breached or that

Agreement as if the same were made on or as of the date of such event,
transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this Section shall have

allocable, in accordance with the principles of Section 8.04(b) to that portion

exceptions deleted by Purchaser, and all matters disclosed by the Survey, a copy
of which has been provided to Purchaser, are hereinafter referred to as the
"Permitted Exceptions". The Permitted Exceptions shall also include those other
 --------------------
title exceptions which are disclosed or become apparent to Purchaser after the
date hereof, which are not already Permitted Exceptions, which cannot be removed
by the payment of a sum of money, which are not caused by the intentional act of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller after the date hereof, and which do not
materially adversely affect the value of the Real Property or Improvements, or
the continued use thereof as currently conducted, or as to which Purchaser has
not timely objected. Purchaser must notify Seller in writing of its objection to
any such subsequently arising matter on or before the date which is ten (10)
days after Purchaser's receipt of notice thereof.

          (b)    Seller shall cause all title exceptions (other than Permitted
Exceptions) not approved by Purchaser to be removed on or before the Closing.
Seller, however, shall have the right to (i) cause the Title Company to remove a
Lien by bonding over such Lien or (ii) obtain the commitment of the Title
Company to insure Purchaser against loss or damage that may be occasioned by
such exceptions that are not Permitted Exceptions.

          (c)    Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall obtain an ALTA extended
owner's policy of title insurance (Form B-1970) (Amended 4-6-90), issued by
Stewart Title of Nevada or if such title company is unable to do so, by a title
insurance company reasonably acceptable to Purchaser in its reasonable
discretion ("Title Company"), insuring that Purchaser has fee title to the Real

all endorsements and affirmative coverage customary in real estate sale
transactions involving the magnitude and type of the Transferred Assets
(including, without limitation, an ALTA 3.1 Zoning Endorsement) as Purchaser
shall reasonably request, and (iv) those exceptions arising after the Transfer
Time and approved by Purchaser as provided above (the "Title Policy"). The
                                                       ------------
coverage amount of the Title Policy for the Real Property and Improvements shall
be in an amount to be requested by Purchaser, which amount shall not exceed
$205,000,000. Purchaser shall have the right to require the Title Company to
obtain facultative reinsurance, with direct access provisions against the
reinsurer with respect to the Title Policy in such amounts and with such title
companies as Purchaser shall determine in its reasonable discretion.

          (d)    Seller shall pay the premium for the Title Policy and for all
endorsements thereto. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate diligently to provide
customary documents required by Title Company as condition to the issuance of
the Title Policy.

          (e)    Seller shall order an update of the Survey, which shall be
certified to Purchaser, the Title Company, and any other parties reasonably
requested by Purchaser. In addition, Seller shall cause the updated Survey to be
prepared and be certified as having been prepared in accordance with "Minimum
Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys" jointly
established and adopted by the ALTA and ACSM in 1997 and including all ALTA
optional items except No. 5 (Contour Maps) and No. 12 (Governmental Agency
Survey Requirements), and the updated Survey shall include a certification as to
whether or not the Real Property and Improvements are located in a floodplain or
designated floodway and such

          (a)  Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section and the other Sections

Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from

          (b)    Subject to the other Sections of this Article XI, Purchaser
                                                       ----------
shall indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them

Provided that this paragraph (c) shall not apply to a breach of a representation

          11.02. Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by
                 --------------------------
any Indemnified Party under Section 11.01 will be asserted and resolved as
                            -------------
follows:


          (a)    In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under Section 11.01 is asserted against
                                             -------------
or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or of Purchaser (a "Third Party Claim"), the
                                                      -----------------
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice
with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend

                                       44
<PAGE>

has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
to the Indemnified Party under Section 11.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party
                               -------------
desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim.

                 (i)    If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
     within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
     Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
     Section 11.02(a), then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
     ----------------
     defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at
     the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim
     by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and
     diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or
     will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with
     the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
     unreasonably withheld, in the case of any settlement that provides for any
     relief other than the payment of monetary damages as to which the
     Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full). The Indemnifying Party will
     be deemed to have waived its right to dispute its liability to the
     Indemnified Party under Section 11.01 with respect to any Third Party Claim
                             -------------
     as to which it elects to control the defense. The Indemnifying Party will
     have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
     or settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may,
                            --------  -------
     at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to
     the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first
     sentence of this Section 11.02(a)(i), file any motion,
                      -------------------
     answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified
     Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its
     interests; and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying
     Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the
     Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying
     Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
     elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to
     represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third
     Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section
                                                                       -------
     11.02(a)(i), and the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses
     -----------
     with respect to such separate counsel except as provided in the preceding
     sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and
     expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party's good
     faith judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the
     Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because a conflict
     or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
     Indemnified Party which makes representation of both parties inappropriate
     under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) the named parties
     to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the
     Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith, based
     on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are
     unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
     Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
     settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
     Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives
     its right to indemnity under Section 11.01 with respect to such Third Party
                                  -------------
     Claim.

<PAGE>

                 (ii)   If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the
     Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
     desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a), or if
                                                         ----------------
     the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously
     and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party
     will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the
     Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
     which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith
     or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with the
     consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
     withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and
     proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
     however, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
     will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide
     reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in
     contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.02(a)(ii), if
                                                      --------------------
     the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the
     Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability hereunder
     to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such
     dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner
     provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required
     to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant
     to this Section 11.02(a)(ii) or of the Indemnifying Party's participation
             --------------------
     therein at the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will
     reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and
     expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such
     litigation. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
     defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
     Section 11.02(a)(ii), and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs
     --------------------
     and expenses with respect to such participation.

                 (iii)  If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
     that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with
     respect to the Third Party Claim under Section 11.01 or fails to
                                                 -----------
     notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the
     Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
     respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss arising from such Third Party
     Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
     under Section 11.01 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
           -------------
     Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination
     thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with
     respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
     will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and
     if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such
     dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section
                                                                 -------
     11.02(c).

meet in Las Vegas, Nevada or such other place as a majority of the members of
the Board of Arbitration determines more appropriate, and shall reach and render
a decision in writing (concurred in by a majority of the members of the Board of
Arbitration) with respect to the amount, if any, which the Indemnifying Party is
required to pay to the Indemnified Party in respect of a claim filed by the
Indemnified Party. In connection with rendering its decisions, the Board of
Arbitration shall adopt and follow such rules and procedures as a majority of
the members of the Board of Arbitration deems necessary or appropriate. To the
extent practical, decisions of the Board of Arbitration shall be rendered no
more than thirty (30) days following commencement of proceedings with respect
thereto. The Board of Arbitration shall cause its written decision to be
delivered to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. Any decision made
by the Board of Arbitration (either prior to or after the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period) shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and entitled to be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law and entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Each party to any arbitration shall bear its own expense in
relation thereto, including but not limited to such party's attorneys' fees, if
any, and the expenses and fees of the Board of Arbitration shall be divided
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the same proportion
as the portion of the related claim determined by the Board of Arbitration to be
payable to the Indemnified Party bears to the portion of such claim determined
not to be so payable.

Seller and Purchaser will not issue or make any reports, statements or releases

transactions contemplated hereby of Governmental or Regulatory Authorities) or
by other requirements of Law or (ii) disclosed in an Action or Proceeding
brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its

                               OPTION AGREEMENT

          This OPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
                                       ---------
of __________, 2000 by and among SANTA FE HOTEL INC., a Nevada corporation
("Optionor"), STATION CASINOS, INC., a Nevada corporation ("Optionee"), and
  --------                                                  --------
SANTA FE GAMING CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation ("Parent").
                                                    ------

          WHEREAS, Optionor, Optionee, and Parent are parties to that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of June 12, 2000 (the "Purchase Agreement"),
                                                         ------------------
pursuant to which Optionor has agreed to sell, and Optionee has agreed to buy,
certain assets of Optionor relating to the operation of the Business.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given
such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

          WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, Optionee wishes to acquire an option to purchase the real
estate hereinafter described from Optionor, together with all improvements, if
any, situated thereon.

          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the cash payment made by Optionee
to Optionor pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Grant of Option.  Optionor hereby grants to Optionee, for a period of
          ---------------
three (3) years (the "Term") from the date of this Agreement, the exclusive
                      ----
option to purchase, upon the following terms and conditions, that certain parcel
of real property in the State of Nevada, County of Clark, more particularly
described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Option Property").
             ---------                       ---------------

     2.   Proof of Title.  Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a preliminary title
          --------------                      ---------
report issued by Stewart Title of Nevada (the "Title Company") covering the
                                               -------------
Option Property (the "Original PTR"). All title exceptions reflected on the
                      ------------
Original PTR (except those exceptions deleted by Optionee), and all matters
disclosed by a survey of the Option Property, a copy of which has been provided
to Optionee (except those matters specifically objected to by Optionee), are
hereinafter referred to as the "Permitted Exceptions". The Permitted Exceptions
                                --------------------
shall also include such other title exceptions which (a) are disclosed or become
apparent to Purchaser after the date hereof, and (b) which (i) are not already
Permitted Exceptions, (ii) cannot be removed by the payment of a sum of money,
(iii) are not caused by the intentional act of Optionor or any Affiliate of
Optionor after the date hereof, and (iv) do not materially adversely affect the
value of the Option Property, or as to which Optionee has not timely objected.
Optionee must notify Optionor in writing of its objection to any such
subsequently arising matter on or before the date which is ten (10) days after
Optionee's receipt of the PTR Update (as defined below) disclosing
<PAGE>

such additional exception. Within ten (10) days following Optionee's request at
any time during the Term of the option, Optionor shall deliver to Optionee an
update to the PTR (each, a "PTR Update").
                            ----------

     3.   Acceptable Title.  If the evidence of title revealed by the PTR or any
          ----------------
PTR Update shall meet the requirements specified in Paragraph 2 hereof, Optionee
                                                    -----------
shall have ninety (90) days after delivery to Optionor of Optionee's written
notice of Optionee's intent to exercise the option (the "Exercise Notice") in
                                                         ---------------
order to close its acquisition of the Option Property. If Optionee shall not do
so within such time period, this option shall terminate, and no part of the
consideration paid for this option shall be refunded to Optionee.

     4.   Nonacceptable Title.  If the evidence of title shall not meet the
          -------------------
requirements specified in Paragraph 2 hereof, and Optionee shall so notify
                          -----------
Optionor in writing in its Exercise Notice, specifying the title matters to
which Optionee objects, Optionor shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
such Exercise Notice to cure the defects, and will in good faith exercise
reasonable efforts to do so. If the defects are cured within that time and
notice thereof given to Optionee, Optionee shall have ninety (90) days after
receipt of such notice to close its acquisition of the Option Property. If
Optionee shall not do so within such time period, this option shall terminate,
and no part of the consideration paid for this option shall be refunded. If the
defects are not cured within the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, Optionee
shall have thirty (30) days after expiration of said thirty (30) day period to
exercise the option to purchase notwithstanding the defects by notifying
Optionor in writing. If Optionee shall not do so within that time, Optionor
shall promptly refund the full amount of the consideration paid for this option,
and this option shall terminate.

     5.   Payment of Purchase Price.  The purchase price (the "Purchase Price")
          -------------------------                            --------------
for the Option Property is $5,500,000, against which there shall be credited the
entire consideration paid for this option. Optionee will pay the balance of the
Purchase Price in cash upon the closing of the transactions contemplated herein
(the "Closing"). At the Closing, the parties hereto agree to make customary and
      -------
appropriate adjustments and prorations, and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall pay all costs and expenses as are usually
and customarily paid by purchasers and sellers of real property.

     6.   Delivery of Deed and Possession.  At Closing, Optionor will promptly
          -------------------------------
execute and deliver to Optionee a good and sufficient grant, bargain and sale
deed, with proper documentary stamps affixed thereto, conveying the Option
Property to Optionee, and an ALTA Extended Coverage Owner's Policy of Title
Insurance, reflecting only the Permitted Exceptions and other exceptions or
defects of title specifically approved by Optionee or permitted under this
Agreement, and with such endorsements as are reasonably requested by Optionee,
all at Optionor's expense, and shall at the same time deliver possession of the
Option Property to Optionee.

     7.   Adjustments.  Real property taxes and assessments shall be prorated as
          -----------
of the date of Closing.

     8.   Time of Essence.  Time is of the essence of this option.
          ---------------

     10.  Representations, Warranties and Covenants.  In addition to each of the
          -----------------------------------------
representations and warranties of Optionor and Parent relating to the Option
Property contained in the Purchase Agreement, each of which are incorporated
herein by reference, Optionor and Parent hereby represent, warrant and covenant

          (c)  There are no leases covering the Option Property;

          (d)  Optionor covenants and agrees to deliver to Optionee a list of

Optionor is a party or which would constitute a lien upon the Option Property
(the "Contracts") no later than ten (10) days after Optionee's request, for
      ---------
Optionee's review and approval. Such list shall be designated by Optionor, and
deemed upon delivery to Optionee, as a true, complete and correct schedule of
all of the Contracts. True, complete and correct copies of such Contracts shall
have been or shall thereafter be delivered to Optionee for Optionee's review
