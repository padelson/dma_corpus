 (b) Acquiror shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry in any Action brought by an Antitrust Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith with the Antitrust Authorities and other Governmental Authorities and undertake promptly any and all action required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including proffering and consenting to 

   ##### 

  

    

a Governmental Order providing for the sale or other disposition, or the
holding separate, of particular assets, categories of assets or lines of
business, of either assets or lines of business of the Companies, or any
other assets or lines of business of Acquiror. The entry by any Governmental
Authority in any Action of a Governmental Order permitting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby but requiring any of the assets or lines
of business of Acquiror to be held separate thereafter (including the
business and assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall not be
deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions specified in Section
9.1(b), 9.1(c), 9.1(d), 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c). 

  

 (d) Acquiror shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to the Antitrust Authorities or any other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.2 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time of the Mergers, Acquiror agrees that it shall cause each Surviving Corporation to continue to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the applicable Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time of the Mergers, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time of the Mergers, to the fullest extent that such Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable law and its charter or by-laws or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), _provided_ the person to whom such expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to such Surviving Corporation to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable law and the charter and by-laws or other organizational documents of such Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to TC Group, L.L.C. and such Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time of the Mergers, Acquiror shall, at Acquirors sole cost and expense, cause each Surviving Corporation to obtain "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time of the Mergers with respect to directors and officers, fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the applicable Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms not materially less favourable than the terms of such insurance coverage in effect on the date of this Agreement for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time of the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, such insurance shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporations Parent shall be obligated to obtain such "tail" insurance to the extent the cost of such "tail" insurance exceeds 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement by the Companies for such insurance (such 

   ##### 

  

    

300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such "tail" insurance coverage can
only be obtained at a cost in excess of the Maximum Premium, Acquiror shall
cause the Surviving Corporations to obtain and maintain one or more "tail"
policies with the most favorable coverage available for a cost equal to the
Maximum Premium. 

  

 6.3 _Continued Employment_. 

  

 (a) For a period of no less than one year following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause each Surviving Corporation to continue to provide the employees of the applicable Company and its Subsidiaries with employment at a level of salary, wages, bonus opportunities, commissions, if applicable, and benefits (other than equity based compensation) which in the aggregate are at least substantially equivalent to the salary, wages, bonus opportunities, commissions, if applicable, and benefits provided prior to the Closing Date by such Company or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee of continued employment of any employee of each Company or its Subsidiaries and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit each Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any employee of such Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or (ii) to require each Surviving Corporation to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time of the Mergers as long as Acquiror complies with its obligations hereunder. 

  

 (b) Benefits. 

   

 (i) Each employee and former employee of a Company and its Subsidiaries shall be credited with his or her years of service with such Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under any employee benefit plan of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries providing benefits similar to those provided under such Employee Plan to the same extent as such employee or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under such Employee Plan, except to the extent that such crediting would result in duplication of benefits and provided that no prior service credit shall be recognized for purposes of (A) benefit accrual, level of pay credits and/or grandfathering under any defined benefit plan or (B) post-retirement welfare benefits. 

   

 (ii) With respect to the calendar year in which Acquiror ceases to maintain any particular Employee Plan, each employee shall be given credit for amounts paid under such Employee Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Acquiror. 

   

 (iii) Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Companies and their Affiliates and any employee benefit plans which any of them sponsors or maintains for the benefit of their employees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements with respect to participation and 

   ##### 

  

    

coverage of employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries and their
eligible dependents in any welfare plan maintained by Acquiror, each
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, to the extent permitted by law
and to the extent waived under comparable Employee Plans. 

  

 6.4 _Financing_. Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and consummate the financing transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein (including, without limitation, any market-flex or other similar provisions), or, if such financing is not available, to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions that are substantially similar, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Acquiror be required to seek or obtain financing on terms and conditions that would be less favorable to Acquiror than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate in good faith respecting such financing, (ii) to satisfy all conditions provided in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements relating thereto, (iii) if any portion of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter has become unavailable, regardless of the reason therefore, to obtain alternative financing from the same or other sources on the terms specified above, and (iv) to satisfy at or prior to the Closing all requirements of any agreements relating to the Debt Commitment Letter which are conditions to closing under such agreements or to the drawdown of proceeds thereunder. Acquiror will give the Companies prompt notice of any breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter and shall keep the Companies informed as to the status of its efforts to arrange the financing transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Acquiror shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Companies (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied). 

  

 6.5 _DoT Matters_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Acquiror, at its own expense, shall arrange for and cause the consummation of the sale or other disposition of each of the Part 135 certificates held by Landmark or its Subsidiaries to a "citizen of the United States" as defined in 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40102(15) who is an Unaffiliated Person or to surrender such Part 135 certificates to the Federal Aviation Administration, such that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will comply with the regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (" _DoT_ ") relating to the ownership of such Part 135 certificates. Such disposition shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall be consummated immediately prior to the Closing. Acquirors obligations under this Section 6.5 shall be deemed to be satisfied by the transfer of such Part 135 certificates to the Voting Trust as contemplated by Section 7.4(a) hereof so long as prior to Closing Acquiror obtains all consents of Governmental Authorities required under applicable law to do so (including the consent of the DoT). 

  

 6.6 _Solvency Opinion_. Acquiror shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Companies copies of any solvency opinions or similar materials obtained from third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the financing thereof), it being acknowledged and agreed that Acquiror shall have no obligation under this Section 6.6 to procure any such opinions or similar materials. In no event shall the provisions of this Section 6.6 create any obligation on Acquiror to cause any such opinions or similar materials to be 

   ##### 

  

    

addressed to, or otherwise permit any reliance thereon by, any of the
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or boards of directors or
other similar governing bodies. 

  

 6.7 _SR Technics Group_. From the date hereof through the date of the Letter of Credit Termination Event, Acquiror agrees that it shall not distribute the capital stock of SR Technics Group or any cash proceeds or other property received in exchange for all or part of such capital stock or assets of SR Technics Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) or 10.1(c)(i) and the Companies and/or the Holder Representative have asserted a claim for monetary damages against Acquiror or the Merger Subs in connection therewith, the restrictions on distributions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent that the amount of the monetary damages asserted by the Companies and/or the Holder Representative exceed the face amount of the Letter of Credit and, for the avoidance of doubt, Acquiror shall be permitted to distribute any and all cash (or property having a fair market value) in excess of the amount by which the monetary damages asserted by the Companies and/or the Holder Representative exceed the face amount of the Letter of Credit.

   ##### 

  

    

agencies do not enter into the FBO Business Disposition Agreement and the
Closing nonetheless occurs, Acquiror shall use best efforts to cause Landmark
to consummate the FBO Business Sale Transaction with a purchaser that is not
an Affiliate of Acquiror in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i) through

Nothing in this Section 7.4(b) shall require Landmark or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any assistance to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the ongoing business or operation of Landmark or its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, the financing thereof). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary, neither the Companies nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses or other liability with respect to the FBO Business Sale Transaction prior to the Closing. Acquiror shall reimburse Landmark for any documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses paid by Landmark or its Subsidiaries (other than to its Affiliates) in connection with their cooperation pursuant to this Section 7.4, which shall be paid by Acquiror prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date following delivery by Landmark of an estimate and final calculation thereof (x) in accordance with Section 2.10 or (y) promptly following the termination of this Agreement.

the Standard Vested Options for certain limited purposes, as specified herein
(the " _Holder Representative_ "). The parties have designated the Holder
Representative as the initial Holder Representative, and approval of
this Agreement by the holders of Common Shares and Vested Options shall
constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons that collectively owned more than
fifty percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Landmark Common Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Mergers (" _Majority Holders_

The Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to it under Section 2.5 of this Agreement and/or has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement, from funds paid to it under Section 2.5 of this Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and for indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the funds paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to Section 2.5 exceed the Holder Allocable Expenses, the Holder Representative shall be entitled to retain such excess amount as a fee for its services as Holder Representative hereunder.
