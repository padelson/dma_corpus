has approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with Section 251 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and determined that the

for the stockholders of Parent to (i) authorize and approve an amendment to
Parents certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of
Parent Class A Stock that Parent is authorized to issue under Parents
certificate of incorporation to a number at least sufficient to enable Parent
to issue all the shares of Parent Class A Stock that will constitute Merger
Consideration or are otherwise required hereunder, including in _Sections
1.11_ , _1.12_ and _1.13_ (the "Parent Certificate Amendment"), and (ii)
authorize the issuance of Parent Class A Stock (and, if required Parents

(collectively, the "Parent Stockholder Matters");

WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Stuart

and conditions in that agreement, to vote the shares of Parent Stock held by
it to approve the Parent Stockholder Matters;

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, MP CA Homes LLC has entered into an agreement, pursuant to which

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 



3 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

AGREEMENT

ARTICLE 1 

_THE MERGER_

 

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time described in _Section 2.3,_ the
Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, the separate existence of
the Company will terminate, and Merger Sub will continue as the corporation
that survives the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger will have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, when the
Merger becomes effective, (i) the real and personal property, other assets,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of Merger Sub
will continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and will be the
property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and
franchises of the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the separate existence of the
Company will terminate, and the Companys real and personal property, other
assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises will
be merged into the Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Merger will have the
other effects specified in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.2 _Certificate of Incorporation_. From the Effective Time until it is
subsequently amended, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub
immediately before the Effective Time, except that it will provide that the
name of the Surviving Corporation will be "CalAtlantic Group, Inc." That
Certificate of Incorporation, separate and apart from this Agreement, may be
certified as the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.3 _By-Laws_. From the Effective Time until they are subsequently amended or
repealed, the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective
Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time and will hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.5 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective
Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time and will hold office until they resign or are removed or replaced by the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.6 _Stock of the Company_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 1.6(c), 1.14_ and _1.15_ , at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each share of common stock
of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), par value $0.01 per share, which is
outstanding immediately 

 



4  before the Effective Time will be converted into and become the right to
receive either (i) 0.885 duly authorized and issued and fully paid and non-
assessable shares (the "Merger Consideration") of Class A common stock of
Parent ("Parent Class A Stock"), par value $0.10 per share (the number of
shares of Parent Class A Stock to be issued with regard to a share of Company
Common Stock being the "Exchange Ratio") or (ii) the Cash Payment Amount
pursuant to _Section 1.15_.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or
held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and
each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub, immediately
before the Effective Time (collectively, "Excluded Shares") will, at
the Effective Time, be cancelled and cease to exist and no Merger
Consideration will be issued with respect to any of those shares.

 

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock will be issued as a result of
the Merger. Any holder of Company Common Stock who, but for this _Section
1.6(c)_, would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A
Stock will receive, instead of that fraction of a share, cash equal to the
Closing Date Market Value of a share of Parent Class A Stock times that
fraction (which fraction shall be rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form). The "Closing Date Market Value" of a share of
Parent Class A stock will be the last sale price reported on the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on the last NYSE trading day before the Closing Date.

1.7 _Shares of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, all the common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Stock") which is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
("Surviving Corporation Stock"). At the Effective Time, any certificate or
other document which evidenced shares of Merger Sub Stock will automatically
become and be a certificate or other document evidencing the same number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Stock.

1.8 _Preferred Share Purchase Rights_. At the Effective Time, all the
Preferred Share Purchase Rights ("Preferred Share Rights") that have been
issued under the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of December
20, 2011, between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights
Agent, as amended (including to substitute Computershare Inc., as successor
Rights Agent) (the "Rights Agreement"), will be cancelled and will cease to
exist, and no additional Merger Consideration or any other consideration will
be issued or paid with regard to the Preferred Share Rights.

1.9 _Company Convertible Debt_. At the Effective Time, all outstanding debt
of the Company which, by its terms, is convertible into Company Common Stock
will remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger, except that the holder
of such debt will receive, on conversion of the convertible debt held by it,
the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock equal to (a) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock the holder would have received if the Merger had not
taken place multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio; unless the indenture
relating to a particular issue of convertible debt provides otherwise, in
which case the holder of convertible debt of that issue will receive what is
provided in the indenture.

 



5 1.10 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant issued by the Company
which is outstanding at that time, will remain outstanding, and will be
exercisable and will expire in accordance with its terms, except that when it
is exercised with respect to a specified number of shares of Company Common
Stock, the holder will receive, instead of that number of shares of Company
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration for that number of shares of Company
Common Stock and the exercise price per share thereof will be correspondingly
adjusted.

 

1.11 _Options_. At the Effective Time, each option (each, a "Company Option")
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be automatically converted into an option to
acquire shares of Parent Class A Stock (a "Parent Merger Option"), on the
same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or
repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof pursuant
to the existing terms of the relevant equity plans of the Company or
applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby)
as were applicable under such Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in this  _Section 1.11_.
The number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to the Parent Merger
Option into which a Company Option is converted shall be equal to (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A
Stock, and such Parent Merger Option shall have an exercise price per full
share of Parent Class A Stock equal to (A) the exercise price of the Company
Option per share of Company Common Stock divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole cent; provided, that (1) in
the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of
the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code; and (2) the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Class
A Stock subject to, and the terms and conditions of exercise of each Parent
Merger Option shall also be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent
Merger Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Class A Stock subject
to such options and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding.

1.12  _Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units_. At the Effective
Time, each time-based or performance-based restricted stock unit award granted
under the equity plans of the Company (each, a "Company RSU")
representing the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a
right to receive shares of Parent Class A Stock (a "Parent Merger RSU"), on
the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions
or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration or other deemed
satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms

 



6  of the relevant equity plans of the Company or applicable award agreement by
reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such
Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of
shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to the Parent Merger RSU into which a
Company RSU is converted shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the
nearest whole share of Parent Class A Stock. At the Effective Time all
performance-based vesting criteria to which any outstanding Company RSUs are
subject for which the performance period has not yet been completed as of the
Effective Time shall be deemed achieved at the target performance level. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock for delivery
upon the vesting and settlement of Parent Merger RSUs. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares
of Parent Class A Stock subject to such restricted stock units and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such restricted
stock units remain outstanding.

 

1.13 _Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, each stock
appreciation right of the Company (each, a "Company SAR") based on shares of
Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right based on the
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be automatically converted into a
right based on the shares of Parent Class A Stock (a "Parent Merger SAR"), on
the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions
or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof
pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant equity plans of the Company or
applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby)
as were applicable under such Company SAR as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in this _Section
1.13_. The number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to which the Parent Merger
SAR into which a Company SAR is converted relates shall be equal to (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock to which the Company SAR related
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A
Stock, and such Parent Merger SAR shall have an exercise price per full share
of Parent Class A Stock equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock of the Company SAR divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up,
if necessary, to the nearest whole cent; provided, that the exercise price,
the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to which the Parent Merger SAR
relates, and the terms and conditions of exercise of the Parent Merger SAR
shall also be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code. If the holders of Parent Merger SARs are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Class A Stock on exercise of the Parent Merger SARs,
at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock
for delivery upon exercise of Parent Merger SARs, and as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares
of Parent Class A Stock that may be issuable on exercise of Parent Merger SARs
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statements (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such stock
appreciation rights remain outstanding.

 



7 1.14 _Adjustments_.

 

(a) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any or all classes of Parent
Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different type of
securities by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares, conversion or similar event, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to the Company
Common Stock or the Parent Stock with a record date between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted so that
the Merger will have the same economic effect on the holders of Company
Common Stock as that contemplated by this Agreement if there had been no such
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange, conversion,
similar event or dividend, and as so adjusted will, from and after the date
of such event, be the Exchange Ratio, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this _Section 1.14(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Class B Dividend completed in accordance with  _Section 1.14(b)_
shall be governed by such section and shall not result in an adjustment to the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to this _Section 1.14(a)_.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of what is said in _Section 1.14(a)_, if
Parent issues shares of its Class B common stock ("Parent Class B Stock" and,
together with the Parent Class A Stock, the "Parent Stock"), par value $0.10
per share, as a dividend with regard to the Parent Stock, that is payable to
holders of record thereof on a date between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time (the "Parent Class B Dividend"), (i) the Merger
Consideration will include, in addition to the Parent Class A Stock described
in  _Section 1.6_, the number of shares of Parent Class B Stock that would
have been issued as a dividend on the Parent Class A Stock included in the
Merger Consideration if that Parent Class A Stock had been outstanding on
the record date for the dividend, (ii) each reference in this Article 1 to
Parent Class A Stock will be deemed to include the shares of Parent Class B
Stock that are issuable as part of the Merger Consideration with regard to
that Parent Class A Stock, and (iii) each reference in this Article 1 to the
Exchange Ratio will be deemed to include the shares of Parent Class B Stock
that are issuable as part of the Merger Consideration with regard to that
Parent Class A Stock (except where such deemed substitution would not be
practical, such as in adjustments to the exercise price of Company Options,
and in such case, with equitable and proportionate adjustments in such
exercise price or other adjustment, taking into account the Parent Class B
Dividend).

1.15 _Cash Election_.

 

(a) Each person who is a record holder of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares) during the period beginning on the day the Registration
Statement becomes effective, and ending on the fifth business day, before the
day on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held (the
"Election Period") (provided, that if the Company Stockholder Meeting is
postponed or adjourned such that there is a new record date for the postponed
or adjourned Company Stockholder Meeting, the Election Period shall end on the
fifth business day before the day on which such postponed or adjourned
Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held), will have the option to
elect (a "Cash Election") to receive with regard to any or all of the shares
of Company

 



8  Common Stock held of record by that person, in lieu of the Merger
Consideration described in _Section 1.6(a)_, $48.26 in cash, without
interest, per share of Company Common Stock (the "Cash Payment Amount"),
subject to possible proration as provided in _Section 1.15(c)_. The option to
make a Cash Election will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth
business day before the day on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to be held (the "Election Deadline"), whether or not the Company
Stockholder Meeting is actually held on that day.

 

(b) At least 20 business days before the Election Deadline, Parent will cause
the Distribution Agent to transmit to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock at the close of business on the day for determining the holders of
record of Company Common Stock who are entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (or to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
at the close of business on another day that is not more than 60 days before
the day on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) a
notice of the Cash Election (which may be the Registration Statement) and a
form of election with respect to the Cash Election (the "Cash Election
Form"), in each case which is reasonably acceptable to the Company, which will
enable a record holder to specify the number of shares of Company Common
Stock, if any, as to which the record holder elects to exercise the Cash
Election. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Distribution Agent to make the notice of the Cash Election and the Cash
Election Form available to all persons who become record holders of shares of
Company Common Stock during the period between the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Election Deadline. In order to properly exercise
the Cash Election, a record holder of Company Common Stock must return to
the Distribution Agent, and the Distribution Agent must have received by the
Election Deadline, a completed and signed Cash Election Form, together with
the Certificate evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock as to which the
Cash Election is being exercised or an Agents Notice stating that such
shares of Company Common Stock have been transferred by book entry transfer to
an account established by the Distribution Agent for the purpose of receiving
Company Common Stock. A holder of shares of Company Common Stock who submits
a Cash Election Form will have the right to change or withdraw such holders
Cash Election at any time before the Election Deadline, but not after the
Election Deadline, in accordance with procedures set forth in the Cash
Election Form. After a Cash Election is validly made and not withdrawn with
respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, the holder thereof may not
revoke such Cash Election after the Cash Election Deadline.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all Cash
Elections shall automatically be deemed revoked upon termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 6_. Holders of shares of Company Common
Stock will receive the Merger Consideration described in _Section 1.6(a)_
with regard to all the shares of Company Common Stock as to which such holders
do not validly make, or withdraw, a Cash Election, or to the extent provided
in _Section 1.15(c)_.The Distribution Agent shall have reasonable discretion
to determine if any Cash Election is not properly made or withdrawn with
respect to any share of Company Common Stock (none of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Distribution Agent being under any duty to notify any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock of any such defect). In the event the
Distribution Agent makes such a determination, such Cash Election shall be
deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by
such Cash Election shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration,

 



9  unless a valid Cash Election Form is thereafter timely delivered and
received with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) The aggregate amount the Surviving Corporation will pay as a result of
Cash Elections will be limited to $1,162,250,000 (the "Maximum Cash Amount").
If the total amount the Surviving Corporation would be required to pay if it
paid the Cash Payment Amount with regard to all the shares of Company Common
Stock as to which valid Cash Elections are made and not withdrawn would
exceed the Maximum Cash Amount, each holder of Company Common Stock who makes
a valid Cash Election that is not withdrawn will receive (i) the Cash Payment
Amount with regard to the number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
the number of shares as to which the Cash Election was made by such holder,
_multiplied by_ a fraction, of which (x) the numerator is the Maximum Cash
Amount, and (y) the denominator is (A) the Cash Payment Amount,  _multiplied
by_ (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which valid
Cash Elections are made and not withdrawn, and (ii) the Merger Consideration
with regard to the remaining shares of Company Common Stock as to which such
holder of Company Common Stock made a Cash Election. Parent and the Company,
in their reasonable discretion, shall have the joint right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with this Agreement and the DGCL, with
respect to the manner and extent to which Cash Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations pursuant to this _Section 1.15(c)_.

 

(d) Not more than two business days after the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, Parent will deliver to the Distribution Agent cash in the amount
equal to the Maximum Cash Amount (or such lesser amount as is necessary to
enable the Distribution Agent to distribute the Cash Payment Amount with
regard to all the shares of Company Common Stock as to which the
Cash Election is validly exercised and not withdrawn). Promptly after the
Distribution Agent receives cash as provided in this _Section 1.15(d)_, the
Distribution Agent will distribute the cash to the holders of shares Company
Common Stock who are entitled to receive it hereunder.

(e) The provisions of the first sentence of _Section 1.16(b)_ and  _Sections
1.16(d)_ through _(h)_ will apply to cash and Merger Consideration to which
holders of Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Section 1.15_.

 

1.16 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will designate a bank or trust
company, with the Companys prior approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), to act as Distribution Agent in connection with the
Merger (the "Distribution Agent"). At, or immediately before, the Effective
Time, Parent will (i) provide to the Distribution Agent, or instruct the
transfer agent for the Parent Class A Stock to deliver to the Distribution
Agent upon request, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock required to
be distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an
amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to enable the Distribution Agent
to make all required payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares (and
additional cash at later dates to the extent it is required for payments in
lieu of fractional shares), in each case in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock. Until the Distribution Agent uses funds
provided to it to pay cash

 



10  in lieu of fractional shares, the funds will be invested by the Distribution
Agent, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, in short-term obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of
the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances issued by commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and
undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million (based on the most
recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available).
No such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of the cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock, or cash pursuant to 
_Section 1.15_, payable by Parent to the holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement. If, after Parent has delivered shares of Parent
Class A Stock to the Distribution Agent, it is reasonably determined that
holders of Company Common Stock will be entitled to fewer shares of Parent
Class A Stock, less cash in lieu of fractional shares or less cash pursuant to
_Section 1.15_, than the number of shares or amount of cash the Distribution
Agent is holding, the Distribution Agent will promptly return the excess
shares or cash to Parent. In the event that the number of shares of Parent
Class A stock delivered to the Distribution Agent will not be sufficient to
pay the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions payable
under _Section 1.16(b)_, or that the amount of cash distributed to the
Distribution Agent and held by the Distribution Agent will not be sufficient
to pay for fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock or will not be
sufficient to pay for all validly made and not withdrawn Cash Elections (in
any case whether because of losses on the funds invested by the Distribution
Agent pursuant to this _Section 1.16(a)_ or otherwise), Parent shall deliver
(or cause to be delivered) additional shares of Parent Class A Stock and/or
additional funds to the Distribution Agent in an amount equal to the
deficiency.

 

(b) The Distribution Agent will be deemed to be the agent for the holders of
the Company Common Stock for the purpose of receiving the Merger
Consideration, and delivery of shares of Parent Class A Stock to the
Distribution Agent will be deemed to be delivery to the holders of the Company
Common Stock (except that delivery to the Distribution Agent before
the Effective Time will be deemed to be delivery to the holders of the
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time). Until they are distributed, the
shares of Parent Class A Stock held by the Distribution Agent will be deemed
to be outstanding from and after the Effective Time (except that excess
shares returned to Parent as provided in _Section 1.16(a)_ will be deemed
never to have been outstanding), but the Distribution Agent will not vote
those shares or exercise any rights of a stockholder with regard to them. If
any dividends or distributions are paid with regard to shares of Parent Class
A Stock while they are held by the Distribution Agent, the Distribution Agent
will hold the dividends or distributions, uninvested, until shares of Parent
Class A Stock are distributed to particular former holders of Company Common
Stock, at which time the Distribution Agent will distribute the dividends or
distributions that have been paid with regard to those shares of Parent Class
A Stock to the former holders of Company Common Stock who are entitled to
receive the shares.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business
days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Distribution Agent to mail to each person who was a
record holder of Company

 



11  Common Stock at the Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal for use
in effecting the surrender of stock certificates representing Company Common
Stock ("Certificates") in order to receive the Merger Consideration, such
letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree. When the
Distribution Agent receives either (i) a Certificate, together with a
properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other documents
required thereunder, or (ii) an Agents Notice from The Depositary Trust
Company (an "Agents Notice") stating that shares of Company Common Stock
have been transferred by book entry transfer into an account established by
the Distribution Agent for the purpose of receiving Company Common Stock, the
Distribution Agent will promptly arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration (or a cash payment if required under _Section 1.15_) to
the holder of the shares formerly represented by the Certificate or
transferred by book entry to the Distribution Agents account or as
otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal or the Agents Notice.

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration issuable
upon the surrender of Certificates or book entry transfer of shares. If Merger
Consideration is to be distributed to a person other than the person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate is registered, the surrendered Certificate
must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the
person who surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for payment of any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
the tax has been paid. After the Effective Time, a Certificate which has not
been surrendered will no longer represent, and uncertificated shares
reflected on the records of the Companys transfer agent will no longer
constitute, stock of the Company, and instead will represent or constitute
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with regard to what had
been shares of Company Common Stock (and any dividends paid to holders of
record after the Effective Time with regard to the Parent Class A Stock that
constitutes the Merger Consideration).

 

(e) If the Distribution Agent believes, or Parent notifies the Distribution
Agent that it believes, that the Distribution Agent is required to withhold
any portion of the Merger Consideration (or any cash amount) payable to any
person under the Code, or any provision of any state, local or foreign tax
law, the Distribution Agent will withhold Merger Consideration with a Closing
Date Market Value equal to the sum the Distribution Agent is required (or that
the Distribution Agent or Parent believes the Distribution Agent is required)
to withhold and Parent will provide the Distribution Agent, in exchange for
the withheld Merger Consideration, cash with which to pay the required
withholding taxes to the applicable Taxing authorities. Any Merger
Consideration that constitutes a compensatory payment to the recipient may, at
the direction of the Distribution Agent, be processed through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system. Any Merger Consideration that is withheld as
permitted by this _Section 1.16(e)_ will be deemed to have been distributed
to the person from whom it is withheld. 

(f) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Corporation will accept, and will instruct the Distribution Agent to accept,
an affidavit and indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it instead of the
Certificate.

 



12 (g) At any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time,
Parent may require the Distribution Agent to return to Parent any funds and
any shares of Parent Class A Stock which have been provided to the
Distribution Agent but have not been disbursed to former holders of Company
Common Stock (including, without limitation, dividends received by the
Distribution Agent in respect of those shares of Parent Class A Stock), and
after the funds and shares have been returned to Parent, former stockholders
of the Company must look to Parent for issuance of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of the Certificates that formerly represented, or book entry
transfer of, shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(h) Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Distribution Agent will be
liable to any former stockholder of the Company for any Merger Consideration
or cash payment amount which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(i) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not record any
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and the stock ledger of the Company
will be closed. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or uncertificated
shares are presented for transfer, they will be cancelled and treated as
having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration (which will be paid upon
receipt of a properly completed letter of transmittal or an Agents Notice and
any other documents required thereby).

 

1.17 _Governance Matters_ 1.18 . Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and
Parent prior to the Effective Time, Scott D. Stowell will be elected to the
Parent Board as of immediately following the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Scott D. Stowell is unable or unwilling to serve as a
director on the Parent Board immediately following the Effective Time,
the Company Board may select another individual to serve on the Parents
Board as of immediately following the Effective Time, such person to be
reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of
Parents Board.

ARTICLE 3

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as disclosed or
reflected in (a) documents filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") at least two business days before the date of
this Agreement (other than disclosures regarding future risks made under the
caption "Risk Factors" or disclosures constituting forward looking statements
that were the subject of disclaimers) or (b) a section of the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with the execution of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (it being understood that
the disclosure of any information in a particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

(b) The Company has all corporate power and authority necessary to enable it
to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. All
corporate actions necessary to authorize the Company to enter into this
Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by it, other than
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of appropriate
Merger documentation as required by the DGCL, have been taken. This Agreement
has been duly executed by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

(c) Without limiting what is said in _Section 3.1(b)_, the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Company Board") has unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted this Agreement and
approved the transactions

 



14  contemplated by it, including the Merger, and declared that this Agreement
and the Merger are advisable, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the
Companys stockholders vote all the shares of Company Common Stock they own,
or as to which they for any other reason have voting power, in favor of
adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger; _provided_ , that such
recommendation was made subject to the understanding that the Company Board
may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if one is permitted by
_Section 4.8_ hereof. The determinations and recommendations of the Company
Board described in the first sentence of this  _Section 3.1(c)_ were made
after the Company Board received and considered an opinion of J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC ("J.P. Morgan"), as financial adviser to the Company, to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair
from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders.

 

(d) Assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the
consents described in _Section 3.1(e)_ and in  _Section 3.1-D_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter are obtained, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company or of any document to be delivered by the
Company in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be delivered
in accordance with this Agreement will violate, result in a breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of the Company, any agreement or instrument to which the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any of them is bound,
any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental
agency or any other regulatory or quasi-regulatory organization having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except violations,
breaches or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect upon the
Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" upon a
company means a material adverse effect upon (i) the consolidated financial
position, results of operations, assets, business or operations of the
applicable company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability
of the applicable company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without material delay or impairment;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the following shall not constitute,
either alone or in combination, a "Material Adverse Effect" or be taken into
account when determining whether a "Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or
would reasonably be expected to occur: (A) changes in the economy
or financial, credit or capital markets of the United States of America (the
"United States") in general, including changes in interest rates and
availability and cost of borrowings or other costs of financing, (B)
changes generally affecting the industry or industries in which that company
or its subsidiaries conduct their businesses, (C) changes in applicable law,
(D) changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations of
them, (E) changes in global or national political conditions (including the
outbreak or escalation of war or acts of terrorism) or any natural disaster,
(F) changes attributable to the execution, public disclosure or performance of
this Agreement or the announcement, pendency or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by it, including the institution of litigation
relating to or arising from the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, and the impact of the execution, disclosure or performance of this
Agreement on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with suppliers,
customers, employees, Governmental Authorities, business partners or similar
relationships, 

 



15  (G) the performance by the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries of
its obligations under this Agreement, (H) any action taken with the written
consent of the other party or that is required by the terms of this
Agreement, (I) any failure to meet any internal or third party estimates,
projections or forecasts of revenue, earnings or other financial performance
(but not the facts or circumstances underlying or giving rise to such
failure), (J) with respect to the Company, (x) any items set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter, or (y) any change, in and of itself, in the trading
price or trading volume of Company Common Stock on the NYSE, or (K) with
respect to Parent, (x) any items set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter or
(y) any change, in and of itself, in the trading price of either class of
Parent Stock on the NYSE; except to the extent that the effect of a change
described in one or more of clauses (A) through (E) materially
disproportionately adversely affects the applicable company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies engaged in
similar businesses, and then only to the extent of such disproportionality.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1-E_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, or consents, or other
governmental action, other than (i) the termination or expiration of waiting
periods under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (the "HSR Act"), if any, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (iii) the filing
with the SEC of the Joint Proxy Statement and any reports relating to
the Merger required to be filed under the Exchange Act and the rules under it
or and any other applicable state or federal securities, takeover and "blue
sky" laws, and (iv) such other filings, authorizations, approvals consents or
other action, the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect upon the Company, are required to permit the Company
to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement.

(f) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in each state in which it is required to be qualified,
except states in which the failure to qualify, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

(g) The only authorized stock of the Company is 600,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share. At the close of business on October 23, 2017 (the "Measurement Time"),
the only outstanding stock of the Company was not more than 111,500,000 shares
of Company Common Stock. All those shares have been duly authorized and
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as shown on _Section
3.1-G_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the date of this Agreement, the
Company has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable
securities, or any stock units, which are outstanding, and is not a party to
any other agreements, which require, or upon the passage of time, the payment
of money or the occurrence of any other event may require, the Company to
issue or sell any of its stock.

 

(h) Except as shown in _Section 3.1-H_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
regarding the voting of shares of Company Common Stock or committing the
Company to register shares of Company Common Stock under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities  

 



16  Act"). No holder of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company
is entitled under the Companys certificate of incorporation or By-Laws, or
under any agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party, to preemptive rights with regard to Company Common Stock or any other
securities issued by the Company.

 

(i) The Company and the Company Board have done all things necessary so that
(i) neither the execution of this Agreement nor the Merger or any other
transaction that is the subject of this Agreement will give any holder of
Preferred Share Rights any right to exercise those Preferred Stock Rights or
any other rights with regard to the Preferred Share Rights, and (ii) neither
Parent nor Merger Sub will be a "15% Stockholder" for purposes of the Rights
Agreement or the Preferred Share Rights.

 

(j) Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Company 10-K") which was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and _Section 3.1-J_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, together contain a complete list of all the
corporations and other entities of which, at the date of this Agreement, the
Company owns directly or indirectly more than 50% of the equity measured by
value or power to vote in the election of directors or persons performing
similar functions (each corporation or other entity of which a company owns
directly or indirectly more than 50% of the equity being a "subsidiary" of
that company), other than subsidiaries that, taken together, do not
constitute a significant subsidiary as that term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of
SEC Regulation S-X (a "Significant Subsidiary"). Except as to subsidiaries
that taken together do not constitute a Significant Subsidiary and are not
otherwise material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken together, each
subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and,
to the extent the concept is applicable, in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it was formed, all the shares of stock or other
equity interests in each of those subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly
owned by the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and, with
regard to stock of corporations or other equity interests in limited liability
entities, are fully paid and non-assessable, none of those shares or other
equity interests is subject to any preemptive rights, and neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities, or is a party to any other agreements, which require,
or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any
other event may require, the Company or any subsidiary to issue or transfer
any shares of or other equity interests in any subsidiary of the Company, and
there are no registration covenants or transfer or voting restrictions with
respect to any shares of or other equity interests in any of the Companys
subsidiaries.

(k) Except (i) as shown in _Section 3.1-K_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(ii) as described in the Company 10-Q, (iii) as required pursuant to any joint
venture arrangements entered into after June 30, 2017, or (iv) as part of the
normal conduct of business of the Company, at the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any subsidiary has any actual or contingent obligation
to make, after the date of this Agreement, an equity investment in any entity
(other than the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries), whether by purchasing
equity securities of the entity, making contributions to the capital of the
entity, paying sums owed by the entity (as a guarantor of the entitys
obligations or otherwise) or in any other manner.

 



17 (l) Since January 1, 2014, the Company has filed with the SEC all
forms, statements, reports and documents it has been required to file under
the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), or the rules under either of them.

 

(m) When the Company 10-K and the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the period ended June 30, 2017 (the "Company 10-Q") were filed with the
SEC, each of them, including the documents incorporated by reference in each
of them, contained in all material respects all the information required to
be included in it and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, the
financial statements included in the Company 10-K all were prepared, and the
financial information included in the Company 10-Q was derived from financial
statements which were prepared, in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, except that interim financial
information included in the Company 10-Q does not contain all the notes
required with regard to financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
and is subject to normal year-end adjustments) and present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries at the dates, and
for the periods, to which they relate.

(n) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls that meets
the requirements of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and maintains
"disclosure controls and procedures" and a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (each as defined in SEC Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act) that meets the requirements of SEC Rule
13a-15 and SEC Rule 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act. Since
January 1, 2014, the Company has not reported any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting which have not been remedied.

 

(o) At the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any material liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that
would be required to be reflected on, or disclosed in notes to, consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities reflected on or reserved
against in the balance sheet included in the Company 10-Q, (ii) liabilities
under borrowing arrangements disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements in the Company 10-K or to the financial information in the Company
10-Q, (iii) contingent obligations disclosed in the managements discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the
Company 10-K or the Company 10-Q, and (iv) payables and other liabilities
arising in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses since June 30, 2017.

 

(p) Since June 30, 2017 through the date of this Agreement, except for entry
into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the Company
and its subsidiaries have conducted their businesses, in all material
respects, in the ordinary course

 



18  consistent with past practice, and (ii) nothing has occurred or condition
exists that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

 

(q) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(i) the homes sold by the Company and its subsidiaries have at all times
complied in all material respects with all applicable building codes or
similar codes then in effect, (ii) there are no pending vendor recalls of
which the Company has been notified or otherwise is aware of products
incorporated in homes built by the Company or its subsidiaries, and (iii)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is the subject of any recalls
or recall notices from any product safety commissions regarding products
incorporated in homes built by the Company or its subsidiaries.

(r) The assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are sufficient in all
material respects at the date of this Agreement to enable the Company and its
subsidiaries to carry out their businesses as they are being conducted at the
date of this Agreement. 

(s) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has at all times since January 1,
2014 complied, and currently is complying, with all applicable laws, except
for such failures to comply that individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

 

(t) The Company and its subsidiaries have all governmental and non-

requirement under Environmental Law for the Company or a subsidiary to
remediate any environmental condition on any property currently or formerly

and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or loss of the ability to use
intellectual property rights of any other persons that are material to Parent
and its subsidiaries.

commercially reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance

to any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
in it or necessary in order to make the statements in it, in light of the

information in a particular section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub
each represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

(a) Parent and Merger Sub each is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub each has all corporate power and authority necessary
to enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval. All corporate actions necessary to authorize Parent and Merger Sub

it, other than obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and the filing of a
Certificate of Amendment increasing the number of shares of Parent Class A
Stock that Parent is authorized to issue and appropriate Merger documentation
as required by the DGCL, have been taken. This Agreement has been duly
executed by each of Parent and Merger Sub and is a valid and binding agreement
of each of them, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

(c) Without limiting what is said in _Section 3.2(b)_, the Board
of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it are fair to and in
the best interests of Parent and its stockholders, (ii) adopted
this Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated by it, including
the Merger, and declared that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable, and
(iii) resolved to recommend that Parents stockholders vote all the shares of
Parent Class A or Class B common stock they own, or as to which they for any
other reason have voting power, in favor of adopting this Agreement and
approving the Parent Stockholder Matters; _provided_ , that such
recommendation was made subject to the understanding that the Parent Board
may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if one is permitted by
_Section 4.9_. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and
has declared this Agreement to be advisable, and Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved the
transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger.

 

(d) Assuming the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the consents
described in  _Section 3.2-D_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter are obtained,
neither the execution

 



26  and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or of any document
to be delivered by Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any
document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will violate,
result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, the Certificate
of Incorporation or By-Laws of Parent, any agreement or instrument to which
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is a party or by which any of them is
bound, any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or other
governmental agency or any other regulatory or quasi-regulatory organization
having jurisdiction over Parent or any of its subsidiaries, except violations,
breaches or defaults that, individually or in aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect upon Parent
before or after the Merger.

laws, and (vi) such other filings, authorizations, approvals, consents or
other action, the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, are required to permit Parent and Merger
Sub to fulfill all their obligations under this Agreement.

(f) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub has not, and on
the Effective Time will not have, engaged in any activities or incurred,
directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities, except the activities
relating to or contemplated by this Agreement and obligations or liabilities
incurred in connection with those activities and with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub is directly and wholly owned by
Parent. Parent has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities which are outstanding, and is not a party to any other
agreements, other than this Agreement, which require, or upon the passage of
time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any other event may require,
Merger Sub or Parent to issue or sell any equity interest in Merger Sub.

(g) Parent and each of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in each state in which it is required to be qualified,
except states in which the failure to qualify, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect upon Parent.

non-assessable. Except as shown on  _Section 3.2-H_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, at the date of this Agreement, Parent has not issued any options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, or any stock units, which
are outstanding, and is not a party to any other agreements, which require,
or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any
other event may require, Parent to issue or sell any of its stock.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
regarding the voting of shares of Parent Stock or, except for this Merger
Agreement, committing Parent to register shares of Parent Stock under the
Securities Act. No holder of Parent Stock or other securities of Parent is
entitled under Parents certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or under any
agreement to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party, to preemptive
rights with regard to Parent Stock or any other securities issued by Parent.

 

(j) Parent is not party to a rights agreement, poison pill or similar
agreement, plan or arrangement that could entitle any person to acquire stock
of Parent or any subsidiary as a result of the execution of this Agreement,

by this Agreement.

 

(k) Exhibit 21.1 to Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2016 (the "Parent 10-K") which was filed with the SEC, and
_Section 3.2-K_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, together contain a complete
list of all the corporations and other entities which at the date of this
Agreement are subsidiaries of Parent, other than subsidiaries that, taken
together, do not constitute a Significant Subsidiary. Except as to
subsidiaries that taken together do not constitute a Significant Subsidiary
and are not otherwise material to Parent and its subsidiaries taken together,
each subsidiary of Parent has been duly organized and is validly existing and,
to the extent the concept is applicable, in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it was formed, all the shares of stock or other
equity interests in each of those subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly
owned by Parent have been duly authorized and validly issued and, with regard
to stock of corporations or other equity interests in limited liability
entities, are fully paid and non-assessable, none of those shares or other
equity interests is subject to any preemptive rights, and neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries has issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities, or is a party to any other agreements, which require,
or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any
other event may require, Parent or any subsidiary to issue or transfer any
shares of or other equity interests in any subsidiary of Parent, and there are
no registration covenants or transfer or voting restrictions with respect to
any shares of or other equity interests in any of Parents subsidiaries.

(l) Except (i) as shown in  _Section 3.2-L_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

ended August 31, 2017 (the "Parent 10-Q"), (iii) as required pursuant to any
joint venture arrangements entered into after August 31, 2017, or (iv) as part
of the normal conduct of business by subsidiaries of Parent, neither Parent
nor any subsidiary has any actual or contingent obligation to make, after

 



28  the date of this Agreement, an equity investment in any entity (other than
Parents wholly owned subsidiaries), whether by purchasing equity securities
of the entity, making contributions to the capital of the entity, paying sums
owed by the entity (as a guarantor of the entitys obligations or otherwise)
or in any other manner.

 

(m) Since January 1, 2014, Parent has filed with the SEC all forms,
statements, reports and documents it has been required to file under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the rules under either of them.

(n) When the Parent 10-K and the Parent 10-Q were filed with the SEC, each of
them, including the documents incorporated by reference in each of them,
contained in all material respects all the information required to be included
in it and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in it, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Without
limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, the financial statements

(ff) Neither Parent, any of its subsidiaries nor Merger Sub owns any shares

reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies,
against such risks as companies engaged in similar businesses would, in
accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured.

on the day of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and at the Effective Time,

time the Joint Proxy Statement is distributed to the holders of the Company
Common Stock or the Parent Stock, or at the time of either Stockholders
Meeting, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
information supplied by Parent, or incorporated by reference to a document
filed by Parent with the SEC, in light of the circumstances under which it
was included in the incorporated document, not misleading.

4.2 _Parent Activities Until Effective Time_. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the time this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 6_, Parent will, and will cause its

may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iii) as required
by applicable law, or (iv) for sales of businesses other than Parents single
family homebuilding business, in each case, to the extent that it does not
require any amendment to the Registration Statement or delay the filing or
effectiveness thereof, or otherwise could be reasonably expected to result in
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 5_ not being timely satisfied.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the time this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 6_ , Parent will, and will
cause each of its subsidiaries to, except (x) as may be consented to in

_Section 4.2_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter:

the goodwill of its businesses and the continued employment of its executives

necessary in accordance with applicable law and its Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws to convene a special meeting of its stockholders (the
"Company Stockholders Meeting") as soon

 



40  as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and shall, subject to
the other provisions herein relating to the timing of such meeting, use its
reasonable best efforts to convene the Company Stockholders Meeting within 45
days after the Registration Statement becomes effective). Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, without the
consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting for up
to 30 days (or for such longer period as is required by law) (i) if as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock present or represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable law, (iii) for the distribution of any legally required supplement
or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement or (iv) to solicit additional
proxies if the Company reasonably determines that it is necessary or advisable
to do so in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to
_Section 4.8_, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies or votes sufficient to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Joint Proxy Statement will include the
recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders vote to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the "Company Recommendation"),
unless the Company effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 4.8_.

 

4.4 _Parent Stockholders Meeting_. Parent will take all action that is
necessary in accordance with applicable law and its Certificate
of Incorporation and bylaws to convene a special meeting of its stockholders
(the "Parent Stockholders Meeting" and together with the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the "Stockholders Meetings") as soon as practicable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval (and shall, subject to the other provisions herein
relating to the timing of such meeting, use its reasonable best efforts to
convene the Parent Stockholders Meeting within 45 days after the Registration
Statement becomes effective). Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent may, without the consent of the Company, adjourn or
postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting for up to 30 days (or for such
longer period as is required by law) (i) if as of the time for which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if the failure to adjourn or
postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of applicable law, (iii) for the distribution of any legally
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement, or (iv) to
solicit additional proxies if Parent reasonably determines that it is
necessary or advisable to do so in order to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval. The proxy statement distributed by Parent with respect to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting will be the Joint Proxy Statement and will include the
recommendation of Parents Board of Directors that its stockholders vote to
authorize and approve the Parent Stockholder Matters (the "Parent
Recommendation"), unless Parent effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to  _Section 4.9_. Subject to the preceding sentence, Parent will
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies or
votes sufficient to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall file
a Certificate of Amendment relating to the Parent Certificate Amendment with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly after receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval.

 



41 4.5 _Registration Statement/Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company will prepare a joint proxy statement for use in connection with each
of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting (such
proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Joint
Proxy Statement"). Parent will prepare and file with the SEC as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within 10 days
after (A) the pro forma financial information that is required to be included
in the Registration Statement is approved by Parents and the Companys
respective auditors for inclusion in the Registration Statement, and (B)
Parent receives all information to be provided by the Company for inclusion in
the Joint Proxy Statement), a registration statement on Form S-4 relating
to the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as a result of the Merger (such
registration statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement will include the Joint
Proxy Statement. Parent and the Company will cooperate to provide all
information which is required to be included in the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement in a timely manner so the Registration Statement can
be filed with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within 10 days after the pro forma financial information
that is required to be included in the Registration Statement is approved by
Parents and the Companys respective auditors for inclusion in the
Registration Statement) _._ Parent will cause the portions of the Registration
Statement other than the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent and the Company
will cause the Joint Proxy Statement, to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and forms under them. Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company will cooperate with Parent, to cause
the Registration Statement to be declared effective as promptly as
practicable after it is filed (including without limitation, promptly
responding to any comments from the SEC staff with respect to the Registration
Statement) and to keep it effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary state
securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties will notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the staff of the SEC and of
any requests by the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional
information and each party will promptly supply the other party with copies of
(i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the
Registration Statement; _provided_ that no response to any oral or written
request by the staff of the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, of all such comments).

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
or Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company or Parent, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon (and good

 



42  faith consideration by Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such
comments); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may amend or supplement
the Joint Proxy Statement without the review or comment of Parent in the
event of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and Parent may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement without review or comment by the Company
in the event of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. If at any time after
the Registration Statement becomes effective and prior to the Closing, an
event occurs with respect to Parent and its subsidiaries or with respect to
the Company and its subsidiaries that Parent or the Company reasonably
determines is required to be described in the Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such document would include in all
material respects all the information required to be included in it and would
at the time of the Stockholders Meetings not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that determines such information is required will
promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
containing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law or requested by the staff of the SEC, Parent and the
Company will each distribute the amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement to the holders of its common stock as promptly as practicable.
Except as set forth in this _Section 4.5(b)_, neither Parent nor the Company
will make any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or to the
Joint Proxy Statement without the approval of the other of them, which
approval will not be withheld or delayed unless the party withholding the
approval reasonably determines that the amendment or supplement would be
inaccurate or misleading in a material respect or would violate this
Agreement.

 

(c) Parent will notify the Company promptly after it receives notice that the
Registration Statement has become effective or that a stop order has been
issued with regard to the Registration Statement.

(d) The Company will not take any action, other than terminating this
Agreement if it is entitled to do so under _Article 6_ , which prevents the
holders of the Company Common Stock from voting on a proposal to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 4.8_; provided
that such Company Adverse Recommendation Change will not be a basis for the
Company to cancel the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise attempt to
prevent the holders of the Company Common Stock from having an opportunity to
vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, unless such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change results in termination of this
Agreement under _Article 6_.

(e) Parent will not take any action, other than terminating this Agreement if
it is entitled to do so under _Article 6_ , which prevents the holders of the
Parent Stock from voting on the Parent Stockholder Matters. Without limiting
what is said in the preceding sentence, a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change will not be a basis for Parent to cancel the Parent Stockholders
Meeting or otherwise attempt to prevent the holders of Parent Stock from
having an opportunity to vote on the Parent Stockholder Matters.

 



43 4.6 _HSR Act Filings_. The Company and Parent will each make as promptly as
practicable the filing, if any, it is required to make under the HSR Act with
regard to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement and each of
them will take all reasonable steps within its control (including providing
information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice) to
cause any waiting periods required by the HSR Act to be terminated or to
expire as promptly as practicable. If a filing under the HSR Act is required,
the Company and Parent will each provide information and cooperate in all
other respects to assist the other of them in making its filing under the HSR
Act.

4.7 _No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from Others_.

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 4.7_ and _Section 4.8_, (i)
the Company will terminate all ongoing discussions regarding Company
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise regarding possible Company Acquisition
Transactions, and (ii) except as provided in _Section 4.7(b)_, the Company
will not, and will not authorize or approve and will use its reasonable best
efforts to prevent, any of its or its subsidiaries officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant acting on its behalf), directly or indirectly to
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (by
making available non-public information or otherwise) any inquiry or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to (A) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, or
(B) any purchase of or tender or exchange offer for all or any significant
portion of the Companys equity securities, or (C) any purchase of all or,
except in the ordinary course of business, a significant portion of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (each of these
being a "Company Acquisition Transaction," and a proposal to enter into a
Company Acquisition Transaction, whether made to the Company or its
stockholders, being a "Company Acquisition Proposal"); _provided_ , _however_
, nothing contained herein shall prohibit an interaction with a Potential
Acquiror solely to clarify the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition
Proposal the Potential Acquiror has made.

 

(b) S _ection 4.7(a)_ will not prevent the Company from, in response to a
Company Acquisition Proposal which the Company receives despite complying
with _Section 4.7(a)_ in all material respects, and which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor, constitutes or would be reasonably expected to result in,
a transaction which would be more favorable to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger, furnishing non-public information (after receipt of an
Appropriate Confidentiality Agreement) to the person, entity or group (the
"Potential Acquiror") which makes the Company Acquisition Proposal and
entering into discussions and negotiations with that Potential Acquiror.

 

(c) If at any time, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal or a
request for non-public information in connection with a Company Acquisition
Proposal, or an indication that a Potential Acquiror intends to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within two
business days after the Company receives the Company Acquisition Proposal,
request for non-public information or indication of intent to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal, the Company will inform Parent about such Company
Acquisition Proposal, request or indication, including the identity of the
Potential Acquiror from

 



44  which the Company Acquisition Proposal, request or indication was received,
and a reasonably detailed description of its material terms, and the Company
will promptly, from time to time, provide Parent with any additional
information the Company obtains regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal,
request or notification from the Potential Acquiror, and otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of such possible Company Acquisition
Proposal.

4.8 _Company Board Recommendation._

 

(a) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(1) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or to the Merger, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub or the Merger, the Company Recommendation, or (2) publicly propose
to approve or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal (any of such
actions, other than a customary "stop, look and listen" communication, a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (ii) authorize the Company
to enter into a binding agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.8_, if, prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Boards exercise
of its fiduciary duties, the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or a Company
Intervening Event, or (B) authorize the entry into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, and cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_ and
concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_ unless:

(i) the Company gives Parent written notice of its intention to give a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change because of a Company Intervening Event
at least five business days before effecting the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or gives Parent a Superior Proposal Notice in
accordance with _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_;

(ii) if the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is because of a
Company Intervening Event, and, if Parent asks the Company to do so, the
Company engages in good faith discussions with Parent during the five business
day period about possible changes to the terms of this Agreement that would
cause the Company Board not to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
and

(iii) if the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in order to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_, (A) if Parent asks
the Company to do so, the Company shall engage in good faith discussions with
Parent during the three NYSE trading day period set forth in _Section
6.1(f)(iv)_ (or

 



45  such shorter period provided by _Section 6.1(f)(v))_ about possible changes
to the terms of this Agreement that would cause the Company Board to determine
that the Superior Proposal that is the subject of the notice under _Section
6.1(f)(iv)_ is no longer a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent fails to give the
Company a Consideration Increase Notice by the time provided in _Section
6.1(f)(iv)_ and  _(v)_ , or if such notice is delivered, the Company Board in
good faith determines after consultation with its financial advisor and
consideration of the changes proposed by Parent in the Consideration Increase
Notice, that the Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal.

(c) As used in this Agreement, a "Company Intervening Event" means an event
or circumstance that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the
Company Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), of which the
Company Board becomes aware before the Company Stockholder Approval, which
event or circumstance or its consequences materially increases the value of
the Company and its subsidiaries and that does not relate to (A) a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (B) Parent or its subsidiaries (including any Material
Adverse Effect as it relates to Parent), (C) actions taken pursuant to this
Agreement, (D) changes in the price of Company Common Stock or Parent Stock
(but not the facts or circumstances underlying or giving rise to such change
in the price of Company Common Stock), (E) changes in applicable law, (F)
changes in GAAP or other applicable accounting rules, (G) changes generally
affecting an industry or industries in which the Company or Parent or their
respective subsidiaries conduct business, (H) changes in global or national
political conditions (including the outbreak or escalation of war or acts of
terrorism), or (I) changes in economic conditions in the United States or
regions in which the Company or Parent or their subsidiaries do business.

4.9 _Parent Board Recommendation._

 

(a) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by _Section 4.9(b)_,
neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to the Company or the Merger, or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company or the Merger, the
Parent Recommendation (any of such actions, a "Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.9_, if, prior
to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards exercise of
its fiduciary duties, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change because of a Parent Intervening Event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parent Board may not make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
unless Parent gives the Company written notice at least five business days
before effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, if the Company
requests that it do so, Parent engages in good faith discussions with the
Company during the five business day period about possible changes to the
terms of this Agreement that would cause the Parent Board not to make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



46 (c) As used in this Agreement, a "Parent Intervening Event" means an event
or circumstance that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the
Parent Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), of which the
Parent Board becomes aware before the Parent Stockholder Approval, which
event or circumstance or its consequences materially increases the value of
Parent and its subsidiaries, and that does not relate to (A) the Company or
its subsidiaries (including any Material Adverse Effect as it relates to the
Company), (B) any actions taken pursuant to this Agreement, (C) any changes in
the price of Company Common Stock or Parent Stock (but not the facts or
circumstances underlying or giving rise to such changes in the price of
Parent Stock), (D) changes in applicable law, (E) changes in GAAP or other
applicable accounting rules, (F) changes generally affecting an industry or
industries in which the Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries
conduct business, (G) changes in global or national political conditions

Company or Parent or their subsidiaries do business.

4.10 _Company s Cooperation with Regard to Financing_. The Company will, and
will cause its and its subsidiaries officers and employees to, cooperate in
all reasonable respects with the efforts of Parent to arrange any financing
that it expects to use in connection with the Merger or after the Effective
Time, provided that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to carry out the
Merger are not conditioned on any such financing being arranged.

 

4.11 _Return of Materials Subject to Confidentiality Agreements_. As promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
applicable confidentiality agreements, the Company will request that any
person (other than Parent) that holds confidential materials provided by or on
behalf of the Company during the two years prior to the date of
this Agreement under a confidentiality agreement entered into in connection
with a possible Company Acquisition Transaction promptly return such materials
or destroy such confidential material.

 

4.12 _Communications to Company Employees_. The Company shall provide Parent
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form of any written
statements to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries informing them

contemplated by  _Section 9.3_.

4.13 _Defense Against Litigation_. If litigation is instituted against any of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates seeking
to prevent the Merger or to obtain damages if the Merger takes place, (i)
whichever of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub is a defendant in the
litigation will promptly notify the other (or others) of them of the
commencement of the litigation and will keep the other (or others) of them
informed of all material developments in the litigation or efforts to resolve
it, and (ii) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, whether or not it is
a defendant in the litigation, will, at its own cost, cooperate in all
reasonable ways with the efforts by the other or others of them to cause the
litigation to be dismissed or otherwise resolved on a basis that does not
interfere with the ability of the Merger to timely take place when and as
contemplated by this Agreement or result in an award of damages against any of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective

 



47  affiliates. The Company will not settle any such litigation on a basis that
requires the payment of money (including payment of fees or other sums to the
plaintiffs counsel) without Parents consent, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

4.14 _Efforts of Parent and Merger Sub to Fulfill Conditions_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section 4.9_), Parent and

consummate the Merger.

to the specified date or period), except where failures of such

 _TERMINATION_

6.1  _Right to Terminate_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time (whether or not the Companys stockholders, Parents
stockholders or both of them have given the Company Stockholder Approval or
the Parent Stockholder Approval):

(a) By written mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

 

(b) By either the Company or Parent if the Closing Date does not occur on or
before May 31, 2018 (the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Closing Date does not occur by the third business day before the Outside
Date because the condition set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ or _Section 5.2(c)_
has not have been satisfied or waived, either the Company or Parent may, by a
notice given to the other of them by the third business day prior to May 31,
2018, extend the Outside Date by up to an additional three months to a date
not later than August 31, 2018, which date shall thereafter be considered the
Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party
whose breach of a provision of this Agreement has been a material cause of,
or a material factor that resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
prior to the Outside Date.

 



50 (c) By either the Company or Parent if (i) any applicable law is in
effect that would make the Merger unlawful, or (ii) any order of any court or
other Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction is entered
permanently enjoining the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the
Merger and such order has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(c)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement was a material cause of, or a material factor
that resulted in, the imposition of any such order or the failure of such
order to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable.

 

(d) By either the Company or Parent if the Company Stockholders Meeting is
held, but at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the Companys stockholders do not give the Company
Stockholder Approval.

(e) By either the Company or Parent if the Parent Stockholders Meeting is
held, but at the Parent Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, Parents stockholders do not give the Parent Stockholder
Approval.

 

(f) By the Company if:

 

(i) There exists a breach or failure to perform of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 5.1_ if occurring or continuing
at the Effective Time, and (B) is incapable of being cured, or if capable of
being cured, is not cured by the earlier of (1) one business day prior to the
Outside Date, and (2) 30 days after Parent receives written notice of such
breach from the Company (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of such breach and the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
if such breach is not cured); _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(f)(i)_ at a
time when the Company is in breach of obligations under this Agreement and
that breach would result in a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
5.2(b)_.

 

(ii) All of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.2_ have been satisfied or
waived, but Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by the
time the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_, which
failure is a breach of Parent and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(iii) Prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent
Board effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. 

(iv) The Company has complied in all material respects with _Section 4.7_,
and despite that, before the Companys stockholders have given the Company
Stockholder Approval,

(A) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal, including a
Potential Acquiror commencing a cash tender offer or an exchange offer for all
or a majority of the outstanding Company Common

 



51  Stock (other than any Company Common Stock already owned by the Potential
Acquiror), that the Company Board determines in good faith to be a Superior
Proposal;

 

(B) the Company gives Parent a notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (x)
describing the terms of the Superior Proposal (including the consideration
per share of Company Common Stock the Companys stockholders would receive as
a result of the Superior Proposal), and (y) stating that unless Parent agrees
to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company
Acquisition Proposal that had been determined to be a Superior Proposal is no
longer a Superior Proposal, the Company intends to terminate this Agreement in
order to enter into the transaction that is the subject of the Superior
Proposal;

(C) either (x) Parent does not, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the third NYSE
trading day after the day on which the Superior Proposal Notice is given,
give the Company a notice (a "Consideration Increase Notice") that Parent will
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement as set forth in such
Consideration Increase Notice, or (y) if a Consideration Increase Notice is
provided, the Company Board in good faith determines after consultation with
its financial advisor and consideration of the changes proposed by Parent in
the Consideration Increase Notice, that the Company Acquisition Proposal it
had determined to be a Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal;
and

 

(D) the Company provides written notice of termination of this Agreement and
pays Parent the Company Termination Fee (defined below).

(v) For the purposes of Section _6.1(f)(iv)_ :

 

(A) A "Superior Proposal" is a Company Acquisition Proposal, which (v) is not
subject to the outcome of due diligence or any other form of investigation,
(w) is not subject to a financing contingency, (x) is from a Potential
Acquiror which the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith after
consultation with its independent financial advisor has the financial
resources necessary to carry out the transaction, (y) is not reasonably likely
to be the subject of regulatory concerns that could prevent or materially
delay completion of the transaction that is the subject of the Acquisition
Proposal or acceptance of Company Common Stock that is tendered in response to
the tender or exchange offer, and (z) the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor, and
taking account of, among other things, the value to the holders of Company
Common Stock of the ability, if the Merger takes place, to participate in the
synergy benefits resulting from the Merger, to be more favorable to the
holders of the Company Common Stock than the Merger.

 



52 (B) If the Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice or the notice
described in _Section 4.8(b)(i)_ before the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice or such other notice will
automatically postpone the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (and, if
it has not already taken place, the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting)
until the third NYSE trading day after the last day of the period during which
Parent can deliver a Consideration Increase Notice, or the Company is required
to enter into discussions regarding the Company Intervening Event under
_Section 4.8(b)(ii)_, unless the Company and Parent agree that it should be
held on an earlier date. When the Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice,
(i) the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under _Article 1_ and _Sections
4.4_ , _4.5_ , _4.6_ and _4.14_ will be suspended and (ii) the obligations of
the Company under _Sections 4.3_, _4.5_ , _4.6_ and _4.15_ will be suspended,
in each case, until the date the Company withdraws such Superior Proposal
Notice.

(C) If, after Parent has given a Consideration Increase Notice, the Potential
Acquiror modifies its Company Acquisition Proposal so the Company Board
determines the modified Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal,
the Company will be required on up to two further occasions to deliver a new
Superior Proposal Notice, and the provisions of _Section 6.1(f)(iv)_ and this
_Section 6.1(f)(v)_ will apply to the modified Company Acquisition Proposal
in the same manner they applied to the original Company Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board had previously determined to be a Superior Proposal,
except that the period in which Parent can deliver a Consideration Increase
Notice and the period in which the Company is required to negotiate
with Parent need not be later than one NYSE trading day after the day on
which the related Superior Proposal Notice is given.

 

(g) By Parent if:

 

(i) There exists a breach or failure to perform of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 5.1_ if occurring or continuing at the
Effective Time, and (B) is incapable of being cured, or if capable of being
cured, is not cured by the earlier of (1) one business day prior to the
Outside Date, and (2) 30 days after the Company receives written notice of
such breach from Parent (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of such breach and Parents intention to terminate this Agreement if
such breach is not cured); _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(g)(i)_ at a time when
Parent or Merger Sub is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that would result in a failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 5.1(b)_.

 



53 (ii) All of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ have been satisfied or
waived, but the Company has failed to consummate the Merger by the time the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_, which failure is a
breach of the Companys obligations under this Agreement.

 

(iii) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(iv) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (x) the Company
fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the Merger within ten
business days after the date a Company Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto is first publicly announced, following a written request
by Parent to make such public affirmation (which Parent may only request one
time with respect to each such proposal or modification), or (y) any person
other than Parent or its affiliates commences a tender offer or exchange offer
for 50% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock and either (A) the
Company Board or a committee of the Company Board recommends that the
Companys stockholders tender all or a portion of their Company Common Stock
in response to the tender offer or exchange offer, or (B) the Company does
not within ten business days after the tender or exchange offer is commenced
file with the SEC a Statement on Schedule 14D-9 which contains a
recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders not tender
their Company Common Stock in response to the tender or exchange offer.

6.2 _Manner of Terminating Agreement_. If at any time the Company or Parent
has the right under _Section 6.1_ to terminate this Agreement, except as
specifically provided in _Section 6.1_, such party may terminate this
Agreement by a notice to the other party that it is terminating this
Agreement, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination
is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail; _provided_
that no such notice shall be required for a termination under _Section
6.1(a)_.

 

6.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, following such termination, this Agreement
shall immediately become null, void and have no further effect and no party
will have any further rights or obligations hereunder; _provided_ that the
provisions of this _Article 6_ , _Article 7_ and  _Article 9_ (other than
_Section 9.3)_, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement; and _provided further_ , that no such termination shall
relieve any party from liability for a knowing and intentional breach of any
of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement prior to such termination,
subject to _Section 6.4_.

the Company Termination Fee.

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated

ARTICLE 8

_OTHER AGREEMENTS_

8.1 _Indemnification for Prior Acts_.

 

(a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) honor, and not to amend
or modify, and to indemnify and hold harmless and advance costs and expenses

 



57  pursuant to, and to the same extent as, any obligations of the Company or
its subsidiaries under any agreement or arrangement (including any provision
of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws or the Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws and similar organizational documents of any of the
Companys subsidiaries) in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
persons who at the Effective Time are current or former directors, officers,
agents or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified
Party") with respect to matters which occur at or prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) cause the Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advances of expenses of Indemnified Parties
for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement. Parent hereby guaranties the indemnification and expense
advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries
under such agreements and arrangements. Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six years after
the Effective Time, with respect to occurrences on or prior to the Effective
Time, the Companys policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") which are in effect on the
date of this Agreement and are listed on _Schedule 8.1_ (notwithstanding
any provisions of those policies that they will terminate as a result of the
Merger), or substantially similar insurance, which in each case will cover
each person covered by the Companys current DandO Insurance, to the extent that
insurance is available at an annual cost not exceeding 200% of the annual
cost of the DandO Insurance that is in effect at the date of this Agreement, and
to the extent that insurance is not available at an annual cost that will not
exceed such amount, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect for that period the maximum amount of such insurance
coverage that can be obtained for such maximum annual cost. The insurance
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
8.1_ will provide and contain benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage that are substantially equivalent to, and in any event no
less favorable to the insureds, than that provided in the Companys existing
DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) The provisions of this  _Section 8.1_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder will be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or
similar organizational documents of the Companys subsidiaries, the
Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, the
DGCL or otherwise. From and after the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 8.1_ may not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to any
Indemnified Party without such Indemnified Partys prior written consent.

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving 

 



58  Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this _Section 8.1_.

 

8.2 _Company Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on November
30, 2018, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to
be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary of either
of them (each a "Continuing Employee") either, at Parents election, (x)
compensation (including, without limitation, base salary or wage rate, bonus
or commission opportunity, cash incentive compensation opportunity and if the
Continuing Employee received equity compensation from the Company, equity-
based compensation opportunity) that is not less favorable in aggregate to the
Continuing Employee than the compensation the Continuing Employee was
receiving as an employee of the Company immediately before the Effective
Time or (y) the same compensation as that provided by Parent and its
subsidiaries to their similarly-situated employees (taking account of duties,
geographical location and any other relevant factors) during such period.

 

(b) Parent will provide each Continuing Employee with credit for all service
with the Company or its subsidiaries (including for purposes of this _Section
8.2_, any predecessor companies) as if such service were with Parent and its
subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, levels of
benefits and benefit accrual under the employee benefit and compensation
plans in which such Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time
to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of
the Company or its subsidiaries. Unused vacation days accrued by
Continuing Employees under the plans and policies of the Company and its
subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent. This _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or
require Parent to continue in effect any specific plan of the Company (or any
of its subsidiaries) or any Parent employee benefit plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, and without limiting the generality of
_Sections 8.2(a)_ and _(b)_ , with respect to any health plan (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes medical, dental, vision and prescription drug) of
Parent or its subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first
eligible to participate in the plan Parent shall, or shall cause its
applicable subsidiary to, cause any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or subsidiary plan to be waived
with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Company plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, any Continuing Employees who
participated in 401(k), health and welfare plans (which, for avoidance of
doubt, include medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, life insurance,
ADandD, disability insurance and flex spending), will be given the opportunity
to participate in the most nearly comparable plans maintained by Parent
through the end of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



59 (e) Parent shall honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each change
in control agreement and severance agreement that is in effect as of the date
hereof between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and current or former
employees or directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) the
parameters related to severance set forth on _Section 8.2-E_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(f) With regard to the annual cash bonuses relating to calendar year 2017:
(i) if the Effective Time occurs after February 28, 2018, the Company will pay
such bonuses no later than February 28, 2018, and (ii) if the Effective Time
occurs on or before February 28, 2018, the Company will pay such bonuses
immediately prior to Closing. Such bonuses for each applicable employee shall
be paid consistent with the terms set forth in _Section 8.2-F_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other subsidiary of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved,
to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any
subsidiary of any of them and the Continuing Employee or any severance,
benefit or other applicable plan or program of Parent covering such Continuing
Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan, or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former service
provider of the Company or its subsidiaries (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

(h) Except to the extent expressly set forth in _Sections 8.2(d)_ and  _(e)_
, nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish any compensation policy, or to amend or modify any existing benefit
plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement established, sponsored
or maintained by Parent or a subsidiary, or (ii) shall alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement at any time.

 

(i) Except to the extent expressly set forth in _Section 8.2(d)_, this
_Section 8.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 8.2_, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

 _GENERAL_

9.1  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will each pay its own fees, costs and
expenses in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including legal fees and
disbursements, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



60 9.2 _Access to Properties, Books and Records_. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the time this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 6_ , the Company will, and will cause
each of its subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, give Representatives of
Parent and Merger Sub (at Parents sole cost and expense), or of any
potential sources of financing to Parent or Merger Sub for financing to be
used in connection with the Merger or after the Merger, reasonable access
during normal business hours to all of their respective properties, books and
records and to personnel who are knowledgeable about the various aspects of
the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company will not be required by this  _Section 9.2_ to, or be
required to cause any of its subsidiaries to, permit any inspection, provide
any access, or disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would be reasonably likely to (a) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, (b) violate any applicable laws (and the Company shall be
permitted to implement customary "clean-room" or other similar arrangements
if the Company reasonably determines, upon advice of outside counsel, that
such arrangements are necessary to comply with applicable law), (c)
unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, (d) breach any agreement of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with any third party, or (e) otherwise result in the disclosure
of trade secrets of a third party or violate its or its subsidiaries
respective obligations to a third party with respect to confidentiality,
_provided_ that the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent of the third parties to the inspection or disclosure. Until the
Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub each will, and will cause its
Representatives to, hold all information it receives as a result of its access
to the properties, books, records and personnel of the Company or its
subsidiaries in confidence on the terms provided in the confidentiality
agreement dated as of October 2, 2017, between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and until the Effective Time, the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to that information to the same extent
it applies to information provided by the Company before this Agreement was
executed. If this Agreement is terminated before the Effective Time, Parent
and Merger Sub will have the same obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement with regard to handling and disposition of confidential information
received after the date of this Agreement that they have with regard to
confidential information received before the date of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

9.3 _Publicity and Notification_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent will each agree on the press release announcing the
signing of this Agreement. Thereafter, but only unless and until (i) with
respect to the Company, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (ii) with respect to Parent, the Parent Board
effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and Parent will
consult with each other before (x) issuing any press releases or otherwise
making any public statements or announcements with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (y)
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Authority
with respect thereto, provided that nothing in this _Section 9.3(a)_ will
prevent any party or any affiliate of any party (A) from making any statement
or announcement when and as required by applicable law or by the rules of any
securities exchange (including the NYSE) or securities quotation or trading
system on which securities of that party or an affiliate are 

 



61  listed, quoted or traded, or (B) from making any press release or public
statement without such consultation that is consistent with any press release
or public statement as to which the parties previously agreed.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly notify the other after
receiving or becoming aware of any notice or other communication from any
person alleging that the consent of such person (or another person) is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto
(which are incorporated herein by this reference), the documents to be
delivered in accordance with this Agreement, including the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement
(collectively, the "Transaction Documents"), contain the entire
agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub relating to the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement, and all other documents,
all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements (oral and written)
between the Company and either Parent or Merger Sub with respect to those
matters are superseded by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
and each party acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied upon any
statements, representations, warranties, understandings or agreements
concerning or relating to the other party, or to the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

 

9.5 _Benefit of Agreement_.

 

(a) This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to it, their
respective successors and any permitted assigns. Each party hereto agrees
that (a) the parties respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto, except, if the Merger takes place (i) as provided in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2(d),_ and (ii) the rights of stockholders of the
Company and holders of options, warrants (if any), restricted stock units and
stock appreciation rights to receive the Merger Consideration or
other consideration or payments pursuant to _Article 1_ , each of which
persons is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement to the
extent, but only to the extent, of the express rights granted to each such
person in this Agreement. Except as set forth in this subsection (a), this
Agreement is not intended to be for the benefit of, or to give any rights to,
any person other than the parties hereto.

 

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters rather than assurances of existence of facts or conditions.
Consequently, no persons other than the parties to this Agreement may rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date or for any other purpose.

9.6 _Effect of Disclosures_. Any information disclosed by a party in
connection with any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
(including any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement) will be treated as
having been disclosed in connection with each

 



62  representation and warranty made by that party in this Agreement. The
parties are aware that a party may include in Sections of its Disclosure
Letter items as to which it is not certain whether they are required to be
included in those Sections of the Disclosure Letter. The fact that an item is
included in a Section of a Disclosure Letter that requires disclosures of
items above a specified level of materiality does not constitute
an acknowledgment that the item is above that level of materiality, and the
fact that an item is included in a Section of a Disclosure Letter that
requires disclosures of violations of particular types of legal or
governmental requirements does not constitute an acknowledgment that the item
in fact violates the applicable legal or governmental requirements.

9.7 _Captions and Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a section, article, exhibit or schedule such reference shall be to a
section, article, exhibit or schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and the captions and headings of the
Articles and Sections of this Agreement or in any exhibit or schedule are for
convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such exhibit or schedule. All
words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number
as the circumstances require. Any capitalized terms used in any exhibit or
schedule but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined
in this Agreement. The word "including" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement will mean "including, without limitation," unless otherwise
specified. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall, unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision in this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "shall"
shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "will."
References to days mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.

9.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will be governed by, and construed under, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of laws
principles that would apply the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

9.12 _Exclusive Jurisdiction; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Company, Parent
and Merger Sub each irrevocably agrees that any proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions that are contemplated by this
Agreement shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then
any such proceeding shall be brought in any other state court or any Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom.
Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement except in such courts in
the State of Delaware, other than proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
Delaware court, (ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of each of
such courts in any such proceeding, (iii) agrees not to seek, and to waive as
a defense in any such proceeding, the transfer of any such proceeding to any
other court, whether because of inconvenience of the forum or for any other
reason, and (iv) agrees that process in any such proceeding may be served by
registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules of the court in
which the proceeding is brought.

9.13 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge that money
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy if the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and accordingly
they agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which a party may be
entitled at law or in equity, any party will be entitled to obtain an order
granting an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
compelling specific performance of another partys obligations under this
Agreement, without proof of actual damages and without any requirement that it
post a bond, and the parties agree that if any proceeding is brought in equity
to compel performance of any provision of this Agreement, no party will raise
the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, no remedy will be exclusive of any other remedy to
which a party may be entitled, and the remedies available to a party will
be cumulative.

9.14 _Attorney Conflicts and Attorney Client Privilege_. Parent, the Company
and Merger Sub each agrees that, although Gibson Dunn and Crutcher LLP ("Gibson
Dunn") has rendered, and may continue to render, legal services to the Company
prior to the Effective Time, including legal services relating to this
Agreement and the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, Gibson
Dunn will have the right, after the Effective Time, to render legal services
to any stockholder, director or employee of the Company, including with regard
to any disputes

 



67  relating to this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, and Parent, the Company and Merger Sub each waives any right it
might have to seek to disqualify Gibson Dunn from rendering legal services to
any stockholder, director or employee of the Company on the basis of any
conflict of interest, because of information of which Gibson Dunn may have
become aware while rendering legal services to the Company, or for any other
reason.

9.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY WAY OF COUNTERCLAIM AND ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS AWARE THAT THIS WAIVER
OF RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL WAS A FACTOR IN THE OTHER PARTYS OR
PARTIES DECISION TO AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT NO PERSON
PROMISED THAT THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WOULD NOT BE ENFORCED.

 

9.16 _Amendments_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended, modified or supplemented, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, by an instrument signed by the Company and Parent. This Agreement may
not be amended or modified after the Effective Time.

 

9.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which may be signed by fewer than all the parties or
may contain facsimile copies of pages signed by some of the parties. This
Agreement shall become effective when at least one counterpart has been signed
by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Each of those
counterparts will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement, but all
of them together will constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic transmission, including by .PDF e-mail attachment, shall be
as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

9.18 _Tax Matters_. The parties to this Agreement intend that (i) the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, (ii) each of Parent and the Company will be a "party to
a reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated under it, and (iii) this Agreement will
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). Each party will do all things that
are commercially reasonable to cause the Merger to qualify for that treatment,
and will fulfill its obligations under the applicable one of _Section 4.1(q)_
and  _Section 4.2(f)_. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties will in
all Tax Returns report the Merger in a manner consistent with the intention
described in the first sentence and no party will take a position inconsistent
with that treatment (whether in audits, in court proceedings or otherwise),
unless required to do otherwise as a result of a final "determination" as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or pursuant to any similar provision
of applicable law).

 



68 9.19 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_ The representations and
warranties in this Agreement will terminate at the Effective Time, and after
the Effective Time, nobody will be able to bring a claim based on any
inaccuracy in, or anything else regarding, any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement.

 

9.20 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid,
void or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a result
of future legislative action, so long as the economic and legal substance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party or its stockholders, such holding or action
shall be strictly construed and shall not affect the validity or effect of any
other provision hereof, as long as the remaining provisions, taken together,
are sufficient to carry out the overall intentions of the parties as
evidenced hereby. The parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to
replace any such invalid, void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, void or
unenforceable provision.

9.21 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its
respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Parent
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete performance
by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its respective
obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable to the same extent as
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a guarantee of performance and
not of collectability. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, protest, notice and all
demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations set
forth in this _Section 9.21_.

 

9.22 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant
hereto, or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or covenants of the other parties contained herein; provided, that
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained or the Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, as the case may be, no waiver may be
made that pursuant to applicable law or stock exchange rules requires further
approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of
Parent, as the case may be, without such further approval or adoption. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed and delivered on behalf of such party. No
failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial waiver of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, or any similar course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
