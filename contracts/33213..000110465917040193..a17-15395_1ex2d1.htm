WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), at a
meeting duly called and held by unanimous vote, (a) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger of

accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law) waived in accordance with this Agreement on the Closing Date)
at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz in New York, New York, or
such other place as Parent and the Company may agree in writing. For purposes
of this Agreement " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date on which the Closing

certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be filed with
the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
time as shall be agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,

of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,

elected or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation.

Amendment prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary actions
to cause the Parent Charter Amendment to become effective at or immediately
following the Effective Time, and Parents restated articles of incorporation,
as amended by the Parent Charter Amendment, shall be the articles of
incorporation of Parent until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Subject to the approval by Parents shareholders of the Parent Charter

bylaws shall provide that the size of the Parent Board shall be no more than
thirteen (13) members.

substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _LLC Sub Merger
Agreement_ "). At the time of and immediately after the LLC Sub Merger, EQT

own all of the membership interests and other equity, if any, in LLC Sub and
shall be the sole member of LLC Sub, and LLC Sub shall be treated as an entity
disregarded as separate from EPC for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** 
**EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB;
EXCHANGE**

 



 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares and any Appraisal
Shares), including for the avoidance of doubt any shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time whose prior
restrictions have lapsed pursuant to _Section 3.2_ or that were issued in
connection with the Redemption pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, shall be
converted into the right to receive from Parent: (A) that number of validly
issued, fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the " _Share Consideration_ ") and (B) $5.30 in cash,
without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ", and together with the Share
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.37.

 



 

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_, shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each
holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock
described in _Section 3.1(b)(iii)_) shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B)
any dividends or other distributions in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_,
in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with
_Section 3.3_.

 



 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by Parent, EIH or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than EIH or Merger Sub) or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Converted Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted into such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by
the Closing Parent Common Stock Price and (B) the Share Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ Without limiting the parties respective
obligations under _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, in the event of any
change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common
Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued
and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date
of such event, be used to calculate the Merger Consideration, subject to
further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_.

 



 

3.2 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards; Common Units_.

 



 

(a) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, any outstanding award of
restricted stock units of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU Award_
") granted pursuant to the Companys 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended
from time to time (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ") shall be assumed by Parent
and shall be converted into an award of restricted stock units of Parent
Common Stock (each, a " _Parent RSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 3.2(a)_, each Company RSU Award assumed and
converted into a Parent RSU Award pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to vesting) as applied to the corresponding Company
RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Performance Stock Units_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, any outstanding award of
performance

 



      
 

 



 

stock units of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company PSU Award_ ") granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan shall be assumed by Parent and shall be
converted into a Parent RSU Award with respect to a number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 3.2(b)_, each Company PSU Award assumed and converted into a
Parent RSU Award pursuant to this _Section 3.2(b)_ shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including with respect
to vesting) as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that any performance
conditions applicable to such converted Company PSU Awards in respect of
performance periods that are incomplete as of the Effective Time shall be
fixed at the Effective Time based on the maximum performance level specified
in the applicable Company PSU Award and such Company PSU Awards thereafter
shall be subject only to continued service-based vesting.

 



 

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and
adopt such resolutions as are required to effectuate the treatment of the
Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 3.2_, and to take all actions reasonably required to effectuate any
provision of this _Section 3.2_ (including with respect to _Schedule 6.9_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter).

 



 

(d) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Parent; Parent Actions_. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume all obligations in respect of the Company Stock
Plan, including the Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards. Parent shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of
authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
settlement of the Parent RSU Awards in accordance with this _Section 3.2_. If
registration of any plan interests in the Company Stock Plan or the shares of
Company Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act,
on the Closing Date or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such awards.

 



 

(e) _Common Units of the Operating Company_. The Company shall, within five
(5) Business Days of the date hereof, provide written notice of an expected
Manager Change of Control (as defined in the Operating Company LLC Agreement)
to all members of the Operating Company other than the Company in accordance
with Section 11.01(g) of the Operating Company LLC Agreement. The Company
shall exercise its right pursuant to Section 11.01(g) of the Operating Company
LLC Agreement to cause any Person other than the Company (a " _Non-Company
Operating Company Member_ ") to effect a redemption of any and all Common
Units (as defined in the Operating Company LLC Agreement) (along with 1/1000th
of a share of Company Class A Preferred Stock in respect of each such Common
Unit) outstanding held by each such Person as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time in exchange for an equal number of shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Redemption_ "). Such shares of Company Common Stock issued in
the Redemption shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock for purposes of _Section 3.1(b)_. All Common Units and shares of
Company Class A Preferred Stock (or fractions thereof) subject to the
Redemption shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed transferred to the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and such Non-Company Operating Company Member shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Units and shares of Company Class A
Preferred Stock (or fractions thereof) (other than the right to receive shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to such Redemption and the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)(i)_).

 



 

(f) _Series B Units of Midstream Holdings_. Unless Midstream Holdings has
received a valid Change in Control Put Notice (as defined in the Midstream
Holdings LLC Agreement) with respect to all issued and outstanding Series B
Units within five (5) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, then
the Company shall, unless Parent otherwise requests in writing, cause
Midstream Holdings to (i) issue a Change in Control Call Notice (as defined in
the Midstream Holdings LLC Agreement) pursuant to and in compliance with
Section 7.2(c) of the Midstream Holdings LLC Agreement to each Person that
holds Series B Units and that did not deliver a valid Change in Control Put
Notice with respect to all Series B Units held by such Person, and (ii)
acquire all remaining Series B Units on the Closing Date pursuant to such
Change in Control Call Notice and in compliance with Section 7.2(g) of the
Midstream Holdings LLC Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. No later than substantially concurrently
with the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the
Companys transfer agent, or another firm reasonably acceptable to the
Company, to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger
Consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares,
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ to which such holders shall become entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_. No later than substantially concurrently with
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for issuance in accordance with this _Article III_ through the
Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
holders of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_ and _Sections 3.3(g)_ and _3.3(h)_ ,
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares
of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment
for fractional shares in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends
or other distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter
be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or
other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of (A) shares represented by a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which
shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
3.1(b)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by
such holder) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to
the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of
such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a condition of payment that
shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_) paid upon the surrender of and in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other
than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock described in _Section 3.1(b)(iii)_), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, without
any interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the three
hundred and sixty fifth (365th) day after the Closing Date shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_,
in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for such amounts.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _Section
3.1(b)(iii)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_.

 



 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be
entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_.
Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall
be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but with a subsequent payment date with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip or
shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a shareholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average
price of Parent Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately
prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares delivered by such holder), the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders
of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

3.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)_, but instead at
the Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and at
the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal
Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and
cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each
such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the use of the
Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the

Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances, (b) each agreement under which
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is the landlord, sublandlord,

enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject,
as to enforceability, to Creditors Rights, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto,
has received written notice of any default under any Company Material Real
Property Lease, and (c) there does not exist any pending or, to the knowledge

qualifications, reservations and encumbrances contained in any Company SEC

Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has

in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way,
except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Systems operated by the
Company and its Subsidiaries are subject to Rights-of-Way, and there are no
gaps (including any gap arising as a result of any breach by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-
Way other than gaps that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.17 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise

report prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (the " _Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the Company interests referred
to therein as of December 31, 2016 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ ") or (ii)

attributable to interests owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, free and
clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of
the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that the Companys
or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or
owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them) (1) entitles the
Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after
satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the
net revenue interest share shown in the Company Reserve Report of all
Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of
such Oil and Gas Properties, (2) obligates the Company (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses
for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil
and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the
Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any
positive differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest
shown on the Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are
accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

 



 

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have

the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of the
Company set forth in the Company Reserve Report are derived from reports that
have been prepared by the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such
reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of
the Company at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC
guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change
in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases that are a part of the
Company Oil and Gas Properties (" _Company Oil and Gas Leases_ ") have been
properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Company Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been
timely and properly paid, (iii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(and, to the Companys knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any
provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any
Company Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or
terminate such Company Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Company Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Company Oil
and Gas Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely
manner and no material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
any such Company Oil and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any
other Person or individual) for any reason except as reported in the Company
SEC Documents.

Company, which Releases are reasonably likely to result in material liability
to the Company under Environmental Law, and, as of the date of this Agreement,

off-site location where Hazardous Substances from the Companys operations

otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and

disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (excluding any disclosures set forth in
any such Parent SEC Documents in any risk factor section, any forward-looking
disclosure or any other statements that are non-specific, predictive or

obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability to

the avoidance of doubt (i) any contract or arrangement solely among Parent
and/or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any customary Tax sharing or

right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the
businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted

own or have the right to use such properties would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
To the knowledge of Parent, the use of the Parent Intellectual Property by
Parent and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of each of Parent
and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted does not infringe upon or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such
matters that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets used

conducted, except where failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.15 _Real Property_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,

defensible title to all material real property owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Owned Real Property_ ") and valid

Property_ ") free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted
Encumbrances, (b) each agreement under which Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with

and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors
Rights, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, has received written notice of any default
under any Parent Material Real Property Lease, and (c) as of the date of this
Agreement, there does not exist any pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, condemnation or eminent domain proceedings that affect any of
Parents Oil and Gas Properties, Parent Owned Real Property or Parent Material
Leased Real Property.

 



 

5.16 _Rights-of-Way_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has such Rights-of-
Way as are sufficient to conduct its business in the manner described, and
subject to the limitations, qualifications, reservations and encumbrances
contained in any Parent SEC Document, except for such Rights-of-Way the
absence of which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all its material
obligations with respect to such

 



      
 

 



 

Rights-of-Way and conduct their business in a manner that does not violate any
of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows, or after notice or
lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or would result
in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way,
except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All pipelines operated by Parent
and its Subsidiaries are subject to Rights-of-Way, and there are no gaps
(including any gap arising as a result of any breach by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way other
than gaps that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.17 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the dates of the reserve
report prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (the " _Parent Independent
Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the Parent interests referred to therein
as of December 31, 2016 (the " _Parent Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in
the Parent Reserve Report or in the Parent SEC Documents as having been sold
or otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear
of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that Parents or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them
(or purported to be held or owned by them) (1) entitles Parent (or one or more
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest
share shown in the Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from
such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas
Properties, (2) obligates Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance
and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties,
of not greater than the working interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report
for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive differences in such
percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on the Parent Reserve
Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate
(or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (3) is
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

 



 

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Parent to the Parent
Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Parent interests referred to
in the Parent Reserve Report, by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries
that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the
time provided, accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of Parent set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been
prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve
estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent
at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines
applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)
and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the
matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases have been properly
and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties
and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned
or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly
paid, (iii) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the Parents
knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or
failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or
entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease)
included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.18 _Environmental Matters_. Except for those matters that have not had and

Parent Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations and assets are

(b) as of the date of this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries are not
subject to any pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened Proceedings under

otherwise used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, by any predecessors of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, which
Releases are reasonably likely to result in material liability to Parent under
Environmental Law, and, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice asserting a liability
or obligation under any Environmental Laws with respect to the investigation,
remediation, removal, or monitoring of the Release of any Hazardous Substances
at or from any property currently or formerly owned, operated, or otherwise
used by Parent, or at or from any off-site location where Hazardous Substances
from Parents operations have been sent for treatment, disposal storage or
handling; and.

 



 

(d) there have been no environmental investigations, studies, audits, or other
analyses conducted during the past three (3) years by or on behalf of, or that

to any property owned, operated or otherwise used by any of them that have not
been delivered or otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 



 

5.19 _Material Contracts_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) to which or by which Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent is a party or is otherwise bound (" _Parent Contracts_ ")
is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms on
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors Rights. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach or default under any Parent Contract nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
is any other party to any such Parent Contract in breach or default
thereunder.

 



 

5.20 _Insurance_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have obtained and maintained in
full force and effect insurance, underwritten by financially reputable
insurance companies, in such amounts, on such terms and covering such risks as
is reasonably adequate and customary for their business and operations.
_Schedule 5.20_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of all insurance policies maintained by Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries for the last three (3) years. Parent or the applicable Subsidiary
of the Company has paid, or caused to be paid, all premiums due under such
policies and is not in default with respect to any obligations under such
policies in any material respect, including, but not limited to, reporting of
claims or incidents that may give rise to a claim. All such policies are
valid, outstanding and enforceable and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has agreed to modify or cancel any of such insurance policies nor
has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries received any notice of any actual or
threatened modification, non-renewal or cancellation of such insurance other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or such
as is normal and customary in Parents industry. As of the date hereof, none
of the limits for any such policy currently in force have been exhausted or
materially reduced.

 



 

5.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Parent Board has received the opinion
of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. addressed to the Parent Board to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth therein,
the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.

 



 

5.22 _Brokers_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to Citigroup Global

brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

 



 

5.23 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries own or have, within the last three (3) years, owned any shares of

its inception, Merger Sub has not engaged in any activity, other than such
actions in connection with (a) its organization and (b) the preparation,

5.26 _Corporate Governance_.

 



 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and EQT MLP, as
applicable, has disclosed to Parents or EQT MLPs auditors and audit
committee (A) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents or EQT
MLPs ability to record, process, summarize and report its consolidated
financial information and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
or EQT MLPs internal controls over financial reporting. Since January 1,
2015, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or permitted to
remain outstanding any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section
402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any executive officer of
Parent or EQT MLP (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director
of Parent, EQT MLP or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Parent and EQT MLP have established and maintain "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). To the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
and EQT MLP, including their respective Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by Parent and EQT MLP, including their respective Subsidiaries, in the reports
that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to Parents and EQT MLPs respective principal executive officers
and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent and EQT MLP in the
reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms.

 



 

5.27 _No Additional Representations_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made in this _Article V_,
neither Parent nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities or conditions
(financial or otherwise) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties. In

 



      
 

 



 

particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither Parent nor any

reliance upon, any representations, warranties or statements relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given by the Company in _Article IV_, including any implied
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent, or
any of its Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect
information that may have been made available to Parent or any of its
Representatives (including in certain "data rooms," "virtual data rooms,"

inconsistent with the Company Boards duties under applicable Law, (B) the

good faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect a Company Change of Recommendation and that the failure to
make a Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards duties under applicable Law.

Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of the Companys request to do
so, or (v) fail to announce publicly within ten (10) Business Days after a
tender or exchange offer relating to any Parent Common Stock shall have been
commenced that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer and reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation (the taking of
any action described in this _Section 6.4(c)_ being referred to as a "
_Parent Change of Recommendation_ "). Parent shall not fail to include the
Parent Charter Amendment Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, or
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, the Parent Charter Amendment Recommendation.

 



 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall advise the Company
of the receipt by Parent of any Parent Competing Proposal made on or after the
date of this Agreement or any request for non-public information or data
relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries made by any Person in connection
with a Parent Competing Proposal or any request for discussions or
negotiations with Parent or a Representative of Parent relating to a Parent
Competing Proposal (in each case within 48 hours thereof), and Parent shall
provide to the Company (within such 48 hour time frame) either (i) a copy of
any such Parent Competing Proposal made in writing provided to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such
Parent Competing Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such
Parent Competing Proposal). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed
with respect to the status and material terms of any such Parent Competing
Proposal and any material changes to the status of any such discussions or
negotiations, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
transmittal or receipt), provide the Company with copies of any material
correspondence and, with respect to material oral communications, a written
summary of such correspondence or communications, between: (x) on the one
hand, Parent or any of their Representatives; and (y) on the other hand, the
Person that made or submitted such Parent Competing Proposal or any
Representative of such Person.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, may:

 



 

(i) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of Parent, the Parent Board or any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.4(e)(iii)_ or _Section
6.4(f)_, effect a Parent Change of Recommendation including in any disclosure
document or communication filed or publicly issued or made in conjunction with
the compliance with such requirements;

 



 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, engage in the
activities prohibited by _Sections 6.4(b)(i)_ , _6.4(b)(ii)_ or _6.4(b)(iii)_
, solely with and to any Person who has made a written, _bona fide_ Parent
Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no non-public information that is prohibited
from being furnished pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ may be furnished until
Parent receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent that are no less favorable
to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided, further,_ that such confidentiality agreement does not contain
provisions that prohibit Parent from

 



       
 

 



 

complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.4_, and (B) prior to taking
any such actions, the Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Parent Competing Proposal is, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal and, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in such activities would
be inconsistent with the Parent Boards duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, in response to
a Parent Competing Proposal that is conditioned upon the termination of this
Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated (including
through the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article VII) and
that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_, if the Parent Board
(or any committee thereof) so chooses, cause Parent to effect a Parent Change
of Recommendation, if prior to taking such action (A) the Parent Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Parent Competing
Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to
the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by the Company in response to
such Parent Competing Proposal), (B) the Parent Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards duties under applicable Law,
and (C) Parent shall have given notice to the Company that Parent has received
such proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal,
and, that Parent intends to take such action, and either (1) the Company shall
not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent
Shareholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such
notice is given to the Company, or (2) if the Company within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Parent Competing
Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal with respect to the Companys
revised proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that each time material
modifications to the financial terms of a Parent Competing Proposal determined
to be a Parent Superior Proposal are made the time period set forth in this
_clause (C)_ prior to which Parent may effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for 48 hours
after notification of such change to the Company; and

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement,
Parent may, if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) so chooses, effect
a Parent Change of Recommendation if prior to taking such action (A) the
Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards its fiduciary duties to
Parents shareholders under applicable Law, (B) Parent shall have given notice
to the Company that Parent has determined that a Parent Intervening Event has
occurred or arisen (which notice will reasonably describe such Parent
Intervening Event) and that Parent intends to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation, and either (1) the Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent
Shareholders Meeting and the fourth Business Day after the date on which such
notice is given to the Company, or (2) if the Company within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with its outside legal counsel, shall have
determined in good faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the need
for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation and that the
failure to make a Parent Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the Parent Boards duties to Parents shareholders under applicable Law.

 



 

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 



 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of its
capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the adoption
by its stockholders of this Agreement. The Company will promptly furnish to
Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the
holders of its capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose
of including such data and information in the Registration Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable
Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders
of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the holders of
Parent Common Stock at the Parent Shareholders Meeting, and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (of which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon
after such filing as practicable and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other
promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each
of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) provide the
other with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the
other and (iii) not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each
party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and
Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 



 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company
and the shareholders of Parent.

 



 

6.6 _Stockholder and Shareholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of,

necessary to conduct business at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii)
may, and at Parents request shall, adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders

represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date

the Merger and the Parent Board shall solicit from shareholders of Parent
proxies in favor of such issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and
the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Parent Board has made the Parent Board Recommendation. The Parent Board shall
recommend that the shareholders of Parent vote in favor of the Parent Charter
Amendment and the Parent Board shall solicit from shareholders of Parent
proxies in favor of the Parent Charter Amendment, and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Parent Board has
made the Parent Charter Amendment Recommendation. Parents obligations to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting in

Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed

6.7 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the other party and its Representatives, during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the terms of _Section 8.1_ of this Agreement, reasonable access, at
reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its
Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
the other party and its Representatives such information concerning its and
its Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as
may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the other
party. Each party and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the other party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the
other party and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.7(a)_, neither party shall be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to the other party or any of its Representatives to the extent
that such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such
information is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall have access to
personnel records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in the other partys good faith opinion the disclosure of
which could subject the other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of
liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be permitted to
conduct any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or building
materials at any facility of the other party or its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the other party, which may be granted or withheld in
such other partys sole discretion. Each party agrees that it will not, and
will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant
to this _Section 6.7(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of April 24, 2017 between Parent
and the Company (as amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All
information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Preliminary
Discussions" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws
to which _Sections 6.8(b)_ and _(e)_ , and not this _Section 6.8(a)_, shall
apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall
proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities all
authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations,
declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall
cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, the parties shall make any filings required under the
HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other
and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless
otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity charged with
enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating the HSR Act or any other
Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or
effect of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a dominant
position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, any
attorney general of any state of the United States, or any other competition
authority of any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ ").

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 6.8(b)_, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii)
promptly notify the other Party of any communication concerning this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any
Governmental Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the consent of
such person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep
the other Party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other
Party with any written notices or other communications received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except that any materials concerning one Partys valuation of the other Party
may be redacted; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in draft any
proposed communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental Entity with
reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with each other in
advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a

 



      
 

 



 

private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the
applicable Governmental Entity or Person, not agree to participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings or
investigations concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party and its
Representatives in advance and invites the other Partys Representatives to
attend in accordance with applicable Laws. Parent shall be entitled to direct
any Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any
of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. The parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Laws, including any
Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, in order to resolve any
objections, the Company is asked to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom with
respect to its or its Subsidiaries ability to retain any of the businesses,
product lines, or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, such actions
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company and each of their respective
Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed).

 



 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of
the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law.

 



 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall cause each individual who is employed as of the
Closing Date by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ")
and who remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to be
provided with, for the portion of the Continuation Period during which such
Company Employee is employed, (i) base compensation (salary or wages, as
applicable), and as applicable, an annual bonus opportunity that are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (provided that, with respect to each applicable Company
Employees annual bonus for 2017, the benefits contemplated by Item 1 of
_Schedule 6.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to satisfy the
incentive compensation opportunity requirements of this _clause (i)_ ) and
(ii) employee benefits (other than severance) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those that are provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, for purposes of this
_clause (ii)_ , the employee benefits (other than severance) generally
provided to employees of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall
be deemed to be substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, it being
understood that so long as all Company Employees are continuously provided
with the employee benefits required by this _clause (ii)_ , the Company
Employees may commence participation in the "employee benefit plans," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") at
such times as are determined by Parent.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Company Employees
shall be given credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and,
with respect to severance, vacation or paid-time off benefits, for purposes of
benefit accrual, in each case, in any New Plan (other than (x) for any
purpose, with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA or plan that provides retiree medical benefits or disability
benefits, or (y) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits)
in which the Company Employees participate, for such Company Employees
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent and for the
same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding
Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, to comply with _Schedule 6.9_.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage
of any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements and
requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and
welfare New Plan to the extent (x) such Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents are covered under a Company Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date that provides corresponding benefits and (y) such conditions,
periods or requirements are satisfied by, or waived for, such Company Employee
and his or her eligible dependents under such Company Plan (ii) give each
Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for
any payments made towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which
payment has been made to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Company Plan prior to the date that the Company Employee first
participates in the New Plan, in each case, to the extent permitted by the
applicable insurance plan provider.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement of the Company Disclosure
Letter, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor their
respective obligations to individuals employed prior to the Closing Date by
the Company or a Subsidiary thereof under all employment, severance, change in
control and other agreements or plans, if any, entered into or sponsored by
the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof).

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent not less than 10 Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is
necessary to terminate the Company Plans that are Tax-qualified defined
contribution plans (collectively, the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Company Qualified DC Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing
Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken
in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the review
and approval of Parent. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts
under the Company Qualified DC Plan to the participants, Parent shall permit
such participants who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash or (in the
case of loans) notes, from the Company Qualified DC Plan to the applicable
Tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review, comment on and approve
all written or broad-based oral communications to employees and other
individual service providers of the Company and its Subsidiaries related to
the transactions contemplated hereby, including in regard to employment or
compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or to be provided
following the Closing.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement generally, or this _Section 6.9_ specifically,
shall be deemed or construed to (i) constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
(ii) limit Parents or its Subsidiaries right to amend any Employee Benefit

6.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on
the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time and until the six (6)
year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability

 



      
 

 



 

company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise (the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and
expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of
or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which
such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any
of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee
Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not
done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or
omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any
Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Persons may retain the Companys regularly engaged legal
counsel or other counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Persons, and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor
are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use its best
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person
wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
_Section 6.10(a)_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party
from any obligations that it may have under this _Section 6.10(a)_ except to
the extent such failure materially prejudices such partys position with
respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of whether any
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 6.10(a)_, such Indemnified Person shall have
the right to require that such determination be made by special, independent
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services
for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last
three (3) years.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner
that would) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any
Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any
indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or
employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
_Section 6.10_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons
rights under this _Section 6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract
regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies with a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from the Effective
Time placed with insurance companies having the same or better AM Best
Financial rating as the Companys and Rice MLPs current directors and
officers liability insurance companies with terms and conditions providing
retentions, limits and other material terms no less favorable than the current
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company and Rice MLP with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may elect in its sole discretion to, but shall not be required to,
spend more than 300% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid by
the Company and Rice MLP prior to the date hereof for the six (6) years of
coverage under such "tail" policy; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost
of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects not to spend more
than the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Parent shall purchase as much
coverage as is reasonably available for the Cap Amount.

 



 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in _Section 6.10(a)_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets or the
assets of any Subsidiary in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
render Parent or Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations
under _Section 6.10(a)_. The provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each
Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense
advancement pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_, and his heirs and representatives.

 



 

6.11 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on
all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
any such Proceeding, and no settlement shall be agreed to or offered without
Parents prior written consent.

 



      
 

 



 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the parties. The parties will not, and each of the foregoing
will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make
other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the parties unless
such statements are substantially identical to public statements previously
approved by each party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party, its
Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or other
public disclosures required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which such partys or its Subsidiarys capital stock is traded;
_provided_ that such party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other
party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comment regarding same; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither party shall be (i) restricted from making internal communications with
its employees which are not made public or (ii) required by any provision of
this Agreement to consult with or obtain any approval from any other party
with respect to a public announcement or press release issued in connection
with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or Parent
Competing Proposal, as applicable, and matters related thereto or a Company

event having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be. Except with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided
in _Section 6.8_, the Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other
(or their respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such party or its
Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions. Without limiting in any way any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the other party and their respective Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) all

be borne and paid by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries when due, and Parent shall file or cause to be filed all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation required to be filed by Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes, and (ii) Parent shall reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless against liability for any such Transfer Taxes any holder of Company
Common Stock. The parties will cooperate, in good faith, in the filing of any
such Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and the minimization, to
the extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law, of the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this

conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

been approved by Parents shareholders prior to the Effective Time, (x) Parent
and the Parent Board shall only be required to appoint to the Parent Board
immediately following the Effective Time and nominate in the proxy statement

appointment shall be effected as soon as reasonably practicable following
approval by Parents shareholders of the Post-Closing Charter Amendment
Proposal; _provided_ that all obligations of Parent and the Parent Board
pursuant to this _clause (y)_ shall terminate in the event that Parents
shareholders fail to approve the Post-Closing Charter Amendment at the Post-
Closing Annual Meeting.

breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of intentional
fraud or a willful and material breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation (in which case only Parent shall be liable for damages for such
intentional fraud or willful and material breach), and upon payment of such
amount, none of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
except for the liability of Parent in the case of intentional fraud or a
willful and material breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation; and (ii)

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against
any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or
warranties to the extent that

 



      
 

 



 

the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure, notwithstanding the presence or
absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or warranties or
an appropriate cross reference thereto.

 



 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise.
Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or
other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not
constitute any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained
therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this
Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the
Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including"
(in its various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)

8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an

performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section 9.10_, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of
this Agreement at law or in equity. Each party accordingly agrees not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.10_. Each
party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with

and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If
prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings an action to enforce

party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such other time period

modified without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, to the extent legally allowed:

 



 

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party hereunder;

 



 

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 



 

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
