(a) _Closing Estimates_. On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Parent a statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "), setting forth the
Companys good faith estimate of the amounts of the Net Working Capital (the "

_Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment_ "), if any, the Net Funded
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness_ "), the Transaction
Related Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Related Expenses_ ") and the
components and calculations thereof in reasonable detail. The Pre-Closing
Statement and the Companys calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital,
the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction Related
Expenses set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared and
calculated in good faith in the manner and on a basis consistent with the
definitions of Net Working Capital, Net Funded Indebtedness and Transaction
Related Expenses and, in the case of Net Working Capital, the Accounting
Principles. The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide
promptly to Parent reasonable access to the Companys Representatives,
employees, Books and Records, and any other information (in each

 



      
 

 



 

case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law) as Parent shall reasonably
request in connection with its review of the Pre-Closing Statement. Such
access shall be provided during regular business hours solely to the extent
necessary, subject in all respects to the last sentence of this _Section
2.5(a)_, to review, dispute or object to all or any portion of the Pre-Closing
Statement. All information obtained in connection with the foregoing access
shall be governed by the terms of Section Section 5.4 and the Confidentiality
Agreement. If, prior to the Closing, Parent objects in good faith to any of
the estimates provided by the Company in the Pre-Closing Statement, Parent and
the Company shall attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with
respect to any such objections, and, subject in all respects to the last
sentence of this _Section 2.5(a)_, the Company shall revise the Pre-Closing
Statement and amounts set forth therein to reflect any such mutually agreed
resolutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Parent and
the Company do not mutually resolve any such disputes or objections prior to
the Closing, then the estimate that is provided by the Company and included in
the Pre-Closing Statement to which such dispute or objection relates shall be
deemed in all respects to be the estimate of the Company provided in the Pre-
Closing Statement and the parties shall consummate the Closing solely on that
basis.

 



 

(b) _Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount_. The amount payable
by Parent to the Shareholder Representative at the Closing shall be an amount
(the " _Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount_ ") in Dollars
equal to (i) the Base Closing Cash Amount, _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment (which may be a negative number), _minus_ (iii) the
Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness (for the avoidance of doubt, if Estimated
Net Funded Indebtedness is a negative number, the Estimated Closing Date
Merger Consideration Amount will increase), _minus_ (iv) the Estimated
Transaction Related Expenses, _minus_ (v) the Escrow Amount, _minus_ (vi) the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(c) _Parent Payments at the Closing_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay the
following (with wire transfer or other payment instructions for each of the
following to be specified in writing and provided by the Shareholder
Representative to Parent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date):

 



 

(i) an amount equal to [***] Dollars ($[***]) (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), to

established by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "
_Escrow Account_ ");

immediately available funds, to one or more accounts of the holders of the
Closing Debt to be Discharged as specified in writing by the Shareholder
Representative to Parent prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to the Estimated Transaction Related Expenses, to one or
more accounts (of the applicable Persons to whom such payments are required to
be made) as specified in writing by the Shareholder Representative to Parent
prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(iv) the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account specified in writing by the
Shareholder Representative to Parent, which amount shall be held by the

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount
to the Shareholder Representative (for the benefit of and distribution to the
Shareholder in accordance with _Section 2.6_), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts specified in writing by
the Shareholder Representative to Parent.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Mechanism of Payment_.

 



 

(a) The Shareholder Representative shall distribute in cash the Estimated
Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount to the Shareholder at the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 2.4.(a)(i)_.

 



 

(b) Each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause or direct the Company, Surviving
Company or the Escrow Agent to deduct and withhold, from any payment made
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, any amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the
Code or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, notify the Shareholder Representative in writing in advance of
the intention to make such deduction or withholding (or to permit such
deduction or withholding to be made), (ii) Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Company and the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholder)
shall reasonably cooperate with one another to reduce or minimize any such
deduction or withholding (to the extent legally permissible), (iii) each of
the Surviving Company, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to rely
on any Withholding Tax Forms received pursuant to _Section 7.7_ for purposes
of computing the amount of any such deduction or withholding under U.S.
federal Tax Law to the extent permitted by applicable Law and (iv) Parent or
the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall timely remit (or cause to be
remitted) to the appropriate Taxing Authority any amounts so deducted or
withheld (or permitted to be deducted or withheld), timely file (or cause to
be timely filed) all Tax Returns in respect of such deduction or withholding,
and provide to the Shareholder Representative copies of such Tax Returns. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section
2.6(b)_ and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

the components thereof in reasonable detail. The Closing Statement and

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

Principles (in the case of Net Working Capital) and the definitions thereof,
and shall be in the same form and include the same line items as the Estimated
Net Working Capital calculation, the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
calculation, the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness calculation, and the
Estimated Transaction Related Expenses calculation, and shall otherwise (i)
not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) be based on facts
and circumstances as they exist on the Closing Date and (iii) not include any
changes in assets or liabilities as a result of any event occurring on or
after the Closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the Accounting Principles are not intended to
permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies. If the Closing Statement is not so timely delivered, then the
Shareholder Representative shall be permitted, within five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of the foregoing [***]-day period, to prepare and deliver
a written notice to Parent setting forth the itemized amounts, if any,
included in any of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment, the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and the
Estimated Transaction Related Expenses that, after giving effect to the
Closing, the Shareholder Representative disputes (such itemized amounts, the "
_Shareholder Disputed Amounts_ ", and such notice, together with the
calculations contained therein, the " _Shareholder Representative Closing
Notice_ "), together with supporting documentation relating thereto. If the
Shareholder Representative does not deliver such Shareholder Representative
Closing Notice on or prior to such fifth (5th) Business Day, then the
Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment,
the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction Related
Expenses will be deemed Final Net Working Capital, Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Final Net Funded Indebtedness and Final Transaction Related
Expenses, respectively. In the event that the Shareholder Representative
delivers to Parent such Shareholder Representative Closing Notice within such
five (5) Business Day period, Parent will have twenty (20) Business Days to
review the Shareholder Representative Closing Notice. If Parent provides
written notice to the Shareholder Representative setting forth the itemized
amounts, if any, included in the Shareholder Disputed Amounts Parent disputes,
together with supporting documentation relating thereto, within such twenty
(20) Business Day period, then such disputed itemized amounts (but not any
other amounts) shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Section 2.9(b)_ and _Section 2.9(c)_ _ mutatis mutandis _(with
"Shareholder Disputed Amounts" being treated as "Disputed Items" for purposes
thereunder). Unless Parent delivers written notice to the Shareholder
Representative on or prior to the twentieth (20th) Business Day after Parents
receipt of the Shareholder Representative Closing Notice, Parent will be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Shareholder Representative Closing
Notice and such statement (and the calculations contained therein) will be
final, binding and conclusive.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Shareholder Representative
will have twenty (20) Business Days to review the Closing Statement. Unless
the Shareholder Representative delivers written notice (which notice shall
include the items and amounts in dispute and supporting documentation related
thereto (each such item, a " _Disputed Item_ ")) to Parent on or prior to the
twentieth (20th) Business Day after the Shareholder Representatives receipt
of the Closing Statement, the Shareholder Representative will be deemed to
have accepted and agreed to the Closing Statement and such statement (and the
calculations contained therein) will be final, binding and conclusive. If the
Shareholder Representative notifies Parent of Disputed Items within such
twenty (20) Business Day period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall, during the thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such notice
by the Shareholder Representative to Parent (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree in writing)

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

(the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to Disputed Items, and all other items (and all
calculations relating thereto) will be final, binding and conclusive. Any
resolution by Parent and the Shareholder Representative during the Resolution
Period as to any Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing and will be
final, binding and conclusive.

 



 

(c) If Parent and the Shareholder Representative do not resolve all Disputed
Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining
in dispute will be submitted to the Neutral Firm. The Neutral Firm shall act
as an expert and not an arbitrator to determine only those Disputed Items
remaining in dispute, consistent with this _Section Section 2.9.(c)_ and
shall request a statement from Parent and the Shareholder Representative
regarding such Disputed Items. The scope of the disputes to be arbitrated by
the Neutral Firm shall be limited solely to the Disputed Items; and the
Neutral Firm shall not make any other determination, including not making any
determination as to whether any of the Closing Statement or Net Working
Capital, the Net Working Capital Adjustment, Net Funded Indebtedness or
Transaction Related Expenses was prepared in accordance with GAAP or whether
the Target Net Working Capital Amount is correct or appropriate. In resolving
each Disputed Item, the Neutral Firm shall be bound by the principles set
forth in this _Section Section 2.9.(c)_ and may not assign a value to any
Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed
by any party or less than the lowest value for such Disputed Item claimed by
any party. The parties further agree that the adjustment contemplated by this
_Section Section 2.9.(c)_ is intended to show the change between the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital, the change
between the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment and the Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment, the change between the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness
and the Final Net Funded Indebtedness, and the change between the Estimated
Transaction Related Expenses and the Final Transaction Related Expenses, and
that such changes can only be measured if each calculation is done in a manner
consistent with the Accounting Principles (in the case of Net Working Capital)
and the definitions thereof. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Neutral Firm will be allocated between Parent and
the Shareholder Representative in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Firm) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted.
The parties shall instruct the Neutral Firm to deliver to Parent and the
Shareholder Representative a written determination (such determination to
include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations and corresponding
explanations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Firm by the Shareholder Representative and
Parent) of the Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Firm within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of such Disputed Items, which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error. The final, binding and
conclusive Closing Statement based either upon agreement by the parties, or
deemed agreement by Parent and the Shareholder Representative in accordance
with this _Section Section 2.9_, or the written determination delivered by
the Neutral Firm in accordance with this _Section Section 2.9.(c)_ will be
the conclusive Closing Statement for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(d) If any party fails to submit a statement regarding any Disputed Item
submitted to the Neutral Firm within the time determined by the Neutral Firm
or otherwise fails to give the Neutral Firm access as reasonably requested,
then the Neutral Firm shall render a decision based solely on the evidence
timely submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Firm by the other
party.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 2.9(f)(ii)_:

 



 

(i) If the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount is greater than
the Final Merger Consideration Amount, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow
Amount to Parent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the amount by
which the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount exceeds the Final
Merger Consideration Amount; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount is less than
the Final Merger Consideration Amount, Parent shall pay, or cause the
Surviving Company to pay, to the Shareholder Representative (for the benefit
of and further distribution to the Shareholder) an amount in cash equal to the
amount by which the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration Amount is less
than the Final Merger Consideration Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

Any amount payable to any party pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Estimated Closing Date Merger Consideration
Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise, Parent,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges that the sole and
exclusive remedy of itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to receive
payments owed to it under this _Section 2.9_ shall be the recovery available
solely from the funds in the Escrow Account and that the Escrow Amount and
funds in the Escrow Account shall not be available to satisfy any other claim
or obligation hereunder. In the event that the funds in the Escrow Account are
insufficient to pay to the Surviving Company, Merger Sub or Parent any amounts
owed to it pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to collect any remaining amounts not
satisfied from the funds in the Escrow Account, and none of the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholder or any other Person shall have any liability
for any such deficiency. Within one Business Day after payment to either
Parent or the Shareholder Representative, pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)(i)_ or
_Section 2.9(e)(ii)_, respectively, the Escrow Agent will be instructed to
distribute any funds remaining in the Escrow Account as of such date to the
Shareholder Representative (for the benefit of and further distribution to the
Shareholder).

 



 

(f) If, after receipt of the Closing Statement or a Shareholder Representative
Closing Notice, as applicable, pursuant to _Section Section 2.9.(a)_:

 



 

(i) (A) following delivery of a Closing Statement, the Shareholder
Representative does not deliver a notice of dispute as described in _Section
Section 2.9.(b)_ within the twenty (20) Business Day period following the
Shareholder Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement or if within
such period the Shareholder Representative delivers a notice to Parent stating
that the Shareholder Representative does not dispute any item in the Closing
Statement or (B) following delivery of a Shareholder Representative Closing
Notice, Parent does not deliver a notice of dispute as described in _Section
Section 2.9.(a)_ within the twenty (20) Business Day period following Parents
receipt of the Shareholder Representative Closing Notice or if within such
period Parent delivers a notice to the Shareholder Representative stating that
Parent does not dispute any item in the Shareholder Representative Closing
Notice (in either case such notice, a " _Non-Dispute Notice_ "), then on the
second (2nd) Business Day following the earlier of (x) the last day of such
twenty (20) Business Day period (in the case of a Closing Statement) or such
twenty (20) Business Day period (in the case of a Shareholder Representative

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Purchased
Companies: (i) the conduct of the business of each Purchased Company as
currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person and (ii) to the Companys
Knowledge, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
any Company Intellectual Property Rights. There is no Litigation pending or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against any of the Purchased Companies

Knowledge, against any of the Licensed Company Intellectual Property, and as
of the date of this Agreement none of the Purchased Companies has received any
written threat or written claim or complaint in the three (3) year period
prior to the date hereof in each case, (A) alleging that the Products or the
conduct of any Purchased Companys business (including with respect to the
Exploitation of any of the Products, and the use or practice of any of the
Company Intellectual Property Rights in connection therewith) infringe,
misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, (B)
challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the inventorship, ownership,
legality, validity, enforceability, priority, scope, use, right to use, right
to register or registrability of any of the Company Intellectual Property
Rights or (C) challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the right, title or
interest of, or practice or use by, the Purchased Companies or, to the
Companys Knowledge, any of its or their licensors, in, to, under, or of any

sublicense, assign, convey or transfer such any of the Company Intellectual
Property Rights. There is no Litigation pending or threatened in writing by
any Purchased Company against any other Person and, as of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Purchased Companies has threatened or sent any written
notice, claim or complaint to or against any Person in the three (3) year
period prior to the date hereof, alleging that such Person is infringing,
misappropriating or violating any Company Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(d) The Owned Company Intellectual Property and, to Companys Knowledge, the
Licensed Company Intellectual Property, are not subject to any outstanding
Judgment, settlement or other disposition of any dispute that impairs or
restricts in any material respect the Purchased Companies Exploitation of any
Products as currently Exploited, or the Purchased Companies use of, or right
to use, license, sublicense, enforce, assign, convey or transfer, any such
Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(e) Each of the Purchased Companies has taken commercially reasonable measures
to maintain, protect, and preserve the security, confidentiality and ownership
of all trade secrets and material confidential information included in the
Company Intellectual Property Rights (" _Confidential Company Information_ ").
Each of the Purchased Companies has obtained from (i) each of its current and
former employees and consultants, and (ii) all other Persons who have had
access to any material Confidential Company Information or were engaged by any
Purchased Company and, in each of (i) and (ii), are or were

 



      
 

 



 

involved in, or participated in or contributed to, the conception, creation,
development, reduction to practice, improvement to or modification of any of
the Products or any Intellectual Property Rights used or intended for use in
the conduct of the respective businesses of the Purchased Companies, a binding
and enforceable written Contract which includes (i) confidentiality and
restriction on use terms sufficient to maintain the confidential status and
limit the use of such Confidential Company Information and (ii) provisions
sufficient to ensure that such Purchased Company is the exclusive owner of all
such Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or relating to such Persons
activities with respect to such Purchased Companys business.

 



 

(f) Each of the Purchased Companies has taken commercially reasonable steps to
ensure the continued operation of the material software and databases included
in the Company Intellectual Property Rights, and all of its material computers
and other information technology infrastructure and assets used in the
business (collectively, the " _IT Assets_ "), and to protect the security and
confidentiality of its IT Assets and the material information and records
stored on or accessed or transmitted using the IT Assets. The IT Assets of the
Purchased Companies operate and perform in all material respects as is
necessary and sufficient for the conduct of the business of the Purchased
Companies as currently conducted by the Purchased Companies or, to the
Companys Knowledge, Parent. To the Companys Knowledge, the IT Assets are
free from malicious code and do not contain any bugs, errors, vulnerabilities
or problems that, in each case, would be expected to materially adversely
affect the operation or use of any such IT Assets in the business of the
Purchased Companies. There has not been in the past three (3) years any
material (i) unauthorized intrusions or breach of the security of the IT
Assets, (ii) malfunction of the IT Assets or (iii) accidental or unauthorized
access to, loss, or misuse of Personal Data maintained by the Company. The
Purchased Companies have implemented commercially reasonable backups and
security measures to duplicate, store, and protect its material information
that is stored in electronic form or media.

 



 

(g) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event) and the compliance with the provisions of this Agreement do not
and will not result in (i) a loss, alteration, or impairment (in whole or in
part) of, or Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on, any Company Intellectual
Property Rights or any of the Products, (ii) a conflict with, or a loss,
alteration, or impairment (in whole or in part) of any of the rights of the
Purchased Companies in or to any of Company Intellectual Property Rights or
any of the Products, or the validity, enforceability, use, right to use,
registration, right to register, ownership, priority, duration, scope or
effectiveness of any Company Intellectual Property Rights or (iii) the grant,
assignment, or transfer to any Person of any license or other right,
authorization, or interest under, to or in any of the Products or in any of
the Company Intellectual Property Rights, which in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Purchased Companies.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth in the IP Contracts or otherwise on _Schedule 3.10(h)_
, there are no royalty, milestone, license fee, remuneration or other payment
obligations with respect to the Exploitation of the Products or any license of
Intellectual Property Rights to which any Purchased Company is a party.

 



 

Section 3.11. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.11(a)_ sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
material Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Benefit Plan_ "
means each profit-sharing, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted
stock units/shares, stock ownership, stock appreciation rights, incentive,
bonus, change in control, pension, retirement, deferred compensation, post-
retirement medical or life insurance, welfare, incentive, sick leave or other
leave of absence, short- or long-term disability, retention, severance, salary
continuation, medical, dental, vision, life insurance and material fringe
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, in any case, established,
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by any of the

 



       
 

 



 

Purchased Companies for the benefit of any employee, officer, director or
consultant who is a natural person (or single-member entity) of any Purchased
Company in each case in effect on the date hereof, or for which any Purchased
Company has any obligation or Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
plan, program, agreement or arrangement mandated or maintained by any
Governmental Entity shall be treated as a Benefit Plan.

 



 

(b) As applicable with respect to each material Benefit Plan, the Company has
made available to Parent, true and complete copies of (i) such Benefit Plan,
including all amendments thereto, (ii) the current summary plan description
and each summary of material modifications thereto, (iii) the most recent
annual report filed with any Governmental Entity (e.g., Form 5500) and (iv)
records, notices and filings or written communications concerning audits or
investigations by the IRS or Department of Labor or other Governmental Entity,
in each case under this clause (iv), within the last two years.

 



 

(c) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in accordance with
applicable Law. All material contributions to each Benefit Plan required to be
made by the Purchased Companies with respect to their respective employees
have been timely paid. There are no Litigations pending, or to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business) that would result in
material Liability to any Purchased Company. No "prohibited transaction"
(within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) has
occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan for which any material Liability or
material excise Tax for the Company under ERISA or the Code remains
outstanding. None of the Company nor any of its employees has breached his,
her, or its fiduciary duty with respect to the administration of any Benefit
Plan or the investment of the assets of any Benefit Plan, other than as would
not result in material Liability to any Purchased Company. To the Companys
Knowledge, no fiduciary within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA (other
than the entities and individuals in the previous sentence) has breached his,
her, or its fiduciary duty with respect to a Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in any material Liability or material excise
Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company.

 



 

(d) No Purchased Company sponsors, maintains, contributes to or is required to
contribute to, or has any Liability with respect to, (i) an "employee pension
benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, including any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) any "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning
of ERISA or the Code), or (iii) any self-insured group health, life insurance
or long-term disability plan or voluntary employees beneficiary association
(within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code). No assets of any
Benefit Plan are invested in securities of the Purchased Companies or any
Affiliate. No Purchased Company would reasonably be expected to have any
Liability or obligation to provide postretirement health, medical or life
insurance benefits to the employees or former employees, officers, or
directors, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof of any Purchased Company,
except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits continuation Laws
and for which the covered individual pays the full premium for such coverage.

 



 

(e) The Benefit Plans that are "employee pension benefit plans" (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) and that are intended to meet the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Pension
Plan_ ") have each received a favorable determination letter, or in the case
of a pre-approved plan, the underlying plan has received an opinion or
advisory letter, from the IRS regarding the qualification of such Pension Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code, and, to the Companys Knowledge, nothing has
occurred as of the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to result in
the loss of such qualification.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(f)_ or as required by applicable
Law, (i) none of the Benefit Plans obligates the Purchased Companies to pay
any material separation, severance, termination or similar benefits solely as
a result of the Closing; (ii) neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of,
any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director, or
other service provider of any Purchased Company, or result in any acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any such payment, right, compensation or
benefit; and (iii) no such amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) to any employee, officer, director, or
other service provider of any Purchased Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) will be a Section 280G Payment (disregarding any payments or
benefits under any agreement or arrangement entered into or negotiated with
Parent or any of its Affiliates). No Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 



 

(g) To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances existing
or having arisen prior to the date hereof which have led or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a re-assessment by any social security authority of
social security contributions to be made by any of the Purchased Companies
relating to any period prior to the date hereof, except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to any Purchased
Company.

 



 

(h) With respect to any Benefit Plan maintained in Switzerland, all material
social security payments and material pension fund contributions relating to
any period prior to the Closing Date to be paid by the Purchased Companies
with respect to the employees of the Purchased Companies and to such Swiss
Benefit Plans in favor of the employees of the Purchased Companies have been
paid when due according to the applicable Laws and the respective regulations
of the applicable Benefit Plans or have been adequately provided for in the
Financial Statements. The Benefit Plans maintained in Switzerland have no
claim against the Purchased Companies or the Shareholder, other than for the
current ordinary contributions.

 



 

(i) According to applicable local accounting and actuarial rules, (i) the
commitments of the Swiss pension schemes to which the Purchased Companies are
affiliated are fully funded, and (ii) the Swiss pension schemes regarding the
current and former employees of the Purchased Companies are covered by more
than 100% pursuant to the latest actuarial reports.

 



 

Section 3.12. _Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) No Purchased Company is or has in the past three (3) years been party to a
collective bargaining agreement with a labor union with respect to its
employees, is currently negotiating any such collective bargaining agreement,
or is or has in the past three (3) years been subject to any bargaining order
relating to its relationship or dealings with its employees or any labor
organization.

 



 

(b) There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against any
Purchased Company pending, or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened before
the National Labor Relations Board or any other similar Governmental Entity,
with respect to the Purchased Companies relationship with its employees, that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, there is no pending labor strike, slowdown, work stoppage or
lockout by any Purchased Company employees against any Purchased Company. No
mass employee dismissals by any of the Purchased Companies that would give
rise to any notification requirement to any Governmental Entity under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar foreign Laws have
been announced since December 31, 2017 or are being planned.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each Purchased Company is, and in the past three (3) years has been, in
material compliance with all Laws relating to labor and employment with
respect to the Purchased Company employees. Within the past three (3) years,
there have not been any wage and hour claims, discrimination claims,
disability accommodation claims, or other employment claims or charges by any
employee or prospective employee of any Purchased Company, nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, are any such claims or charges under investigation by any
Governmental Entity, in each case, that if adversely determined against any
Purchased Company would reasonably be expected to be material to the Purchased
Companies, taken as a whole. Accruals for claims for compensation of overtime,
Sunday or night work, retained holidays, or similar potential claims of any
current or former employee of any of the Purchased Companies have been
properly made by the respective Purchased Company in accordance with the
applicable accounting principles. All employees of the Purchased Companies
have such valid working permit for which the responsibility lies with the
Purchased Companies and, to the Companys Knowledge, all of the employees of
the Purchased Companies have valid work permits for which the responsibility
of maintaining such permits lies with the respective employee. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Purchased
Companies, each individual who renders services to any Purchased Company is
properly classified under all applicable Laws as having the status of an
employee or independent contractor or other non-employee status. To the
Companys Knowledge, no employee or independent contractor of any Purchased
Company is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or arrangement,
including any confidentiality or non-competition agreement, that materially
and adversely affects or restricts the performance of such employees duties
for the Purchased Companies. No employee of any of the Purchased Companies is
subject to any site guarantee or special protection against dismissal beyond
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Schedule 3.12(d)_ sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date
hereof, of each employee of any Purchased Company, including for each such
employee: name, job title, hire date, full- or part-time status, Fair Labor
Standards Act designation, work location, current base compensation rate,
current target bonus percentage, any fringe benefits (other than benefits
applicable to all employees as set forth in _Schedule 3.11(a))_ , and, to the
Companys Knowledge, visa and greencard application status. With respect to
employees whose primary work location is in the United States, except as set
forth in _Schedule 3.12(d)_ , the employment of each employee is terminable at
will by the relevant Purchased Company without any penalty, Liability or
severance obligation incurred by any Purchased Company.

 



 

(e) No employee of any of the Purchased Companies is participating in any
equity incentive plans or has been granted any rights under any such plan,
which would give the employee any right to acquire or receive any shares,
quota shares, stocks, options, or any other participation rights in any of the
Purchased Companies. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not enable any employee of a Purchased Company to receive any
change of control or incentive bonus payment, which are to be paid by any of
the Purchased Companies, the Parent or the Merger Sub.

(a) _Schedule 3.13_ sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date

receipt of all Regulatory Approvals and Non-Governmental Consents, materially
violate or result in a material breach of or constitute a default under any
Law or Governmental Authorization to which Parent, Merger Sub or their

this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

of the Purchased Companies as Parent may reasonably request, provided that the

the other Purchased Companies, or their respective Affiliates (i) to provide
access to any Books and Records to the extent such Books and Records do not
pertain to the business of the Purchased Companies (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Books and Records with respect to those items set forth on
_Schedule 5.1(a)(i)_ ), and the Company shall be entitled to withhold access
to or redact any portion of such Books and Records, (ii) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company or the applicable Affiliate would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality, (iii) to disclose any information of the Purchased Companies
or any of their respective Affiliates that the Company reasonably determines
in good faith, after consultation with counsel, that access would give rise to
a material risk of waiving attorney-client privilege applicable to all or any
portion of such information, (iv) to take any action that would cause material
disruption to the business of the Purchased Companies or their respective
Affiliates, (v) contravene any applicable Law or any confidentiality
obligation in any binding Contract, (vi) to provide access to any information

and other information related thereto, (vii) to permit any environmental
sampling or testing with respect to the Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property or (viii) to disclose any information to the extent relating to the
Products listed in _Schedule 5.1(a)(viii)_ if the Company reasonably

due to its competitively sensitive nature; _provided further_ , that in the
case of clauses (iii) and (v), the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make alternative arrangements (including

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been

by using commercially reasonable efforts to seek any necessary consents from
third parties) to afford such access or furnish such access and information
without violating any applicable Law or Contract or jeopardizing attorney-
client privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section
5.1_ shall be directed to the Chief Business Development and Legal Officer of

(b) During the five (5) year period immediately following the Closing, subject
to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice from the Shareholder Representative
to Parent, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, afford the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholder Representatives officers and
other authorized Representatives, during normal business hours, reasonable
access to such Books and Records of the Surviving Company with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to the Closing in the possession of Parent or its
Affiliates at Closing that are reasonably necessary to prepare Tax Returns or
financial statements, comply with Tax audits or applicable regulatory
requirements, in each case, as the Shareholder Representative may reasonably
request solely for purposes of complying with any applicable Tax, financial
reporting or such regulatory requirements; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not require Parent or its Affiliates to (i) provide access to
any Books and Records to the extent such Books and Records do not pertain to
the business of the Purchased Companies (and Parent or its applicable
Affiliates shall be entitled to withhold access to or redact any portion of
such Books and Records), (ii) disclose any information of the Purchased
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates that Parent reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with counsel (internal or
external), that access would give rise to a material risk of waiving attorney-
client privilege applicable to such information, (iii) to take any action that
would cause material disruption to the business of the Surviving Company or
their respective Affiliates, or (iv) contravene any applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligation in any binding Contract; provided, further, that in
the case of the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iv), Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements (including by using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents from third
parties) to afford such access or furnish such access and information without
violating any applicable Law or Contract or jeopardizing attorney-client
privilege). The Shareholder Representative shall return any original Books and
Records it obtained pursuant to this _Section Section 5.1.(b)_ to Parent or
such Affiliate as soon as such Books and Records are no longer needed in
connection with the applicable circumstances described in the immediately
preceding sentence. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Shareholder Representative, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Company not to, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing,
intentionally destroy or otherwise dispose of any of such Books and Records of
the Purchased Companies without first offering to provide to the Shareholder
Representative, at its expense, such Books and Records or any portion thereof
which Parent or the Surviving Company may intend to destroy or dispose of.

Agreements and applicable Law to satisfy the conditions to Closing, and to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements as soon as practicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.2(d)_ will require any party to waive any

contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Article VIII_.

 



 

(e) Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company each shall, upon request by the other
and subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions, furnish the other

such documentation furnished by the parties to one another may be redacted or

another may be redacted or provided on an "outside counsel only" basis to the

to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company shall permit any of its officers or any other
Representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity with respect to any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to

applicable Law (including filings pursuant to the HSR Act) or a Governmental
Entity or (ii) by any listing agreement with any applicable national

Confidential Information without complying with the foregoing consultation and
comment obligation in connection with any regulatory or self-regulatory

survive the consummation of the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.5. _Directors  and Officers Exculpation; Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current
or former directors or officers (or persons holding similar positions) of any
Purchased Company currently indemnified by any Purchased Company
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided in their respective
Organizational Documents, indemnity or indemnification agreements or as
provided pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors (or similar
governing body) of any Purchased Company, as applicable, shall survive the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

their terms for a period of not less than [***] from the Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, for a period of not less than [***] from the Closing,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Purchased Company to, amend, modify
or terminate any Organizational Document, Contract or resolution regarding or
related to such indemnification matters.

 



 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall
cause each of the Purchased Companies to, honor all of the Purchased
Companies obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance
funds for expenses) the Covered Persons for acts or omissions by such Covered
Persons occurring prior to the Closing to the extent that such obligations of
any of the Purchased Companies exist on the date of this Agreement, whether
pursuant to Organizational Documents, indemnity or indemnification agreements,
board (or similar governing body) resolution or otherwise, and such
obligations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of the Organizational Documents of any of
the Purchased Companies, as the case may be, and such board (or similar
governing body) resolutions or indemnity or indemnification agreements from
the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any claims against such Covered Persons arising out of such acts or
omissions.

 



 

(c) For a period of not less than [***] from the Closing Date, to the fullest
extent permitted, and subject to any limitations imposed, by applicable Law
and the Organizational Documents of the applicable Purchased Company in effect
as of the date hereof, Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Purchased
Companies to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless their respective Covered
Persons and any employee of the Company or any other Purchased Company, as
applicable, who acts as a fiduciary under any Benefit Plan (each, a " _Subject
Party_ ") against all damages, losses, charges, liabilities, claims, demands,
actions, suits, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) as incurred (payable monthly
upon written request which request shall include reasonable evidence of the
Covered Losses set forth therein), to the extent arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened Litigation in respect of
actions or omissions by such Subject Party occurring at or prior to the
Closing in connection with such Subject Partys duties as an officer, director
or employee (or Persons holding similar positions) of the Company or any other
Purchased Company or as a fiduciary under any Benefit Plan, including in
respect of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (" _Covered
Losses_ ").

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(determined after the Closing) and their respective successors, assigns,
heirs, legatees and personal representatives (collectively, the " _Releasors_
"), covenants that none of such Persons shall institute any Litigation against
any of the current or former officers or directors (or Persons holding similar
positions) of the Company, or any Purchased Company, in their capacities as
such, with respect to any losses or other liabilities, actions or causes of
action, judgments, claims and demands of any nature or description
(consequential, compensatory, punitive or otherwise) arising from or relating
to actions occurring prior to the Closing, whether or not such Person would be
entitled to indemnification by the Purchased Companies under this _Section
5.5_ and, effective as of the Closing, each Releasor, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, hereby releases and forever discharges the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholder, and the directors and officers
(and Persons holding similar positions), managers, employees, equityholders,
Affiliates, agents, Representatives of the Purchased Companies, and their
respective successors and assigns (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and
collectively, " _Releasees_ ") from any and all Covered Losses, claims for
costs and attorneys fees, losses, charges, or liabilities of any nature
whatsoever (" _Claims_ ") in law, in equity, by contract, tort or otherwise,
or by reason of, relating to or arising from any fact, and which the

with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

Releasors now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the respective
Releasees arising prior to the Closing whether or not relating to claims
pending at, or asserted after, the Closing, and whether arising under any
federal, state or local civil or human rights law, or under any other local,
state, or federal law, regulation or ordinance, or under any public policy,
contract or tort, or under common law; or any claim for breach of contract,
tort, infliction of emotional distress, defamation, or any claim for costs,
fees, or other expenses, including attorneys fees incurred in these matters;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall operate to
release any Covered Losses or Claims on account of, arising out of, relating
to or under Parents or Merger Subs rights under this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or with respect to [***]. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that the Laws of many states provide substantially the following:
"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that such
provisions are designed to protect a Person from waiving claims which it does
not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, Parent and Merger Sub agree that,
effective as of the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub (on behalf of the
Releasors) shall be deemed to waive any such provision.

 



 

(e) Parent shall purchase for the benefit of the Purchased Companies
directors and officers (at a cost of no more than [***]% of the annual premium
currently being paid by the applicable Person(s)), a [***] extended reporting
period endorsement under the existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies of such Person(s) (the " _D andO Insurance_"), providing that
such endorsement shall extend the directors and officers liability coverage
in force as of the date hereof for a period of [***] from the Closing for any
claims arising from events which occurred prior to the Closing. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company and the other applicable Purchased
Companies to, (i) upon the reasonable request of the Shareholder
Representative, make any claim for coverage under any such policy and
cooperate with the Shareholder Representative in seeking reimbursement for
Covered Losses under any such policy with respect to any such claim, (ii) keep
the Shareholder Representative reasonably informed as to the status of any
such claim and of any material communications with the insurance provider
under such policy with respect to any such claim, (iii) reasonably consult
with the Shareholder Representative in advance of submitting any material
written communication with respect to such claim to such insurance provider or
any meeting or conference with such insurance provider with respect to such
claim and (iv) upon the Shareholder Representatives reasonable request,
promptly furnish to the Shareholder Representative certificates of insurance
evidencing such policy no more than once per calendar year.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if any Covered Person
is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by any Person (including Cerberus
Capital Management, L.P. or its Affiliates) other than Parent or any Purchased
Company, such Covered Person shall not be required to recover from or be
indemnified by, or to seek such recovery or indemnification from, any such
other Person prior to or as a condition to being indemnified as described in
this _Section 5.5_; and (ii) in the event that any Person set forth on
_Schedule 5.5(f)_ is subject to any indemnification, reimbursement or similar
liabilities with respect to any Covered Person or otherwise incurs any Covered
Losses with respect to the subject matter of this _Section 5.5_ (including
Covered Losses in respect of contribution), Parent shall indemnify each such
Person from, against and with respect to any Covered Losses arising out of,
resulting from or otherwise in respect of such liabilities or Covered Losses.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and each other
Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 5.5_ of this
Agreement, and each such Persons heirs, legatees, representatives, successors
and assigns, it

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 5.5_ and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise. If Parent or the Surviving Company its respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations of
Parent set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Exclusive Dealing_. Except for the transactions contemplated
hereby and the transactions set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ hereto, during the
period from the date hereof through the Closing or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall not and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to (and shall not authorize any of them to), directly or
indirectly, take any action to facilitate, solicit, encourage, initiate,
engage or otherwise cooperate in any way (including by assisting a Person
other than Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives) in discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives) concerning any sale of the Equity Interests of, or license,
sale or other disposition of any material portion of the assets or
Intellectual Property Rights of (including by merger or consolidation), the
Purchased Companies, taken as a whole (other than the sale of inventory in the
ordinary course of business) (each such acquisition transaction, an "
_Acquisition Transaction_ "); _provided_ that each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and
its Affiliates have provided information relating to the Purchased Companies
and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such information,
access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis
for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by the Company or its
Affiliates of this _Section 5.6_. The Company shall, and shall direct their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, (a) immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
(other than Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction and (b) cease to
provide any confidential information (including by immediately terminating all
access to the Data Room and all information contained therein) to such
Person(s) and each of their Representatives.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Business Relations_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not
authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee, customer,
supplier, distributor or other material business relation of any Purchased
Company regarding any Purchased Company, its business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Insurance_. The Company shall keep all of the Insurance
Policies, or comparable replacements therefor, in full force and effect
through the Effective Time and such that the Insurance Policies will be in
full force and effect immediately following the Effective Time; provided that,
any such Insurance Policy may be amended or modified or substituted with
another insurance policy (including a change in insurance carriers), so long
as the coverage and limitations provided by such amended, modified or
substituted insurance policy are materially the same as in the respective
Insurance Policy so amended, modified or substituted.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Intercompany Agreements_. Prior to or in conjunction with the
Closing, and subject in all respects to _Section 5.5_, (a) the Purchased
Companies shall pay in full all Indebtedness and other amounts owing by or to
the Shareholder or any Affiliate of the Shareholder (other than a Purchased
Company) or any director, officer or partner of the Shareholder or any such
Affiliate on the one hand, to or

 



      
 

 



 

by, as applicable, any of the Purchased Companies, on the other hand, and (b)
the Purchased Companies shall terminate or shall cause to be terminated each
Contract (other than, in all cases, the Ancillary Agreements) with respect to
any intercompany Indebtedness or other expense or obligation and each other
Contract between any Purchased Company, on the one hand, and the Shareholder
or any Affiliate of the Shareholder (other than a Purchased Company) or any
director, officer or partner of the Shareholder or any such Affiliate, on the
other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing will not impact the
rights of any of the foregoing Persons to reduce payments under and in
accordance with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Swiss Property Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain and to cooperate in obtaining the clearances and
waivers set forth on _Schedule 5.10_ (collectively, the " _Swiss Property
Approvals_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable. Attached hereto as Exhibit I
are such applications in draft form (such drafts, when in final form, the "
_Swiss Filings_ "). Subject to the immediately following proviso, Parent and
the Company agree to make the Swiss Filings with the applicable Governmental
Entities as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but no later than
[***], _provided_ , _however_ , that, if (i) the land survey that is required
in connection therewith is not completed prior to [***] or (ii) the applicable
Governmental Entities schedule the in-person meeting with the applicable
Representatives of Parent, to be requested by Parents and the Companys Swiss
counsel promptly after the date hereof for a date after [***], in each case,
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, cooperate with one another and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Swiss Filings to be filed with the applicable
Governmental Entities as soon as reasonably practicable after such date. In
addition, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with, and promptly provide any required information
or documents to, the other party in such other partys efforts to obtain the
Swiss Property Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
be available for any meetings and other discussions with any Governmental
Entities at the first available time such Governmental Entity is available,
and to engage in any further discussions with such Governmental Entity as may
be necessary or useful to obtain the Swiss Property Approvals as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Company, one the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to seek from any applicable Governmental Entity
all waivers of appeal, early termination and similar consents and waivers as
soon as reasonably practicable, and the foregoing Persons shall cooperate with
each other in connection therewith. All fees required to be paid in connection
with the Swiss Property Approvals shall be borne by the Company (for the
avoidance of doubt, each party shall pay its own advisors fees and expenses).

 



 

(b) Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company each shall, upon request by the other
and subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions, promptly furnish the
other with all documentation concerning the Purchased Companies, Parent or
Merger Sub and such other matters as may be necessary or reasonably advisable
in connection with the Swiss Property Approvals; _provided_ that any such
documentation furnished by the parties to one another may be redacted or
provided on an "outside counsel only" basis to the extent necessary, either to
comply with applicable Law or to protect the confidentiality of information
that if furnished would not materially facilitate the other partys
understanding of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the Swiss
Property Approvals, including (i) promptly notifying the other of any facts,
circumstances or other reason that would prevent the receipt of any Swiss
Property Approvals for the timely consummation of transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications given, made or received
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to or from any third
party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Swiss Property Approvals;
_provided_ that any such notices furnished by the parties to one another may
be redacted or provided on an "outside counsel only" basis to the extent
necessary, either to comply with applicable Law or to protect the
confidentiality of information that if furnished would not materially
facilitate the other partys understanding of the status of matters relating
to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company shall permit any of its officers or any other
Representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity with respect to any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, or shall cause the Purchased Companies to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver of the right of first
refusal with respect to those parts of plots [***] of the Land Register of
Koniz that are located in the agricultural zone and leased from PaxVax Berna,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the " _RoFR Waiver_
") as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including by delivering
the RoFR Waiver to the leasee of such property no later than [***] and having
such leasee execute and deliver to the Company a legally enforceable RoFR
Waiver as soon as reasonably practicable after such date. All fees required to
be paid in connection with obtaining and notarizing the RoFR Waiver shall be
borne by the Company.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Other Actions_. Following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause the other applicable Purchased Companies to,
take the actions set forth on _Schedule 5.11_.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by any party hereto, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take,
or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as a party hereto may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and, subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.12_ will require any party
to waive any condition to such partys obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Article VIII_.

 



 

Section 5.13. _R andW Insurance_. The parties hereto acknowledge that, as of the
date hereof, Parent has obtained a binder to the RandW Insurance Policy, a true
and correct copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit K_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain and
bind, and shall obtain and bind, the RandW Insurance Policy, which shall contain
terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent than the terms
and conditions as set forth in _Exhibit K_, except as consented to by the
Shareholder Representative in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld); _provided_ that, in all events, the RandW Insurance Policy shall
provide that (a) the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not pursue any
and all, subrogation rights against the Shareholder, the Shareholder
Representative, any Selling Party or any Non-Recourse Party of the foregoing,
[***], (b) the Shareholder, the Shareholder

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, any Selling Party and any Non-Recourse Party of the foregoing
shall be third party beneficiaries of such waiver and (c) following the
Closing, Parent shall not amend the subrogation provisions of the RandW
Insurance Policy in any manner adverse to the Shareholder, the Shareholder
Representative, any Selling Party or any Non-Recourse Party of any of the
foregoing, in each case, without the Shareholder Representatives express
prior written consent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **EMPLOYMENT MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.1. _Employee Benefits_. Except (a) as provided in a written
agreement between any Purchased Company and any individual who remains
employed by a Purchased Company at the Effective Time (each such individual, a
" _Continuing Employee_ "), or (b) as otherwise required by applicable Law,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date which
is [***] after the Closing Date (or if earlier, the date of such Continuing
Employees termination of employment with the Parent and its Affiliates) (the
" _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide each Continuing Employee: [***]. If Parent ceases to maintain any
particular Benefit Plan during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the date which is [***] after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates or the Purchased Companies to (x) provide coverage
for Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under its or their
medical, dental and health plans without interruption of coverage; (y) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirements and waiting periods and (z) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Plans to honor any
expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under similar plans of the Purchased Companies during the portion of the
calendar year up to the date that coverage under a Benefit Plan is replaced
with coverage under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Nothing herein
shall prevent Parent, its Affiliates or the Purchased Companies from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee during the Continuation
Period in compliance with applicable Law. If requested by Parent in a writing
delivered to the Company following the date hereof and not less than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all reasonable action
(including the adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of
required notices) necessary to terminate, effective at least one day prior to
the Closing (contingent on the occurrence of Closing), any Benefit Plan
maintained by a Purchased Company that is intended to constitute a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan under Code Section 401(k). The Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices
and other documents prepared to effectuate the termination of such plan or
plans in advance and provide Parent with the final documentation evidencing
the termination. Parent shall allow each Continuing Employee to immediately
enroll in a Parent Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Code Section 401(k) and shall allow each Continuing
Employee to make a rollover contribution of their account balance under any
401(k) plan terminated in accordance with this _Section 6.1_ to such Parent
Plan (including outstanding loans and associated promissory notes).

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.2. _[***] and Benefit Accrual_. For purposes of [***] in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing, and
[***], Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give [***] (excluding,
for clarity, (i) any equity related incentive compensation plan or (ii) any
Swiss defined benefit pension plan in which such Continuing Employee was not
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service [***] benefits.

 



 

Section 6.3. _WARN_. On or as soon as practicable after the Closing, the
Shareholder Representative shall provide Parent with a true and complete list
of all employees of any Purchased Company whose employment has been terminated
within the ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, or whose work hours
have been reduced by greater than 50% within each month of the six (6) month
period preceding the Closing Date, which list shall indicate the employees
name, site of employment, starting date of employment, and date of such
termination or reduction in work hours. Subject to the Shareholder
Representative providing the list described in the preceding sentence, Parent
shall be responsible for compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (" _WARN Act_ ") and any similar applicable Law for any plant
closings, mass layoffs, employee layoffs, or similar events caused or
implemented by Parent or any Purchased Company. The parties will cooperate in
good faith with regard to any notification that may be required by the WARN
Act or other similar applicable Law as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4. _No Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Article VI_ shall (i) be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise limit the right of the
Company, Parent, or their respective Affiliates (including the Purchased
Companies), to amend, modify or terminate any such employee benefit plan or
(ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Article
VI_.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Section 280G Payments_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Shareholder approval
(in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto) of any payments or benefits that
would, absent the Shareholders approval, reasonably be expected to be excess
parachute payments in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder
(" _Section 280G Payments_"). Prior to such Shareholder approval, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from any
disqualified individuals (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations thereunder) of any "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) that could be made to them in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such that unless such payments
and benefits to such individuals are approved by the Shareholder to the extent
and in the manner required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code, no such payments and benefits that would be "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) shall be made. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent written certification that
either (a) the requisite Shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any
Section 280G Payments that were subject to a shareholder vote, or (b) that the
Shareholders approval of Section 280G Payments was not obtained and, as a
consequence, that such payments and benefits shall not be made or provided to
any affected individual who had duly executed a waiver of those payments and
benefits to the extent that such payments and benefits would cause any amounts
to constitute Section 280G Payments, or (c) a statement that commercially
reasonable efforts were used, however, the Company was unable to obtain
waivers or the requisite shareholder approval. True and complete copies of all
disclosures, waivers, consents, and shareholder voting materials used in
connection with the foregoing shall be provided to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days in advance of distribution to the Shareholder or the
disqualified individuals, as

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, for Parents review and comment. The Company shall consider and
incorporate Parents reasonable comments. To the extent that Parent or any of
its Affiliates enter into or negotiate compensation arrangements with any
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) of any of
the Purchased Companies that could result in such Persons receipt of any
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) (" _Parent
Payments_ "), then Parent shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
days prior to the date the Company intends to distribute any materials in
connection with the equityholder vote described in this _Section 6.5_)
provide the Company with the amount, if any, of the Parent Payments that are
required to be included in the Code Section 280G calculations and waiver
materials (along with a description of such "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Code Section 280G)), and the failure of the shareholder vote
described above to comply with the requirements of Code Section 280G as the
result of Parents failure to comply with such obligation shall not be treated
as a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

 **TAX MATTERS**

party with the primary responsibility for filing Tax Returns under applicable
Law with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall file, or cause to be filed, at
its own expense all Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes. The party filing such Tax Returns shall notify the other party

shall reimburse the first party for its portion of such Transfer Tax liability
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Assistance and Cooperation_. Following the Closing Date, each of
Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall cooperate fully in preparing

or other relevant information necessary or useful for such purposes, in each
case, whether or not in existence as of the Closing Date.

Representative and its Affiliates, or their agents upon reasonable request and
upon reasonable notice during normal business hours. After the expiration of

costs of transferring the Books and Records to be paid by the Shareholder
Representative in accordance with _Section 5.1(b)_.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Tax Treatment; Merger Consideration Allocation_. For U.S.

Representative shall cooperate in good faith to allocate the Final Merger
Consideration Amount (together with any Additional Merger Consideration Amount
and other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) among the PaxVax Targets prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall be
permitted to make an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to
such of the PaxVax Targets that are not U.S. persons (within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) (and any Subsidiaries thereof) in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not make any such
election with respect to PaxVax U.S. (and any Subsidiary thereof) without the
written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent may be
withheld in its sole discretion. The parties to this Agreement and their
respective Affiliates shall file all relevant Tax Returns consistently with
this _Section 7.4_, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Apportioned Obligations_. In the case of any taxable period

" _Straddle Tax Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income, sales, use, receipts or other similar items of the Purchased Companies
for the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the
Purchased Companies for a Straddle Tax Period which relate to the portion of
the Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Tax Period.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Tax Sharing and Tax Indemnification Agreements_. Any Tax sharing
and Tax indemnification agreement to which any of the Purchased Companies is
party shall be terminated with respect to such Purchased Company as of the

Section 7.8. _Interpretation_. To the extent there is any inconsistency
between this _Article VII_, on the one hand, and the terms and conditions of

not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1.(b)_ at any time
during which Parent or Merger Sub is in material breach of this Agreement so

Representative or the Company of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement which, in either case, would prevent the satisfaction of or result
in the failure of any condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub at

Merger Sub or, in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under this
Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by the Shareholder

Section 11.2. _Amendment; Modification; Waiver_. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if,
such amendment, modification, or waiver is explicitly set forth in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment or modification, by Parent and the
Shareholder Representative, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom such waiver is intended to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 



 

Section 11.3. _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative, except that without obtaining such consent Parent or Merger
Sub or the Surviving Company may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its obligations, in its sole discretion, under this Agreement to any of their
respective controlled Affiliates (provided that Parent shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder) and (b) the
Company may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent; any
purported assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void _ab
initio_. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 11.3_, _Section
5.5_, _Section 11.5_, _Section 11.15_, _Section 11.18_, _Article IX_ or
_Article X_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto, and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. [***] (y) the Shareholder is
a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may suffer losses for any
breach of this Agreement by Parent (or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Company) or Merger Sub, and (z) _Section 11.15_, _Section 9.2_, _Section
11.6_, _Section 11.9_, _Section 11.10_ and this sentence of _Section 11.3_
shall be enforceable by each Selling Party and each applicable Non-Recourse
Party as if such Person was directly party hereto, to the

extent rights are granted in _Section 11.15_ are granted to such Person. The
provisions of this Agreement are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of the
Shareholder, and the Shareholder Representative shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to enforce any obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, or the
Surviving Company under this Agreement for the benefit of the Shareholder.

 



 

Section 11.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules,
Exhibits and Appendices hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede and
cancel all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, with respect to such matters. In the event and to the extent that
there shall be an inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or an Ancillary
Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed according to their fair meaning and neither for nor against
any party hereto irrespective of which party caused such provisions to be
drafted, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by an attorney in connection with
the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 11.5. _Satisfaction of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to
any other under this Agreement, that is performed, satisfied or fulfilled
completely by an Affiliate of such party shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 



 

Section 11.6. _Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed by any party to this
Agreement as required by their specific terms or were to be otherwise
breached, irreparable damage will occur to the non-breaching party and no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches, and to specific performance of the terms, of
this Agreement (including causing the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in
this Agreement) without posting any bond and without proving that monetary
damages would be inadequate, in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity.
No party hereto shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to
raise as a defense that an adequate remedy at Law exists or that specific
performance or equitable or injunctive relief is inappropriate or unavailable.
The parties hereto further agree that nothing in this _Section 11.6_ shall
require any party to institute any Litigation for (or limit any partys right
to institute any Litigation for) specific performance under this _Section
11.6_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article X_. If a party to this Agreement brings any Litigation to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party and the Outside Date has not yet passed, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which such
Litigation is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time
period established by the Chosen Court presiding over such Litigation, and for
the avoidance of doubt, if such Litigation is to cause the Closing to occur,
this Agreement may not be terminated during such Litigation by any party
hereto. If a party to this Agreement institutes a Litigation for injunctive
relief or specific performance and a court of competent jurisdiction does not
award injunctive relief or specific performance to such party in a Judgment in
accordance with this _Section 11.6_, then such party may institute a
Litigation for monetary damages. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if a party hereto is awarded injunctive relief or specific
performance as a result of which the Closing actually occurs, such equitable
relief shall be such partys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement
solely with respect to another partys failure to consummate the Closing. The
prevailing party in any Litigation arising under this _Section 11.6_ shall be
entitled to reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.7. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein, (a) all filing fees and similar expenses to be paid in
connection with the HSR Act or any other Competition/Investment Law shall be
paid by Parent, (b) the fees of Governmental Entities and similar expenses to
be paid in connection with the Swiss Property Approvals set forth in _Section
5.10_ shall be paid by the Company and shall be included in the calculation of
"Transaction Related Expenses" and (c) [***] shall pay [***] of all fees and
expenses relating to the Escrow Agent, any Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with the Merger, and the RandW Insurance Policy Premium, and [***] of
such Escrow Agent fees and expenses, Transfer Taxes and RandW Insurance Policy
Premium shall be included in the calculation of "Transaction Related
Expenses".

 



 

Section 11.8. _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter, or reference to any
Contract, in any Schedule referenced in _Article Article III_ or _Article
IV_ of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure of such matter or
Contract for purposes of any other Section of, or Schedule to, _Article
Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
applies to such other Section or Schedule, respectively, but shall not be
deemed to constitute an admission by Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or to
otherwise imply that any such matter or Contract is material for the purposes
of this Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of such term for the
purposes of this Agreement. In particular, (a) certain matters may be
disclosed on the Schedules that may not be required to be disclosed because of
certain minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, (b) the disclosure of any such matter does not mean that it meets
or surpasses any such minimum thresholds or materiality standards and (c) no
disclosure in the Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of
any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall
the listing of such matters in any Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand
the scope of the Companys representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. Each Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to specific
provisions of the Agreement and does not constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations, warranties or covenants of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Affiliates, except as and to the
extent provided in this Agreement. Matters reflected in a Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters or Contracts required by this Agreement to be
disclosed in such Schedules. The section headings in the Schedules are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any information disclosed herein or any provision
of this Agreement. All attachments to the Schedules are incorporated by
reference into the Schedule in which they are directly or indirectly
referenced. The information contained in the Schedules is in all events
subject to _Section 5.4_ and the Confidentiality Agreement.

application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be

or implied in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any document,

as provided to each other party in accordance with the notice provisions set

given pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or any other manner permitted by Law. Each
of the parties to this Agreement expressly and irrevocably agrees that service
in accordance with this _Section 11.16_ will be effective and sufficient
service of process upon the Company, the Shareholder Representative, Parent or

Section 11.18. _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges that Dechert currently serves as counsel to both (a) the
Purchased Companies on the one hand and (b) Cerberus Capital Management, L.P.
and its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies) on the other hand
(solely for purposes of this _Section 11.18_, Cerberus Capital Management,
L.P. and such Affiliates collectively " _Cerberus_ "), in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
hereunder and thereunder and the sale process leading up to the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Transactional Matters_ "). [***]. The parties
understand and specifically agree that [***] arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder, and even though [***] therefrom. Each of the parties
further agrees that, as to all communications among Dechert, the Purchased
Companies, and Cerberus arising out of or primarily related to the
Transactional Matters, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of
client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege that
attach as a result of Dechert representing the Purchased Companies in such
Transactional Matters shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect,
provided that any such privilege, from and after the Closing, shall belong to
Cerberus and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Purchased
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to privileged communications between Dechert and the Purchased
Companies that are not primarily related to or do not arise from the
Transactional Matters, the privilege will remain with the Purchased Companies
and is not waived under this Section 11.18. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps reasonably necessary to
ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Dechert representing the
Purchased Companies with any Transactional Matters shall survive the Closing,
remain in effect and be controlled by Cerberus. As to any privileged attorney
client communications between Dechert and any of the Purchased Companies

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately

requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Closing Date arising out of or primarily related to the
Transactional Matters (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "),
Parent and each of the Purchased Companies, together with any of their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree that no such Person may
use or rely on any of such Privileged Communications in any action or claim
against or involving any of the parties hereto after the Closing relating to
any Transactional Matters. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, Parent, the Purchased Companies and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall have no right of access to or
control over any of Decherts records related to the Privileged
Communications, which shall become the property of (and be controlled by)
Cerberus. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between Cerberus and the
Purchased Companies arising out of or relating to or in connection with any
Transactional Matter, none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will
protect from disclosure to Cerberus any information or documents developed or
shared during the course of Decherts joint representation of Cerberus and the
Purchased Companies.

 



 

Section 11.19. _Deliveries to Parent_. Parent agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered to Parent, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives (including Covington and Burling LLP) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made
available in the Data Room on or before the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered, provided or
made available to Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives.

 



 

Section 11.20. _Shareholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 11.20_, the Company
hereby designates PaxVax SH Representative LLC as the Shareholder
Representative to serve, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that the
Shareholder Representative shall serve, as the sole representative of the
Shareholder, from and after the date hereof with respect to the matters set
forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, such service to be
without compensation except for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
specifically provided herein. The Shareholder Representative has accepted such
designation as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholder
Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly
set forth herein, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties or Liabilities on behalf of the Shareholder shall otherwise exist
against the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder Representative has been irrevocably appointed as the
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for the Shareholder for all purposes of this
Agreement, has the full power and authority to act on the Shareholders
behalf, including: (i) to take all actions or refrain from taking any actions
which the Shareholder Representative considers necessary or desirable in
connection with the defense, pursuit or settlement of any determinations
relating to the payment of the Escrow Amount, and any claims in connection
with this Agreement [***] or any Ancillary Agreement, including to sue,
defend, negotiate, settle and compromise any such claims made by or against,
and other disputes with, Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (ii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, Ancillary
Agreements, certificates and documents that the Shareholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) receive funds, make
payments of funds and give receipts of funds, (iv) to engage and employ agents

all actions

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this _Section 11.20_, (vi) to accept and receive notices to
the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement and (vi) to take or refrain from
taking all other actions and exercise all other rights which the Shareholder
Representative (in its sole discretion) considers necessary or appropriate in
connection with this Agreement or the any other Ancillary Agreement (including
entering into any amendments that the Shareholder Representative deems
desirable without the consent of the Shareholder). The Shareholder, by
accepting any portion of the Final Merger Consideration Amount and Additional
Merger Consideration Amount, agreed that such agency and proxy are coupled
with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Shareholder Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Shareholder. All decisions and
acts by the Shareholder Representative are binding upon the Shareholder, and
the Shareholder does not have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are
hereby made, and are hereby acknowledged to be, dependent on the
determinations and actions that are contemplated or permitted to be made by
the Shareholder Representative pursuant to such appointment, and all rights of
the Shareholder shall be qualified by and dependent upon such determinations
and actions, irrespective of whether the Shareholder Representative is acting
as an agent or power of attorney of the Shareholder.

 



 

(c) The Shareholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Shareholder, and the other parties hereto shall be entitled to rely on any and
all action taken by the Shareholder Representative without any liability to,
or obligation to inquire of, the Shareholder. Each of the other parties hereto
is expressly authorized to rely on the genuineness of the signature of the
Shareholder Representative and, upon receipt of any writing which reasonably
appears to have been signed by the Shareholder Representative, the other
parties hereto may act upon the same without any further duty of inquiry as to
the genuineness of the writing. For clarity, following Parents payment in
full to the Shareholder Representative of any amount required to be paid by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and its Non-Recourse Parties shall
have no liability to the Shareholder or any of the Shareholders Non-Recourse
Parties for such amount, including for the Shareholder Representatives
failure to distribute such amounts in any manner, including in accordance with
separate agreements with the Shareholder and the Shareholders Non-Recourse
Parties.

 



 

(d) Neither the Shareholder Representative, nor any agent employed by it, nor
Parent or any of its Non-Recourse Parties, shall be liable to the Shareholder
relating to the performance of the Shareholder Representatives duties under
this Agreement for any errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of
duty or otherwise by the Shareholder Representative, except the Shareholder
Representative may be liable to the extent it is finally determined in a court
of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions
taken or not taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted willful
misconduct. The Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Shareholder against all Losses paid or incurred in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or claim to which the Shareholder
Representative is made a party by reason of the fact that it was acting as the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted willful misconduct. The
Shareholder Representative shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
statement or certificate believed by him to be genuine and to have been
furnished by the appropriate Person and in acting or refusing to act in good
faith or any matter.

 



 

(e) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Shareholder Representative shall provide written notice to Parent of the
amount of cash (the " _Shareholder Representative Expense Amount_ ") that will
be retained from the Base Closing Cash Amount by the Shareholder
Representative to pay (at the Shareholder Representatives sole discretion),
(i) any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative
related to the negotiation, preparation, execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements (to the extent not paid at
the Closing) and (ii) any fees, expenses, costs, losses or damages it incurs
in performing its duties and obligations under this Agreement, including fees,
