agreements, pooling agreements, voting trust agreements or other voting
agreements with respect to the voting of the Purchased Shares. The Purchased
Shares constitute all of the outstanding issued share capital of the Company.

except for such authorizations, consents, approvals and filings as to which
the failure by the Vendor to obtain or make would not prevent or materially
delay the consummation of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (h) | No Interference. There is no action, suit, investigation or other
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Vendor, threatened before any
court, arbitrator, governmental body, agency or official that in any manner

likely to give rise to any of the foregoing. 
---|--- 



   (i) | No Insolvency. No insolvency or similar proceedings have been or,
to the knowledge of the Vendor, have been threatened to be, commenced over the
assets of the Vendor or the Company and, to the knowledge of the Vendor,

application for such proceedings. The Vendor and the Company are not illiquid
( _zahlungsunf ahig_) or over-indebted ( _u berschuldet_).

legal and beneficial owner of all fixed assets ( _Anlageverm ogen_) and of all
current assets ( _Umlaufverm ogen_) (collectively the "Assets"), with good
title thereto, free and clear of Encumbrances, except for the Assets: (i)
which have been disposed of since the date of the Annual Financial Statements

Vendor or Vendors Affiliates) except for the Permitted Encumbrances. Subject
to the discharge of the Encumbrances related to the Loan Agreements, the
Guarantee Agreements and the Factoring Agreement, the Company is free to
dispose of the Assets in any manner, and such dispositions do not violate any
legal obligations of the Company. The Assets and any assets leased by the

Company, are in reasonable working order and repair (normal wear and tear
excepted), are fit for the intended use, and are in a condition and
quantity adequate to conduct the Business of the Company as currently
conducted, except for the maintenance, repair and replacement required in the

Adverse Impact on the ability of the Company to continue to operate the
Business as presently conducted following the Closing.

in such real property, and correctly states for each such piece of real estate
the location, applicable land register or other identification data, size,
use, type of legal title, co-owners, if any, and encumbrances (collectively,
the "Real Property"). The Company does not own, lease or have interests in or
occupy any real property or interest in real property other than the Real
Property. The Real Property is all the real property that is used by the
Business. The Companys interest in the Real Property is free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances. The Real Property is not
subject to any unregistered or otherwise pending transfer or other
disposition or any sale, contribution or other contractual arrangement
creating an obligation to transfer any real estate or to create or change any
Encumbrances. All real estate Taxes, development charges and other
public charges payable with respect to the Real Property which have become or
will become due prior to the Closing Date have been fully paid, will be paid

breach the Vendor of the obligations in Sections 5.9 and 5.10, the remedies

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES IN CASE OF BREACH



   7.1 | _General_ 
---|--- 

Within thirty (30) Business Days after having received notice of a breach of
one or more of the Vendors Guarantees or any other of the Vendors
obligations under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall notify the Vendor in
writing thereof, reasonably specifying such breach (to the extent reasonably
possible underlying the facts, legal basis for possible claims and an
estimation of potential damages to be claimed by the Purchaser) and to the
extent Purchaser has collected any evidence, provide such evidence in order
to enable the Vendor to assess the merits of a possible breach ("Claim
Notice"); provided, however that the Purchasers failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
as provided for in Section 7.2(c). At the option of the Purchaser, (i) the
Vendor shall have the right to remedy the relevant breach within thirty (30)
days after having received the Claim Notice by putting the Purchaser in the
position in which it would be in had the relevant Vendors Guarantee not been
breached ("restitution in kind", _Naturalrestitution_ ) or (ii) the Purchaser
shall be entitled to demand from the Vendor compensation in money (
_Schadensersatz in Geld_ ) according to §§ 249 et seq. German Civil Code (
_BGB_ ) ( _Schaden_ ) incurred by the Purchaser, including reasonable legal,
accounting and other fees and expenses of professional advisors, but
excluding (i) any lost profits ( _entgangener Gewinn_ ), (ii) any loss of
goodwill or reputational damages, (iii) any punitive or exemplary damages in
an amount equal to the actual and direct loss suffered by the Purchaser; and

aden_). The Purchaser shall further be excluded from asserting any claims for
damages due to a recalculation of the Purchase Price.

     | (ii) | any act or omission agreed in, and in compliance with, this
Agreement or otherwise requested or approved by the Purchaser in writing. 
---|---|--- 
 



   (c) | The Vendors liability under or in connection with this Agreement
shall be reduced by any quantifiable amount, as such amount is determined by
the competent arbitral tribunal, which is caused by the Purchasers non-
compliance with its statutory obligations to mitigate damages under § 254 of
the German Civil Code. 
---|--- 
 



37 this Agreement in respect of: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | all matters disclosed in the appropriate section of the

apply.



   (e) | The Vendor shall further not be liable under or in connection
with this Agreement in respect of any claim to the extent that the Purchaser

otherwise from any third party based on any claim that the Purchaser or the
Company has against any third party that reduces the losses that the Purchaser
or the Company would otherwise suffer, and (ii) the Purchaser or the Company
have actually received any proceeds of any claims under any insurance policy
that reduces the losses that that the Purchaser or the Company would otherwise
suffer. 
---|---

with this Agreement in respect of any claim to the extent the Company has
immediately quantifiable and non-assessable Tax benefit arising directly from
such loss. Such future, quantifiable Tax benefit shall be valued at its net
present value calculated at a discount rate of three percent (3%) per annum, a

The Vendors liability under this Agreement shall be limited to an aggregate
maximum amount corresponding to fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price.
Such maximum liability shall not apply to breaches of Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b),

40,000,000. Such maximum liability shall not apply to breaches of Sections

this Agreement, Corporate Approvals, Approvals and Consents and Funding of
the Purchase Price) and to the obligations in connection with: (i) the post-
Closing adjustments set forth at Section 2.2(b); and (ii) the Purchasers
covenants set forth in Article 5. With respect to any obligation where the

be limited to the Purchase Price. 



   7.5 | _Time Limitations_

---|--- 
 



39 ---|--- 

In the event that a claim against the Purchaser or the Company is asserted by
a third party which results, or which Purchaser believes to result, from a
breach of the provisions of this Agreement ("Third Party Claim") the following
shall apply: 



   (a) | No admissions in relation to such Third Party Claim shall be made
by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any of the Purchasers Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Company) and the Third Party Claim shall not
be compromised, disposed of or settled without the prior written consent of
the Vendor, which shall not be unreasonably (taking into account the interest
of the Company) withheld or delayed.  
---|--- 



   (b) | If the Vendor wishes to defend the Purchaser or the Company
against the Third Party Claim in its or their name and on its or their behalf,
the Vendor shall notify the Purchaser accordingly within a period of three
(3) weeks after having been notified of the Third Party Claim. Upon such
notification, the Vendor shall be entitled to take in good faith any action to
defend, and appeal the Third Party Claim (including the assertion and pursuit
of justifiable ( _vertretbar_ ) counter-claims or other claims against any
third parties) in the name and on behalf of the Purchaser or the Company.
However, the Vendor shall not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall, or
procure that the Company shall, promptly give all assistance and information
to the Vendor as may be reasonably required to defend the Third Party Claim
and in particular promptly forward all notices, communications and filings
(including court papers). 
---|---

guarantee set forth in Section 3.1(u) if and to the extent such breach is
caused by the Companys investigations, preparatory or exploratory activities
(including excavation and work plans/engineering undertaken that are not in
the ordinary course of business) after the Closing Date which were not
required pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws or a Governmental
Authority, unless such investigations, preparatory or exploratory activities
were in connection with construction on the Real Property relating to the
expansion or reduction of the Business or the demolition of any structures in
the context of the Business operating in the normal course. This limitation of
liability shall not apply to any such actions taken by the Purchaser pursuant
to a requirement of a Governmental Authority.



   7.8 | _Specific Exclusions and Waivers_ 
---|--- 
 

The rights and remedies of the Purchaser provided in this Agreement shall be
the exclusive and sole remedy for the Purchaser against the Vendor,

intent ( _Vorsatz_ ) or bad faith ( _Arglist_ ). The intent of Persons
assisting the Vendor ( _Erf ullungsgehilfen_) shall not be attributed to the
Vendor pursuant to § 278 of the German Civil Code. Any representation made by
the Vendor in this Agreement, in particular the Vendors Guarantees pursuant

to disclose certain matters regarding the Company.



   7.9 | _Payments Deemed to be Adjustment of Purchase Price_ 
---|--- 

Payments made by the Vendor or the Purchaser, as the case may be, pursuant to

fraction of the Purchase Price.



   7.10 | _Breach of Purchaser s Guarantees_ 
---|--- 

In case of a breach of the Purchasers Guarantees under Section 3.2 under this

   8.1 | _Taxes_ 
---|--- 

"Taxes" shall mean any tax within the meaning of § 3 of the German Tax Code (
_AO_ ) or any taxes under the Laws of any other jurisdiction (including any
withholding of amounts paid to or by or on behalf of any Person), together
with any penalties, fines, interest or additions thereto and any secondary
liability ( _Haftungsschuld_ ) for Taxes and social security charges but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, deferred taxes and notional tax losses
(such as reductions of loss carry forwards or future depreciation) imposed
under the applicable Laws by any competent Governmental Authority of public
body in charge of imposing Taxes (a "Tax Authority"). Except as otherwise
provided herein, Article 7 does not apply to claims under this Article 8.



   8.2 | _Indemnification_ 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Vendor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and
the Company against any Taxes imposed under applicable Laws and relating to
the Company (a "Tax Indemnification Claim"), 
---|--- 



     | (i) | for periods ending on or before the Closing Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | for the Pre Closing Straddle Period. 
---|---|--- 
 



41 to the Closing Date and which ends after the Closing Date (the "Straddle
Period"), the portion of the Taxes allocable to the period which begins prior
to the Closing Date and ends on the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Straddle
Period") shall be calculated as if the Pre-Closing Straddle Period is equal to
a fiscal period ( _Veranlagungszeitraum_ ). 
---|--- 



   (c) | The Tax Indemnification shall be due five (5) days before the Tax
amount falls due but not earlier than ten (10) days after receipt of the
notification of the Tax Indemnification Claim. 
---|--- 

For greater certainty, there are not and shall not be any accrued Taxes
payable for the period ending on or before the Closing Date or the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period in the calculation of Working Capital or the Final
Closing Working Capital. The Parties agree that there shall not be any
duplication in the payment of any amounts pursuant to a Tax Indemnification
Claim.



   8.3 | _Tax Releases, Tax Benefits_ 
---|--- 

In relation to tax releases, tax benefits and changes in accounting and
filing practices relating to period prior to the Closing Date, the following
shall apply:



   (a) | If the Company is entitled to any refund of Taxes with regard to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period and the refund of Taxes is not recorded as receivable in the Annual
Financial Statements 2012, the Company shall be obliged to transfer any such
payment within twenty (20) Business Days to the Vendor except the Purchaser
can set off such refund with a Tax Indemnification Claim. 
---|--- 



   (b) | If the Company is entitled to or could receive any benefits by
refund, set-off or reduction of Taxes as the result of an adjustment or
payment giving rise to a Tax Indemnification Claim, then the corresponding
benefit shall reduce the Tax Indemnification Claim of such Taxes. This shall
in particular, but without limitation, apply to any Tax benefits arising after
the Closing Date resulting from the lengthening of any amortization or
depreciation periods, higher depreciation allowances or carry forwards of
losses or deductions. Section 7.2(f) shall apply accordingly. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | The Vendor shall not be responsible for any Tax liabilities
attributable to periods ending on or before the Closing Date or the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period resulting from: (i) any change in the accounting and
taxation principles or practices of the Company (including methods of
submitting taxation returns) introduced after the Closing Date, except if
required under mandatory Law; (ii) any transaction, action, omission,
declaration or other measure initiated or executed by Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, (including, but not limited to, the
change in the exercise of any Tax election right, the amendment of any
Tax Return without the consent of the Vendor, the termination of any profit
and loss pooling agreement or Tax consolidation scheme, the approval or
implementation of any reorganizational measure, the omission to file a notice
pursuant to the German  _Reorganisation Tax Act_ ( _Umwandlungssteuergesetz_
) in order to maintain a beneficial tax status or the sale of any asset);
(iii) Taxes which with reasonable efforts can be or have been recovered from a
third party; or (iv) any change of the law or of guidelines or decrees of a
Tax Authority published after the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



42 ---|--- 

The Purchaser shall keep the Vendor fully informed regarding the commencement
of any Tax audit or other proceeding which may give rise to a Tax
Indemnification Claim. If a claim for Taxes, including, without limitation,
notice of a pending or threatened tax audit, is made by any Tax Authority (a
"Tax Claim") which, if successful, may result in an Tax Indemnification Claim,
the Purchaser shall immediately notify the Vendor in writing of the Tax Claim
so that at least fifteen (15) Business Days remain for filing an appeal on
the date of the Vendors receipt of the Purchasers notice. The Vendor shall
consult the Purchaser regarding the representation of the interests of the
Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period, but the Vendor may employ counsel of its choice at its
expense and may reasonably instruct Purchaser in respect to the settlement of
such Tax Claim. The Purchaser or the Company shall submit to the Vendor all
such relevant information and documents which are necessary to defend against
any Tax Claim. Furthermore, the Purchaser or the Company shall render
such support reasonably requested by the Vendor.



   8.5 | _Tax Returns_ 
---|--- 

All Tax Returns relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period are to be prepared and filed by the
Vendor or the Company. If Tax Returns relating to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period have not been
filed by the Vendor, the Purchaser or the Company shall prepare any such Tax
Returns at the costs of the Vendor in accordance with applicable Tax Laws with
respect to the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, but shall not file or cause to be
filed such Tax Returns with the competent Tax authorities without the prior
written consent of the Vendor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, and the Vendor shall respond within a period of twenty (20)
Business Days. Tax Returns relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall not be amended or
changed by the Purchaser without the prior written consent of the Vendor,
except where the amendment or change is required by mandatory Tax Law.



   8.6 | _Cooperation in Tax Matters_ 
---|--- 

The Vendor, the Company and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives reasonably to cooperate (each at their own expense), in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims
for refund), including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Tax Claims and in resolving all disputes
and audits with respect to all periods ending on or before the Closing Date
or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period.



   8.7 | _No Indemnity_ 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Vendor shall not indemnify or hold
harmless the Purchaser from or against any liability for Taxes attributable to
a breach by the Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement.
