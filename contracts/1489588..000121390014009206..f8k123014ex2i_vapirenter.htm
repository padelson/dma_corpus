confidence, and will cause their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, and advisors to maintain in confidence, any written, oral, or other
information obtained in confidence from another Person in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless (a) such
information is already known to such Party or to others not bound by a duty
of confidentiality or such information becomes publicly available through no
fault of such Party, (b) the use of such information is necessary or
appropriate in making any required filing with the SEC, or obtaining any

Party") shall provide the Person that provided such information (the
"Providing Party") with prompt notice of any such requirement so that the
providing party may seek a protective Order or other appropriate remedy and/or
waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 12.2_. If, in the
absence of a protective Order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by
the providing party, the disclosing party is nonetheless, in the opinion of
counsel, legally compelled to disclose the information of the
providing party, the disclosing party may, without liability hereunder,
disclose only that portion of the providing party's information which such
counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the
disclosing party exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the providing party's information, including, without

protective Order or other relief assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded the providing party's information.

  



  

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, each Party will return or destroy all of such
written information each party has regarding the other Parties.

presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any
reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or Law shall be
deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. Unless otherwise expressly provided,
the word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The Parties
intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall
have independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of such representation, warranty, or covenant. All words
used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances require.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by
facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file,
such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the Party
executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force
and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original
thereof.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Specific Performance._ Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the U.S. or any state thereof having
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the provisions
set forth in _Section 14.13_ below), in addition to any other remedy to which
they may be entitled, at Law or in equity.

Section 12.13 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction._ This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of California without regard to conflicts of Laws principles. Each
of the Parties submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the State of California, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of
the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Any
Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 12.3_ above. Nothing in this
_Section 12.13_ , however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law or at equity.

  



  

Section 12.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.
