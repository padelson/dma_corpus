have been fully paid in compliance with applicable Laws, and the provision for Taxes on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet is sufficient in accordance with GAAP for all accrued and unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not
yet payable as of the date thereof. All Taxes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party have been fully paid in compliance with applicable Laws, or to the extent
they are not yet due, properly accrued. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently or has been a party to any Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax reimbursement agreement or arrangement, nor do they have any liability
for Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.1502-6 (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law), as transferee or successor, or by contract or otherwise (other than with respect to the
consolidated returns including only the Company and its Subsidiaries and other than obligations under credit agreements, lease agreements or other commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business containing customary Tax
allocation or gross-up provisions). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been the subject of any audit or other examination of Taxes by the Taxing Authorities of any nation, state or locality and, to the Company&#146;s Knowledge, no
such audit or other examination is contemplated or threatened. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of an audit or other examination of Taxes by the Taxing Authorities of any nation, state or locality for any period which
is currently unresolved or pending. No deficiency or proposed adjustment which has not been settled or otherwise resolved for any amount of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been asserted or assessed by any Taxing Authority.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived in writing any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes payable by any of them, which waiver is currently in effect. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement that would require the Company or such Subsidiary to make any payment that would constitute an &#147;excess parachute
payment&#148; for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude an item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (a)&nbsp;change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b)&nbsp;&#147;closing agreement&#148; as described in Section&nbsp;7121 of the

Section&nbsp;108(i) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any &#147;reportable transaction&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section&nbsp;1.6011-4(b). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section&nbsp;355 or

calculations with respect to the distribution of the Merger Consideration or any Future Distribution Amounts or each Securityholder&#146;s Pro Rata Percentage of any indemnification obligation), and (xiii)&nbsp;to do each and every act and exercise
any and all rights which such Person or the Securityholders are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement. Such agency, proxy and attorney-in-fact and all authority granted hereunder are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Person. If, after the execution of this Agreement, any Securityholder dies, dissolves or liquidates or
becomes incapacitated or incompetent, then the Representative is nevertheless authorized, empowered and directed to act in accordance with this Agreement as if that death, dissolution, liquidation, incapacity or incompetency had not occurred and
regardless of notice thereof. All decisions and actions by the Representative shall be binding upon all of the Securityholders, and no Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. </P>

institution selected by the Representative) as a fund for the fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any legal fees and expenses) of the Representative incurred in connection with the marketing of the Company, this Agreement, the
evaluation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other actions taken by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement, with any balance of the Holdback not utilized for such purposes to be returned to the Securityholders in accordance
with their Pro Rata Percentage. In the event that the Holdback shall be insufficient to satisfy the fees and expenses and other amounts payable by or on behalf of the Representative, the Representative shall be entitled to recover any remaining
expenses directly from the Securityholders. The Representative shall not have any obligation to personally advance funds in connection with the performance of any duties under this Agreement. </P>

Securityholders, pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;13.15(b)</U> (each, an &#147;<U>Authorized Action</U>&#148;), and each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Securityholder as fully as if such
Person had taken such Authorized Action. Buyer agrees that the Representative, solely in its capacity as the Representative, shall have no Liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a
final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or bad faith. Each Securityholder severally, for itself only and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Representative against all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with any action, suit or Proceeding to which the Representative is made a party by reason of the fact it is
or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) <U>Duties of the Representative</U>. The Representative
hereby accepts its obligations under this Agreement. The Representative shall have only the duties expressly stated in this Agreement, and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The Representative is not, by virtue of serving as
Representative, a fiduciary of the Securityholders or any other Person. The Representative, in its capacity as such, has no personal responsibility or Liability for any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(f) <U>Exculpation</U>. The Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent
employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Representative shall not be relieved of any Liability imposed by Law for fraud or bad faith. The Representative shall not be liable to the
Securityholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Representative in good faith, and, if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Person to whom
payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Securityholders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any Liability to any Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the
Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith. </P>

the Securityholders or any other Person any fees or other compensation for its services as the Representative under this Agreement. The Representative, however, shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Securityholders (based on their Pro Rata
Percentage of such expenses) for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services as the Representative under this Agreement. </P>

then the Securityholders that held a majority of the shares of voting Common Stock outstanding on the date hereof will appoint a new Person to serve as the Representative, subject to the Buyer&#146;s advance written approval of such replacement,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Until such appointment is effective, Buyer will be entitled to rely on the actions and statements of the previous Representative. </P>
