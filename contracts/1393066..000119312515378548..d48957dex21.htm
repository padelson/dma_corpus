corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), Atlas Paper Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and HC Capital Holdings 313A, LLC, a

Representative (as hereinafter defined). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in 
_Section 11.01_ of this Agreement. Buyer, Merger Sub, Representative (solely
in its capacity as Representative) and the Company are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Parties_ " and, individually, as a " _Party_."

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to merge Merger Sub with and into the Company with
the Company as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved the Merger and deemed it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders, and have directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the respective stockholders of Merger Sub and the Company for
adoption.

 

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I __

 

 _THE MERGER_

1.01  _Merger_. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving
company in the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

 

1.02 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause
a certificate of merger, in form and substance substantially similar to
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
and shall make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL to
complete the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such other time as Buyer and the Company shall agree and
shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 1.03 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Effective Time, all of the assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.04 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, with such amendments thereto as
set forth in Exhibit A of the Certificate of Merger, until amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.05 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

1.06 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law,
the directors and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers, as applicable, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.07 _Conversion of Securities_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties or any of the Securityholders, the
following shall occur:

(a) _Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and
the shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 1.07(c))_
shall be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to (the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(i) the Per Share Portion of the Closing Consideration, plus

 

(ii) the Per Share Portion of any Future Distribution Amounts.

 

(b) _Company Options_. Each Option that is unexercised and that is still in
effect as of the Effective Time shall be canceled and thereafter shall no
longer be exercisable but shall entitle the Optionholder, in cancellation and
settlement therefor, to receive an amount in cash equal to (the " _Option
Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(i) (A) the product of (1) the Per Share Portion of the Closing Consideration
and (2) the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to such Option, minus
(B) the aggregate exercise price of all such Option Shares (determined for
each Option held by such Optionholder by multiplying the exercise price of
such Option by the total number of Option Shares subject to such Option),
which amount shall be delivered to such Optionholder in accordance with
_Section 1.09_, plus

(ii) the product of (A) the Per Share Portion of any Future Distribution
Amounts and (B) the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant to such Option.

 



\- 2 - (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Common Stock held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as treasury stock or
held by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and no cash or
other consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.

 

(d) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.08 _Securityholder Payments; Letters of Transmittal_.

 

(a) The Representative shall act as paying agent in effecting payments to
Securityholders and the exchange of cash for (i) certificates which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Common Stock,
to the extent such shares are represented by certificates (" _Certificates_ ")
owned by Securityholders, and (ii) unexercised Options, in each case entitled
to payment pursuant to _Section 1.07_.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, to the
extent not delivered prior to the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to
each Securityholder a letter of transmittal in form and substance
substantially similar to _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "). Pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal, each Securityholder
shall, among other things, (i) approve the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, and the appointment of the Representative
in accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) agree to be bound by the provisions
applicable to it herein and (iii) provide an IRS Form W-9 to Buyer.

 

(c) The Letter of Transmittal shall direct each Securityholder to deliver to
the Representative: (i) all Certificates, if any, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed stock powers, representing the Common Stock held
by such holder, (ii) his or her unexercised Options, and (iii) a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions therein (collectively the " _Securityholder Deliveries_ "). If a
Securityholder delivers its Securityholder Deliveries to the Representative at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then at the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_, Buyer shall deliver to such Securityholder (or
to the Surviving Corporation in the case of amounts payable to Optionholders)
the portion of the consideration due to such Securityholder as described in
_Section 2.02(c)_, subject to any applicable withholding Tax requirements. If
a Securityholder does not deliver its Securityholder Deliveries to the
Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then
promptly after such delivery, the Representative shall deliver to such
Securityholder (or to the Surviving Corporation in the case of amounts payable
to Optionholders) the portion of the consideration due to such Securityholder
as described in  _Section 2.02(d)_, and, if applicable, any Future
Distribution Amount that such Securityholder is entitled to receive from the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation at that time, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax requirements. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate, if
any, or Option shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Common Stock or Option it theretofore
represented shall have been converted pursuant to  _Section 1.07_, without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any

 



\- 3 -  Certificate or Option shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of such fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate or Option to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the providing of an
indemnity by such Person against any claim that may be made with respect to
such Certificate or Option, Buyer or the Representative, as applicable, shall
issue to the applicable Securityholder making such affidavit (or to the
Surviving Corporation in the case of amounts payable to Optionholders), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or Option, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Common Stock or Options,
as applicable, represented by such Certificate or Option, as contemplated by
this _ARTICLE I_ , subject to any applicable withholding Tax requirements. If
any Merger Consideration or Future Distribution Amount (or any portion
thereof) is to be delivered to a Person other than the Securityholder in
whose name the applicable Certificates or Options surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered (or in whose name such shares of Common Stock are
registered on the books and records of the Company, in the case of
uncertificated shares), it shall be a condition to the payment of such portion
of any such consideration that the Certificates (or rights thereto as
registered on the books and record of the Company, in the case
of uncertificated shares) or Options so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes payable by
reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be
paid.

 

1.09 _Payments to Optionholders_. Buyer or the Representative, as applicable,
shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation any amounts that are payable to
any Optionholder under this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation agrees that
(a) within five (5) Business Days of receipt of any such amounts, or such
later date as such payment becomes due pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts to the
applicable Optionholders, in the amounts specified in accordance with this
Agreement, net of any required withholding Taxes, and (b) the Surviving
Corporation shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, timely deposit and
report such withholding Taxes.

1.10 _Required Withholding_. Each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled, after consultation with the Representative (but only with
respect to payments due to Stockholders), to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Securityholder such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or non-United
States Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be paid
over to the appropriate Taxing Authority (with copies of the appropriate
receipts for such payments provided to the Representative) and shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

1.11  _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by Stockholders (i) who have not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (ii) who have demanded,
properly in writing, payment for such shares of Common

 



\- 4 -  Stock, as applicable, in accordance with DGCL § 262 (a " _Dissenter Payment_
"), and (iii) who have not withdrawn such demand or been deemed to have
forfeited the right to a Dissenter Payment (such shares of Common Stock being
referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right
to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead will be
converted in to the right to receive the Dissenter Payment in accordance with
the DGCL, subject to all applicable withholding. If any Stockholder fails to
perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to a Dissenter
Payment for such shares of Common Stock under the DGCL, then, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such Stockholders
shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into and represent the
right to receive, without any interest thereon, a cash amount that would have
been payable to such Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1.07_ had such
Stockholder tendered such Stockholders Securityholder Deliveries prior to the
Closing.

 

(b) The Company will give Buyer written notice of any demand for a Dissenter
Payment received by the Company in accordance with DGCL § 262, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company. The Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders,
shall direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any demand for a Dissenter Payment, including all hearings and trials before
the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to DGCL § 262\. Upon request by Buyer,
the Representative shall keep Buyer informed of the status of any such
negotiations and proceedings, and Buyer shall have the right to participate
in such negotiations and proceedings with counsel of its choice, whose fees
and expenses shall be borne by Buyer. Except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, neither the
Company nor the Representative shall make any payment with respect to any
demands for fair value or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(c) Upon a final non-appealable award of any Dissenter Payments by the
Delaware Court of Chancery to any holder of Dissenting Shares,
the Representative shall promptly pay to such holder the amount of such award
and any costs awarded with respect thereto, and neither Buyer nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any Liability therefor. Each of Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified for all Dissenter Payments and any
costs awarded by the Delaware Court of Chancery to the holders of Dissenting
Shares, to the extent paid by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation.

addition the Representative shall deliver to Buyer a calculation, based on the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment calculation delivered by the Company, of the

Securityholder pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_. After delivery of the foregoing
documents and statements, the Buyer and its accountants shall be permitted to
make reasonable inquiries of the Company, the Representative and their
respective accountants, work papers and relevant officers and employees
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment and Closing Consideration arising in the
course of their review thereof.

(b) _Final Calculations_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative (a) a detailed balance sheet of the Company as
of the Closing Date and a statement setting forth Buyers good faith
calculation of (i) the Working Capital and the Working Capital Surplus or
Working Capital Deficit, if any, (ii) the Cash Amount, the outstanding amount
of all Funded Debt as of the Closing Date, and the Transaction Expenses Amount
and (iii) based on the amounts set forth in clauses (a)(i) and (a)(ii), the
Closing Cash Payment (collectively, the " _Closing Statement_ ") and (b) all
records and work papers reasonably necessary to compute and verify the
information set forth in the Closing Statement. After delivery of the Closing
Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, during any period prior to
the Closing Statement becoming final in accordance with this _Section
2.04(b)_), the Representative and its accountants shall be permitted to make
reasonable inquiries of Buyer and the Company and their
respective accountants, work papers and relevant employees, during normal
business hours and on 24 hours advance notice, regarding questions concerning
or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing
Statement, then the Representative shall deliver to Buyer a statement (an "
_Objection Statement_ ") setting forth its disputes or objections (the "
_Objection Disputes_ ") to the Closing Statement and, to the extent
practical, the Representatives proposed resolution of each such Objection
Dispute. If an Objection Statement is not delivered to Buyer within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement by the Representative, then
the Closing Statement as originally received by the Representative shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. If an Objection Statement is
timely delivered, then Buyer and the Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any Objection Disputes, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement,

 



\- 9 -  the Representative and Buyer shall submit each unresolved Objection Dispute
to BDO USA, LLP or such other nationally recognized accounting firm as the
Buyer and the Representative shall agree (the " _Independent Auditor_ ") to
resolve such Objection Disputes. Each of the Representative and the Buyer
agree to sign any reasonable engagement letter proposed by the Independent
Auditor and to advance fifty percent (50%) of any retainer required by the
Independent Auditor in connection therewith (subject to reimbursement by the
non-prevailing party as defined below). The Independent Auditor shall be
instructed to set forth a procedure to provide for prompt resolution of any
unresolved Objection Disputes and, in any event, to make its determination in
respect of such Objection Disputes within thirty (30) days following its
retention. The Independent Auditors determination of such Objection
Disputes shall be final and binding upon the Parties, except in the case of
manifest error, and not subject to review by a court or other tribunal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such determination with respect to any item
reflected in the Objection Statement shall not be any more favorable to Buyer
than is set forth in the Closing Statement or any more favorable to the
Representative than is proposed in the Objection Statement. If any unresolved
Objection Disputes are submitted to the Independent Auditor, then, for
purposes of this _Section 2.04(b)_, Buyer shall be the prevailing party in
such proceeding if a majority of the dollar amount of the unresolved Objection
Disputes are decided by the Independent Auditor in favor of Buyer, and the
Representative shall be the prevailing party if a majority of the dollar
amount of the unresolved Objection Disputes are decided by the Independent
Auditor in favor of the Representative (e.g., if there are $200,000
of disputed items to be determined by the Independent Auditor and the
Independent Auditor determines that Buyers claims prevail with respect to
$125,000 and the Representatives claims prevail with respect to $75,000, then
Buyer would be the prevailing party). The Party that is not the prevailing
party shall pay all of the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor
(including reimbursement to the prevailing party of any portion of any
retainer advanced by such prevailing party). The final Closing Statement,
however determined pursuant to this _Section 2.04(b)_, will be used to
calculate the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, and
the Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt as of the Closing
Date, and the Transaction Expenses Amount, in each case to be used to
determine the final Closing Cash Payment. The process set forth in this
_Section 2.04(b)_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties for
any disputes related to items required to be reflected on the Closing
Statement with respect to the calculation of the Working Capital and the Cash
Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , such process shall not limit any Liability
for breach of any representations or warranties hereunder or limit the
indemnity provided in _Section 10.02(a)(iii)_ for any Funded Debt or
Transaction Expenses that are not included on the Closing Statement.

 

(ii) If after the final determination pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)(i)_, the
final Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash
Payment, then (x) Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination thereof) pay to the Representative
(on behalf of the Securityholders) such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Representative, and, subject to _Sections 1.09_ and _13.15_ , the
Representative shall promptly thereafter deliver to each Securityholder
such Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of such amount, and (y) the Buyer
and the Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination thereof) deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Amount (and
all earnings and interest thereon) to the Representative on behalf of the
Securityholders, and thereafter, subject to _Sections 1.09_ and _13.15_ , the
Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder such Securityholders
Pro Rata Percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (and all earnings and
interest thereon).

 



\- 10 - (iii) If after the final determination pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)(i)_, the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment is greater than the final Closing Cash
Payment, then the Buyer and the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination thereof) deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent (A) to release to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer, the
lesser of (x) the amount by which the Estimated Closing Cash Payment exceeds
the final Closing Cash Payment and (y) the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
and the Indemnification Escrow Amount (and all earnings and interest on each
such amount); provided however, that funds shall only be released from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to this subsection to the extent the
Adjustment Escrow Amount (and all earnings and interest thereon) is less than
the amount by which the Estimated Closing Cash Payment exceeds the
final Closing Cash Payment, and (B) after such payment, to release to the
Representative, any remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any remaining
earnings and interest thereon) (on behalf of the Securityholders). Promptly
after any such distribution to the Representative, subject to _Sections 1.09_
and _13.15_ , the Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder such
Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of such amount. Once the Closing
Statement has been delivered by Buyer, the Buyer and the Representative shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of such delivery)
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the
Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, any portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount (and all earnings and interest thereon) in excess of
the amount (if any) claimed to be owed to Buyer in the Closing Statement.
Promptly after any such release to the Representative, subject to _Sections
1.09_ and _13.15_ , the Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder
such Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of such amount.

 

2.05 _Preparation of Closing Statement; Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Preparation of Closing Statement_. The calculation of the Estimated
Closing Cash Payment and the estimated balance sheet upon which such
calculation was based, the Closing Statement (and all calculations of Working
Capital, Working Capital Surplus Amount (if any), Working Capital Deficit
Amount (if any), and the Cash Amount), shall be prepared and calculated in
accordance with GAAP, using the same accounting methods, policies, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications and estimation methodologies,
in each case as were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements as at or for the period ended December 31, 2014, except as noted
in _Schedule 2.05(a)_, except that the same shall (i) not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist immediately prior to the Closing and shall exclude
the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing.
For purposes of determining the amount of inventory included in current
assets for purposes of calculating the Working Capital, the parties recognize
and agree that the Buyer shall conduct a physical count of inventory within
five (5) days after the Closing and the Representative (or its designees)
shall be given prior written notice of such count and shall be entitled to be
present for such count.

 



\- 11 - (b) _Cooperation_. Following the Closing until the final resolution of any
Objection Disputes, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation,
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, consultants,
accountants and agents to (i) cooperate reasonably with the Representative and
its accountants in connection with its review of the Closing Statement and
the preparation of the Objection Statement, if any (including by providing the
Representative with reasonable access to the employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries who are knowledgeable about the information
contained in, and the preparation of, the Closing Statement during normal
business hours and upon 24 hours advance notice) and (ii) provide any books,
records and other information reasonably requested by the Representative and
its accountants in connection therewith or in connection with resolving any
Objection Dispute, including during the period while any unresolved Objection
Disputes are being reviewed by the Independent Auditor and until a final
determination has been issued by the Independent Auditor.

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than unfunded Liabilities
under the Companys 401(k) plan for contributions for the current pay period.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Section 4.14(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
there has been no material violation of or material failure to comply with

Plans, the assets of any such plans or of any related trust or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, the plan administrator or any fiduciary of the
Employee Benefit Plans with respect to such plans (other than routine benefit
claims). To the Companys Knowledge, no Employee Benefit Plan is under audit
or investigation by the IRS, DOL, or any other Governmental Authority and no
such completed audit, if any, has resulted in the imposition of a material
Tax, interest, or penalty.

 



\- 25 - (h) Except as set forth on _Section 4.14(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, each

ERISA Affiliate that is a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code and each plan sponsor or administrator has complied

continuation and coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Part 6 of Title I

service providers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective Predecessors), after
termination of employment or other service other than the rights that may be
provided by Law.

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of ERISA or the Code and
there has not been a breach of any duty imposed on "fiduciaries" that are the

conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any payment becoming due
to any service provider; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable to any
service provider including under any Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits (other
than options disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules).

not give rise to any Liability for termination of any agreements related to
any Employee Benefit Plan.

will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G of the Code.

(n) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code

Returns that are required to be filed by them (taking into account any
extensions of time to file that have been duly perfected) and all such Tax
Returns are true and correct in all material respects. All Taxes due and owing
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully paid in compliance
with applicable Laws, and the provision for Taxes on the Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet is sufficient in accordance with GAAP for all accrued and
unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not yet payable as
of the date thereof. All Taxes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
party have been fully paid in compliance with applicable Laws, or to the

or foreign income Tax law), as transferee or successor, or by contract or
otherwise (other than with respect to the consolidated returns including only
the Company and its Subsidiaries and other than obligations under credit
agreements, lease agreements or other commercial agreements entered into in
the ordinary course of business containing customary Tax allocation or gross-
up provisions). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been the
subject of any audit or other examination of Taxes by the Taxing Authorities

Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been asserted or assessed
by any Taxing Authority. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived in writing any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes payable by
any of them, which waiver is currently in effect. There are no Liens for Taxes
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any agreement that would require the Company or such Subsidiary to make any
payment that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude an
item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (a) change in method
of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b)

Subsidiaries

 



\- 27 -  has been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return

Securityholder Releasors, or any of them, ever had or may have through and
including the Closing Date, other than any obligations of the Buyer Releasees

harmless for such Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of all Income Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

which is a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for

Representative is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.01_.

 

7.05 _Cooperation on Income Tax Matters_. Buyer shall provide to the
Representative, and the Representative shall provide to Buyer, such material
documents and other relevant information, without charge and in a timely

imposed on the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that
such documents or information are not privileged communications. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the other Partys request,
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Buyer agrees to retain all books and
records with respect to Income Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in accordance with
_Section 6.03_ hereof, and to abide by all record retention arrangements
entered into with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto.

 

7.06 _Income Tax Refunds and Credits_. Except to the extent reflected as an
asset in the calculation of Working Capital on the Closing Statement, all
refunds of Income Taxes (including

refunds resulting from the carryforward or carryback of a net operating loss

fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto, and such amounts shall
not be subject to setoff hereunder for any amounts due from the
Securityholders hereunder.

receipt by such Party of notice of any pending or threatened Tax liabilities
of the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. The Representative (on behalf
of the Securityholders) will have the right, at its expense, to represent the
interests of the Company and any Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or
administrative or court action for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and to employ
counsel of its choice, and the parties agree to cooperate in the defense of
any claim in such action, provided that the Representative shall not enter
into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax audit or
administrative or court action that adversely affects or may adversely affect
the Tax position of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending after the Closing Date, including the
portion of any Straddle Period beginning on or after the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Representative will have the right to
participate in representing the interests of the Company (or the Surviving
Corporation) and any of its Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or administrative
or court action for any Straddle Period if and to the extent that such period
includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and to employ counsel of its choice at
its expense. Buyer, the Company and the Representative agree to cooperate in
the defense of any claim in such action. To the extent that the procedures
described in _ARTICLE X_ are inconsistent with those set forth in this

in this Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal.

(c) With respect to the matters described in  _Section 10.02(a)(i)_, no
Securityholder will have any Liability with respect to such matters until the

point the Securityholders will only be obligated to indemnify Buyer
Indemnitees from and against all such indemnifiable Losses in excess of the

event exceed the amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Securityholder.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) no
Securityholder shall have any Liability in excess of its Pro Rata Percentage
of any Loss recoverable under _Section 10.02(a)_ or _ARTICLE VII_ (except as

Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (in which
case the Representative is authorized to appropriately adjust future
distributions from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to reduce the
amount otherwise distributable to such breaching Securityholder), provided
however, that if any Securityholder breaches the representation made by such
Securityholder in _Section 4.04_, then the Buyer shall be permitted to seek
recovery for all Losses resulting therefrom from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, even if such amount exceeds such breaching Securityholders Pro Rata
Percentage of the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

 



\- 40 - 10.03 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Securityholders_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _ARTICLE X_ , Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders, their respective Affiliates,
and their respective successors and assigns (the " _Securityholder
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any Losses that any Securityholder Indemnitee
may incur (provided that an indemnification claim with respect to such
Losses is made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ prior to the end of any
applicable survival period) relating to or caused by (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or Merger Sub in

excess of the Deductible, after which point Buyer will be obligated to

(a) If any third party notifies any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of a
matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under
_ARTICLE VII_ or this _ARTICLE X_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, describing the claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis of the claim;
_provided,_ that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
limit the indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

 



\- 41 - (b) Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Partys expense, and at its
option will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of
the defense against a Third Party Claim if (1) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the claim seeks an injunction,
specific performance or any other equitable or non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Party; (3) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse
determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would be materially
detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnified Partys reputation or
future business prospects; (4) the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (5) the Indemnifying Party
fails to prosecute or defend such claim in a commercially reasonable manner;
or (6) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with
a breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Company or any
Securityholder contained in this Agreement, the Losses sought are less than
the Deductible or exceed the Cap, and the claim does not relate to a breach
of a Fundamental Representations or allegation of Fraud.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following receipt by Buyer of (A) notice of a Third
Party Claim, each Party shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, retain documents that are then within such Persons possession or control
and reasonably related to such Third Party Claim for a period of time that the
Parties reasonably determines, in consultation with each other, after taking
into account all relevant facts and circumstances related to the Third Party
Claim that is the subject of such notice, or (B) a written notice by the
Representative of a demand or inquiry by a Governmental Authority, or subpoena
or other legal process served by any Person, relating to the Company, each
Party shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, retain
documents that are then within such Persons possession or control and
reasonably related to such information, demand or inquiry or such subpoena or
other legal process for the time period that the Parties reasonably
determine, in consultation with each other, after taking into account all
relevant facts and circumstances related to such information, demand or
inquiry.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim and
the indemnifiable Losses previously incurred or suffered by the Indemnified
Party do not, in the aggregate, exceed the Deductible, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days of
receipt of a written request from the Indemnifying Party that includes
reasonable supporting documentation, reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the

 



\- 42 -  defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
amounts that are reimbursed pursuant to this sentence shall constitute Losses
of the Indemnified Party and shall thereafter count against the Deductible
for the purposes of determining indemnifiable Losses in excess of the
Deductible pursuant to _Section 10.02(c)._

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Representative and the Securityholders acknowledge and agree that
the provisions hereof dealing with Third Party Claims shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the RandW Policy and the rights of the insurer
thereunder to, among other things, consent to any settlement thereof.

 

10.05 _Determination of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss recoverable under _ARTICLE VII_ and this _ARTICLE
X_ (i) shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds (including the proceeds of
the RandW Policy) received with respect to such Losses (after deducting from
such insurance proceeds any expenses incurred to obtain such proceeds) and
(ii) without limitation to _Section 13.03_, shall not include any costs and
expenses of investigation, assertion, dispute, enforcement, defense or
resolution, including attorneys, accountants and other professionals fees,
disbursements and expenses, to the extent incurred in connection with any
claim or dispute among the Parties as to whether a Securityholder Indemnitee,
on the one hand, or a Buyer Indemnitee, on the other hand, is entitled to
indemnification under _ARTICLE VII_ or this _ARTICLE X_ for any particular
Loss or Losses or to specific enforcement under _Section 13.10_, except as
provided in _Section 13.03_ (for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in
this clause (ii) shall not apply with respect to costs and expenses relating
to the investigation, assertion, dispute, enforcement, defense or resolution
in respect of any Third Party Claim, including reasonable attorneys,
accountants and other professionals fees, disbursements and expenses
in respect of any Third Party Claim). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 10.05(a)_ shall be interpreted to limit the Buyers ability to
recover for any Loss under the RandW Policy.

 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same
extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that any insurance recovery is received by any
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount of such recovery
(net of any related deductible and any expenses to obtain such proceeds) shall
be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party that made or directed such
indemnification payments to such Indemnified Party.

10.06 _Payment_. In the event a claim or any Proceeding for indemnification
under this _ARTICLE X_ has been finally determined, the amount of such final
determination shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
on demand in immediately available funds, subject to _Section 10.10_. A claim
or Proceeding, and the liability for and amount of damages therefor, shall be
deemed to be "finally determined" for purposes of this _ARTICLE X_ when the
Parties have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final
nonappealable judgment, order or ruling by a Governmental Authority has been
entered into with respect to such claim or Proceeding.

10.07 _Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge or Waiver_. The
right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based upon breach
of representations,

 



\- 43 -  warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant, agreement or obligation, will
not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
and obligations.

10.08 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the indemnification provisions in
this _ARTICLE X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties and
their Affiliates with respect to any claim related to or arising from this
Agreement, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the performance by
the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Buyer agrees that, once the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of
_Section 10.02(a)(i)_ recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees has reached the
Cap, the only source of recovery and recourse for any claims that any Buyer
Indemnitee may have related to or arising from _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ shall be
from the recovery of amounts under the RandW Policy (subject to the terms and
limitations of the RandW Policy), except with respect to (i) the breach of any
of the Fundamental Representations made by the Company or any Securityholder
(provided that each Securityholder shall only be responsible for breaches of
its own Fundamental Representations, and not for any breach by any other
Securityholder, except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.02(f)_ herein
with respect to the Indemnification Escrow Amount) and (ii) Fraud of the
Company or such Securityholder.

attached hereto) and other documents delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto
or thereto, contain the entire understanding of the Parties in respect of
their subject matter and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
(oral or written) between the Parties with respect to such subject
matter, other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule,
Exhibits and Schedules constitute a part hereof as though set forth in full
herein.

 

13.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties shall pay
their own fees and expenses, including their own counsel fees, incurred in
connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of
litigation with respect to this Agreement (other than a Third Party Claim),

litigation, including any appeal therefrom.

 

13.04 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
supplemented, canceled or discharged, except by written instrument executed
by Buyer and the

 



\- 57 -  Company and the Representative. No failure to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any
other provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing
between the Parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations
or other acts hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an
extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other
acts.

13.05 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. The rights and obligations of
this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing expressed or implied
herein or therein shall be construed to give any other Person any legal or
equitable rights hereunder. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights
and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by the Parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , that
Buyer and Merger Sub (or the Surviving Corporation after Closing) may,
without the consent of any other Party, assign their rights hereunder for
collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates.

 

13.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile and electronically transmitted
portable document format (pdf) signature pages), each of which shall be an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

13.07 _Interpretation; Schedules_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to the Preamble or Recitals or an Article, Section, clause, Schedule or
Exhibit, such reference shall be deemed to be to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Words of one gender shall be held to include the other
gender as the context requires. The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" or
"hereby" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any specific section. The headings contained herein and on
the Schedules are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or the Schedules. Unless
otherwise specified herein, references to any statute, listing rule, rule,
standard, regulation or other law include a reference to the corresponding
rules and regulations and each of them as amended, modified, supplemented,
consolidated, replaced or rewritten from time to time. References to any
section of any statute, listing rule, rule, standard, regulation or other law
include any successor to such section. References to any Contract (including
this Agreement) or organizational document are to the Contract or
organizational document as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from
time to time, unless otherwise stated. References to any Person include such
Persons predecessors or successors, whether by merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, reorganization or otherwise, and permitted assigns. Each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent
significance. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, if any Party
hereto (or any Securityholder) has breached any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party (or
such Securityholder) has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the
fact that the Party (or such Securityholder) is in breach of the 

 



\- 58 -  first representation, warranty or covenant. Any information set forth in one
section of the Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to other sections
of the Disclosure Schedule to which its relevance is apparent from the face
of such disclosure (notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-
reference thereto). The information contained in the Schedules hereto is
disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of
any agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined in the
Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings set forth herein.

13.08 _Governing Law; Interpretation_. This Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed for all purposes by the internal substantive
Laws of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be wholly performed
within Delaware.

 

13.09 _Forum Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Any Proceeding against Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, any of the
Securityholders, the Surviving Corporation or the Representative or arising
out of, or with respect to, this Agreement or any judgment entered by any
court in respect thereof shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal
courts located in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (the "
_Designated Courts_ "), and the Parties hereto accept the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Designated Courts for the purpose of any Proceeding. Each
Party and each Securityholder agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such Party or the
Representative (on behalf of such Securityholder) in accordance with _Section
13.01_ shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding brought against such Party or Securityholder in any such court.
Buyer and Merger Sub hereby designate the individual listed in _Section
13.01(a)_ to whom notice may be given on behalf of Buyer and Merger Sub as
their true and lawful agent upon whom may be served any lawful process in any
action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the Representative or
any Securityholder. Each Securityholder and the Representative hereby
designate the individual listed in _Section 13.01(b)_ to whom notice may be
given on behalf of the Representative and each Securityholder as their true
and lawful agent upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action,
suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) In addition, each Party and each Securityholder hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any Designated Court or any judgment entered by
any of the Designated Courts and hereby further irrevocably waives any claim
that any Proceedings brought in the Designated Courts has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
OUT OF, OR WITH RESPECT TO, THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

 



\- 59 -  AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS _SECTION 13.09_. EITHER PARTY
MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY.

13.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agrees that this Agreement
is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms and that Buyer, the Company and the Securityholders would be irreparably
harmed if any of the provisions of the Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other
remedy to which a Party may be entitled at Law, a Party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief without the posting of any bond or other undertaking to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions hereof. Each Party and each Securityholder further waives any
defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate in any action or Proceeding for
specific performance or injunctive relief hereunder.

 

13.11 _Arm s Length Negotiations; Drafting_. Each Party herein expressly
represents and warrants to the other Parties that before executing this
Agreement, said Party has fully informed itself of the terms, contents,
conditions and effects of this Agreement; said Party has relied solely and
completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; said Party has
had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of counsel before
executing this Agreement, which is the result of arms length negotiations
conducted by and among the Parties and their respective counsel. This
Agreement shall be deemed drafted jointly by the Parties and nothing shall be
construed against one Party or another as the drafting Party.

13.12 _Time_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred
to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

13.13 _Made Available_. The phrase "made available to Buyer" or similar

established by the Company and/or its agents (the " _Data Room_ ") or
delivered to Buyer or its accountants, attorneys or other designated agents.

13.14  _Confidentiality; Publicity_. Except as may be required by Law, or as
otherwise permitted or expressly contemplated herein, no Party or its
respective Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives shall disclose to
any third party the existence of this Agreement or the subject matter or
terms hereof without the prior consent of the other Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Party and their Affiliates shall be permitted (a) to
disclose such information to their attorneys, advisors, representatives,
members or investors,

 



\- 60 -  (b) to disclose and use such information solely in connection with enforcing
their rights and fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document and (c) issue press releases announcing the
closing of the transaction, provided that the issuing Party shall provide the
other Party with a draft of such press release prior to issuance and provide
such other Party with the opportunity to review and comment on such draft.
Except as contemplated by clause (c) above, no press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
any other announcement or communication to the employees, customers
or suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by
the Company, any Securityholder or the Representative without the approval of
the Buyer, unless required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case the Buyer and the Representative shall have the right to review
such press release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance,
distribution or publication (subject to the last sentence of this Section).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall (x) restrict
the ability of Peak Rock Capital LLC and its Affiliates (the " _Peak Rock
Entities_ ") from providing (i) the financial results achieved by the Peak
Rock Entities with respect to their beneficial interest in the Company and
its Subsidiaries to their respective investors, potential investors, providers
of financing and other third parties in the ordinary course of their business
or (ii) a description of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including their
financial performance, and the Peak Rock Entities investment and role
therein), and such other information as the Peak Rock Entities provide to
third parties in the ordinary course of business, to the current or
prospective limited partners, financing sources or other business associates
of the Peak Rock Entities and their respective advisors in the ordinary course
of business, except in each case as otherwise required by Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Buyer and/or its Affiliates will make certain securities filings
required in connection with the signing and Closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby, issue a press release in connection therewith, and shall
implement a communications plan with employees, customers and suppliers of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, and that no consent of
any Party or other Person shall be required hereunder in connection with any
such actions, provided that Buyer shall provide the Representative with a
draft of the Form 8-K and initial press release prior to filing or issuance as
applicable and provide the Representative with the opportunity to review
and comment on such drafts, and if the Closing occurs and Buyer has not
received any such comments from Representative, then Representative shall be
deemed to have waived its right to review such drafts.

 

13.15 _Designation of the Representative_.

 

(a) _Designation_. HC Capital Holdings 313A, LLC (the " _Representative_ ") is
hereby designated to serve as the representative of the Securityholders with
respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed
by the Representative.

 

(b) _Authority_. The Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed as the
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for each of the Securityholders for all
purposes of this Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection
herewith (including the full power and authority on such Persons behalf (i)
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) to pay expenses
incurred by such Person or the Representative in connection with the marketing
of the Company, the evaluation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the negotiation and performance of this Agreement and any other
agreement entered into in connection herewith (whether incurred on or after
the date hereof), (iii) to disburse any funds

 



\- 61 -  received hereunder to each other Securityholder, (iv) to endorse and deliver
any certificates or instruments representing the shares of Common Stock or the
Options and execute such further agreements or instruments of assignment as
Buyer shall reasonably request or which the Representative shall consider
necessary or proper to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all of which shall have the effect of binding the Securityholders
as if such Securityholder had personally executed such agreement or
instrument, (v) to resolve any adjustments or issues relating to any component
of the Closing Cash Payment, (vi) to receive notices, service of process
and other deliverables hereunder on behalf of such Person, (vii) to execute
and deliver on behalf of such Person any amendment or waiver hereto or to any
other agreement contemplated hereunder, (viii) to take all other actions to be
taken by or on behalf of such Person in connection herewith, (ix) to dispute,
compromise, settle and pay any claims made in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereunder, (x) to retain legal and other
professional advisors on behalf of, and at the expense of the Securityholders
in connection with its actions hereunder, (xi) to dispense funds from the
Holdback to the Securityholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to
retain from such funds an amount sufficient to satisfy the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses or other amounts incurred or payable by the Representative in
fulfilling its obligations hereunder, (xii) to make any calculations required
under this Agreement (including calculations with respect to the distribution
of the Merger Consideration or any Future Distribution Amounts or each
Securityholders Pro Rata Percentage of any indemnification obligation), and
(xiii) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Person or the Securityholders are permitted or required to do or exercise
under this Agreement. Such agency, proxy and attorney-in-fact and all
authority granted hereunder are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Person. If, after the execution of this Agreement, any Securityholder dies,
dissolves or liquidates or becomes incapacitated or incompetent, then the
Representative is nevertheless authorized, empowered and directed to act in
accordance with this Agreement as if that death, dissolution, liquidation,
incapacity or incompetency had not occurred and regardless of notice thereof.
All decisions and actions by the Representative shall be binding upon all of
the Securityholders, and no Securityholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 

(c) _Holdback_. The Holdback shall be withheld and paid directly to an account
maintained by the Representative (or a financial institution selected by the
Representative) as a fund for the fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, any legal fees and expenses) of the Representative incurred in
connection with the marketing of the Company, this Agreement, the evaluation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other actions taken by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, with any balance of the Holdback
not utilized for such purposes to be returned to the Securityholders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage. In the event that the Holdback
shall be insufficient to satisfy the fees and expenses and other amounts
payable by or on behalf of the Representative, the Representative shall be
entitled to recover any remaining expenses directly from the Securityholders.
The Representative shall not have any obligation to personally advance funds
in connection with the performance of any duties under this Agreement.

 

(d) _Authority; Indemnification_. Buyer, Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the Representative, on
behalf of the

 



\- 62 -  Securityholders, pursuant to _Section 13.15(b)_ (each, an " _Authorized
Action_ "), and each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Securityholder
as fully as if such Person had taken such Authorized Action. Buyer agrees
that the Representative, solely in its capacity as the Representative, shall
have no Liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action, except to the extent
that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or bad faith. Each Securityholder
severally, for itself only and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless
the Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by the Representative in connection with any action, suit or
Proceeding to which the Representative is made a party by reason of the fact
it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

(e) _Duties of the Representative_. The Representative hereby accepts its
obligations under this Agreement. The Representative shall have only the
duties expressly stated in this Agreement, and shall have no other duty,
express or implied. The Representative is not, by virtue of serving
as Representative, a fiduciary of the Securityholders or any other Person.
The Representative, in its capacity as such, has no personal responsibility or
Liability for any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company.

 

(f) _Exculpation_. The Representative shall not be liable to any
Securityholder for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by
it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith,
except that the Representative shall not be relieved of any Liability imposed
by Law for fraud or bad faith. The Representative shall not be liable to
the Securityholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by
the Representative in good faith, and, if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole
recourse of any Person to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Securityholders any payment in excess of the amount to
which they are determined to have been entitled. The Representative shall not
be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.
Neither the Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any
Liability to any Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of
the Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except
for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith.

 

(g) _Letter of Transmittal_. Any Securityholder that executes and delivers a
Letter of Transmittal pursuant to _Section 1.08_ will become a Party to this
Agreement and shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement applicable to it as a Securityholder or as a Party hereunder.

 

(h) _No Fees to or Compensation of the Representative_. The Representative
shall not be entitled to and shall not charge or collect from the
Securityholders or any other Person any fees or other compensation for its
services as the Representative under this Agreement. The Representative,
however, shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Securityholders (based on
their Pro Rata Percentage of such expenses) for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with its services as the Representative under
this Agreement.

 

(i) _Replacement of the Representative_. If the Representative resigns or is
otherwise unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, then the
Securityholders that held a majority of the shares of voting Common Stock
outstanding on the date hereof will appoint a new Person to serve as the
Representative, subject to the Buyers advance written approval of such
replacement, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Until such appointment
is effective, Buyer will be entitled to rely on the actions and statements of
the previous Representative.

 



\- 63 - 13.16 _Company Representation_. Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees
and Affiliates, that McDermott Will and Emery LLP may serve as counsel to each
and any of the Securityholders and their respective Affiliates (individually
and collectively, the " _Securityholder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, McDermott Will and Emery
LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Representative, the
Securityholder Group (or any member of the Securityholder Group) or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
Representative, the Company or the Securityholder Group (or any member of the
Securityholder Group) in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any
continued representation of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and
each of the Parties consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each of such Parties shall cause its Affiliates to
consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Buyer and Merger Sub further agree that, as to
all communications among McDermott Will and Emery LLP, the Representative, the
Company and/or any Securityholder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence (and the right to waive or assert such
privilege) belongs to the Representative and, if applicable, the
Securityholders and may be controlled by the Representative and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Parties agree that McDermott Will and Emery LLP shall not,
without the consent of the Representative, be required to disclose to Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, any advice given in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
