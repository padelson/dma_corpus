Chauchat Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("US Parent") and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, formed for the purpose of entering into
this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby;  
WHEREAS, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has

and to make a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the Company with
respect thereto;   WHEREAS, the Special Committee (i) has determined that it

State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with, the DGCL and the DLLCA. The term "Effective Time" means the date and

of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed by the parties
hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger).   SECTION 1.03 Effect of
the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, without further act or deed, all the property, rights,
immunities, privileges, powers, franchises and licenses of the Company and

At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be   2  8 amended so
as to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A hereto, and as so
amended shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and as provided by the DGCL.   (b) By-laws. At the Effective Time, the By-
laws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B
hereto, and as so amended shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by
the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 1.05 Directors and Officers.   (a) Directors. From
and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Company shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be, in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, the DGCL and this
Agreement.   (b) Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers

of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, the DGCL and
this Agreement.   SECTION 1.06 Additional Actions. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts
are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement,
the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to

necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation
and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the
Company to take any and all such action.   SECTION 1.07 Change in
Structure. Parent may, at any time prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company, change the method of effecting
the combination with the Company to substitute a direct or indirect Delaware
corporate subsidiary of Parent for Chauchat L.L.C., in which case (i) all
references to Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such
subsidiary and all references to Merger Sub being a limited liability company
shall be deemed to refer to Merger Sub being a corporation, (ii) all
references to Merger Sub Units shall be deemed to refer to the common stock
of such subsidiary, and (iii) all references to the DLLCA shall
be disregarded; provided, that no such change shall alter or change in any
way the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock or the
holders of Options or Restricted Shares or impede or delay consummation of
the Merger.   3  9  Article II  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES; DEPOSIT;  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES   SECTION 2.01 Effect on
Capital Stock and LLC Interests. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Common
Shares or any limited liability company interests of Merger Sub (the "Merger
Sub Units"):   (a) Cancellation of Merger Sub Units. All of the Merger
Sub Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without any
consideration payable therefor.   (b) Cancellation of Company Owned Stock.
All shares of Company Common Stock and Class A Common Stock (if any) that are
held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (other than Company Common Shares owned, directly or indirectly, in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or custodial capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties
("Fiduciary Shares") and other than any Company Common Shares held in respect
of a debt previously contracted) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist
without any consideration payable therefor.   (c) Conversion of Company
Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares, if
applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock referred to in Section
2.01(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation $35.00 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") without interest
thereon upon surrender of the certificate previously representing such share
of Company Common Stock as provided in Section 2.02(c). As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Dissenting Shares,
if applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock referred to in Section
2.01(b)) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such share of Company
Common Stock (other than Certificates representing (i) Dissenting Shares, if
applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock referred to in Section
2.01(b)) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with
this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate.   (d) Conversion of
Class A Common Stock. Each share of Class A Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Class A Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall be
converted into (as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article II) and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
Stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation Common Stock"), and all such shares of Class A Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such share   4  10 of Class A
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive a certificate representing the Surviving Corporation Common
Stock into which their shares of Class A Common Stock have been converted in
the Merger as provided in this Section 2.01(d).   SECTION 2.02. Exchange
Procedures. (a) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall (except as specifically set
forth in Section 2.01 and subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting
Shares) represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest.   (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall or
shall cause Merger Sub to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (it being understood
that an affiliate of Parent or the Company is reasonably satisfactory to the
Company) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the
Certificates, funds in the aggregate amount to be paid pursuant to this
Article II in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any
cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
Exchange Fund.   (c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall send or cause to be sent to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares that are not to
be canceled in exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c))
immediately prior to the Effective Time transmittal materials for use in
exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause any check in respect of the Merger Consideration
(together with any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled in accordance with this Article II upon surrender of such
Certificate) which such person shall be entitled to receive to be delivered
to such stockholder upon delivery to the Paying Agent of Certificates
formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock (or indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, if
any of such Certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by
such stockholder. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest will be paid on
any such cash to be paid pursuant to this Article II upon such delivery. The
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Certificates such
amounts (if any) as the Surviving Corporation determines are required to be
deducted or withheld under the Code, or any provision of United States, state
or local tax law or any foreign tax law applicable as a result of the
residence, location, domicile or other facts relating to the stockholder. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Certificates.   (d) Subject to
Section 2.04, at the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other
than to   5  11 receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to
the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective
Time and the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any
shares of the Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 2.02 together with any dividends or other distributions
to which the holder becomes entitled in accordance with this Article II upon
the surrender of such Certificates.   (e) Any funds (including any interest
with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and
that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.
Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock formerly held by such stockholder as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f) In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement and
any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled
in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such
Certificate.   (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available
to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02 to pay for shares of
Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand.   (h) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
provided, that in the case of any losses incurred in the Exchange Fund as a
result of such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to take all actions necessary (including by depositing
additional cash) to ensure that   6  12 the Exchange Fund includes cash
sufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
to pay the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in
accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of Certificates. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to or
at the direction of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.03. Company Stock
Options; Company Restricted Stock; Plans.   (a) Stock Options. At the
Effective Time, each option (and any stock appreciation rights associated
therewith) to purchase a share of Company Common Stock (an "Option" and,
collectively, the "Options") outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective
Time granted pursuant to the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended), the
Stock Incentive Plan (as amended), the California Community Bancshares
Corporation 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Continental Pacific Bank 1990 Amended
Stock Option Plan, the SierraWest Bancorp 1996 Stock Option Plan (as
amended), the Sierra Tahoe Bancorp 1988 Stock Option Plan (as amended) and
any other equity-based plans or agreements of or with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries providing for the granting of options with respect to
Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") shall
be canceled, whether or not then exercisable or vested, and shall represent
the right to receive the following consideration in settlement thereof. Each
Option shall vest as a result of the Merger and shall become exercisable at
or immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation (or any
trust that is adopted in connection with any such Company Stock Option Plan)
shall pay to the holder of any Option the excess (rounded to the nearest
$0.01), if any, of the Merger Consideration over such Option\'s exercise
price (the "Option Spread") as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.
All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be reduced by
all applicable withholding taxes and other similar charges.   (b)
Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock (a
"Restricted Share" and, collectively, the "Restricted Shares") outstanding as
of the Effective Time issued pursuant to a Company Stock Option Plan, the
Incentive Plan for Key Executives (as amended) or any other equity-based
plans or agreements of or with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
providing for the granting of restricted stock awards with respect to Company
Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Equity Plans" and together with the
Company Stock Option Plans, the "Company Stock Plans"), to the extent not
already vested, shall vest and shall represent the right to receive
the following consideration in settlement thereof. The Surviving Corporation
(or any trust that is adopted in connection with any such Company Equity
Plan) shall pay to the holder of a Restricted Share the Merger Consideration
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. All payments made pursuant
to this Section 2.03(b) shall be reduced by all applicable withholding taxes
and other similar charges.   (c) As of the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, in consultation with Parent, to
remove, or cause to be removed from each and every plan, program, agreement
or arrangement any right of any participant thereunder to invest in, or
receive a distribution in, Company Common Stock.   SECTION 2.04. Shares of
Dissenting Stockholders. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares (the "Dissenting Shares") of Company Common   7 
13 Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that
are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who properly demands appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost,
his or her right to appraisal under the DGCL, and instead shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of Section
262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
each share of such holder\'s Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, in accordance
with Section 2.01 (together with any dividends or other distributions to
which holders of Certificates become entitled in accordance with this Article
II upon the surrender of such Certificates).   (b) The Company shall give
Merger Sub and Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices or demands (or
withdrawals of notices or demands) for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without prior written
consent of Merger Sub and Parent, make any payments, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, with respect to any such demands.   (c)
Dissenting Shares, if any, after payments of fair value in respect thereof
have been made to the holders thereof pursuant to the DGCL, shall be
canceled.   SECTION 2.05. Adjustment of Merger Consideration. In the
event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares of a different class as a
result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other number or amount
which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
appropriately adjusted.   SECTION 2.06. Disclosure Schedules. (a) Prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the
Company, a schedule (in the case of the Company, the "Company Disclosure
Schedule," and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule") setting forth, among other things, in each case with respect to
specified sections of this Agreement, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
of such party\'s representations or warranties contained in Article III, in
the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub,
or to one or more of such party\'s covenants contained in Article V;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth in a Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by Section 2.06(b), and (ii) the
mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a  
8  14 representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively. Matters disclosed
in any particular section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in any other section with respect to which such matter is
relevant so long as the relevance of such disclosure is readily apparent.  
(b) No representation of the Company contained in Article III (other than
Section 3.02, which shall be true in all meaningful respects, and Section
3.10(a)) or of Parent or Merger Sub contained in Article IV shall be deemed
untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no party hereto
shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for any purpose
under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence
or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance
or event, individually or when taken together with all other facts,
circumstances or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties
contained in Article III, in the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the
case of Parent or Merger Sub, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively.
For all purposes of determining whether any facts or events contravening a
representation or warranty contained herein constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, representations and warranties
contained in Article III (other than Section 3.10(a)) or IV shall be read
without regard to any reference to materiality or to Material Adverse Effect
set forth therein.   Article III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

together as a single class (the "Company Stockholder Approval").   SECTION

which recommendation shall be contained in the Proxy Statement (as defined
below); provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) may withdraw, modify or
change its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) determines in good faith, following consultation with its outside
counsel as to legal matters, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement, and shall take all other action reasonably necessary
or advisable to secure the vote or consent of such holders required by the

provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting
of the stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted
for adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if

relating to the Company Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") with the SEC and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC (after
providing Parent and Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon) and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to
all such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC staff. The Company shall
notify Parent and Merger Sub promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent and Merger
Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement (other than portions relating to
Parent or Merger Sub) to comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the Proxy Statement and the   24  30 solicitation of proxies
for the Company Meeting (including any requirement to amend or supplement the
Proxy Statement). Merger Sub and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub will cause
those portions of the Proxy Statement relating to Parent and Merger Sub to

furnish to the other such information relating to it and its affiliates and
the transactions contemplated hereby and such further and
supplemental information as may be reasonably requested by the other party
and shall promptly notify the other party of any change in such information.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain (i) any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii)
any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under
which such statement is made, will be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or which will omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and

such amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without providing Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon.   (b) Subject to Section 6.01(a) hereof and
without limiting its rights under Section 8.01(h) hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company\'s Board of

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which
are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to comply fully with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Entities; provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to agree
to any Burdensome Condition (as defined below). Parent, the Company and
Merger Sub shall, to the extent practicable, consult each other on, in each
case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all
the information relating to the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. For   25 
31 purposes of this Agreement, "Burdensome Condition" means any
conditions, restrictions or requirements which the Board of Directors of
Parent reasonably determines would, individually or in the aggregate, (a)
reduce the benefits of the Merger to such a degree that Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements
been known at the date hereof or (b) have, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a material and adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time.   (d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, upon
request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves,
their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 6.03. Access to Information; Confidentiality.
(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide to Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, agents and other representatives, collectively,
"Representatives") (i) reasonable access, during normal business hours and in
a manner so as to not unduly interfere with the Company\'s business, to all
properties, offices and other facilities, information, books, records and
documents which Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request regarding the
business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, employees and other
aspects of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) reasonable access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees and agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.   (b) Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the entity in control or possession of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree, or any binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. In any such event the parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements to the extent possible in the circumstances.   (c)
No investigation by any party, whether prior to the execution of this
Agreement or pursuant to this Section 6.03, shall affect any representation
or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto.   (d) For a period of two years from the
date hereof, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives, to keep confidential any and all Confidential
Information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement. "Confidential Information" means any
information furnished pursuant to this Agreement, regardless of the form in
which such information is communicated or maintained, and all notes, reports,
analyses, compilations, studies, files or other documents or material,
whether prepared by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or others, which are
based on, contain or otherwise reflect such information; provided, that
"Confidential Information" does not include information that (i) is or
becomes available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure in
breach of this Section 6.03, (ii) was available, or has become available, to
Parent,   26  32 Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, on
a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its
Representatives; provided, that such source was not, to the Knowledge of
Parent or Merger Sub or such Representatives, prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation owed to the
Company, or (iii) Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives independently developed without reference to Confidential
Information.   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that any party to this Agreement is legally required
pursuant to applicable law or regulation or regulatory, legal or judicial
process (including interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), to disclose
Confidential Information, such party will provide the other parties with
prompt notice of such event so that the other parties may seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with Section 6.03(d).
In the event any party determines to seek such protective order or other
remedy, the other parties will cooperate with such party in seeking such
protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained and disclosure of Confidential Information is
required, or a party grants a waiver hereunder, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Representatives, as the case may be, (i) may, without
liability hereunder furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the
Confidential Information which it is legally required to disclose and (ii)
will exercise its commercially reasonable best efforts to have confidential
treatment accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.   SECTION
6.04. Other Offers. The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, directly or
indirectly, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
Representatives not to (a) take any action to solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or (b) engage
in negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any person that may,
to the Company\'s Knowledge, be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written proposal from a third party regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, engage in the activities specified in clause (b) of
this Section 6.04, if (i) following consultation with outside counsel, the
Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) determines in good faith that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, (ii) following consultation with the Special Committee
Financial Advisor, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or has a reasonable likelihood of resulting
in a Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company has received from such third
party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not materially less
favorable to the Company than those contained in Section 6.03. The
Company will as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than one
business day after the relevant event) notify Parent in writing (which notice
shall identify the person making the Acquisition Proposal or request for
information and set forth the material terms thereof) after having received
any Acquisition Proposal, or request for nonpublic information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person who is, to
the Company\'s Knowledge, considering making or has made an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will keep Parent currently informed of the status and
material developments and terms   27  33 of any such Acquisition Proposal
or request and any related material discussions or negotiations. The Company
and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall prohibit the Company, its Board of
Directors or the Special Committee from taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party to the extent required under the
Exchange Act or from making such disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company which, after consultation with outside counsel of the Company, the
Special Committee (or the Board of Directors of the Company acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) determines is required under
applicable law; provided that nothing in this sentence shall affect the
obligations of the Company, its Board of Directors or the Special Committee
under any other provision of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or
proposal by or on behalf of Parent or its affiliates) for, or any indication
of interest in (w) a merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction,
involving the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, (x) a
purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets or
deposits of any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, (y) a purchase or
other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
tender offer or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial
ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto
in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of securities representing 25% or more of the voting power of the
Company or 25% or more of the voting power of any Significant Subsidiary of
the Company, or (z) any substantially similar transaction.   SECTION 6.05.
Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, for six
years from and after the Effective Time, maintain in effect the
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation obligations set forth in
the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s Certificate of Incorporation and
the Company\'s By-Laws, as amended, or other organizational documents, in
each case as of the date of this Agreement as continuing obligations of the
Surviving Corporation and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified during such period in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the individuals who on or at any time prior
to the Effective Time were entitled to rights thereunder with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Merger Sub and
the Company agree that the indemnification and advancement obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary as set forth in indemnification agreements to which
it is a party shall be continuing obligations of the Surviving Corporation or
such Subsidiary, as applicable, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Effective Time, except as permitted by the terms
and provisions of those agreements.   (b) The Surviving Corporation and the
Company shall maintain in effect, for six years from and after the Effective
Time, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies covering the
persons who are currently covered in their capacities as directors and
officers (the "Covered Parties") by the Company\'s current directors\' and
officers\' policies and on terms not materially less favorable than the
existing insurance coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, in the event the annual premium for
such coverage exceeds an amount equal to 225% of the last annual premium paid
immediately prior to the date hereof by the Company for such coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible
for an annual premium equal to 225% of the last annual premium paid
immediately prior to   28  34 the date hereof by the Company. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the
Closing for purposes of this Section 6.05, which policies provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that the Company shall
not purchase any such policies if the cost thereof would exceed the amount
specified in the preceding sentence and shall consult with Parent prior to
purchasing any such policy in order to determine the most cost-effective and
efficient means of obtaining such coverage. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, Parent shall and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the Company\'s obligations thereunder. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors and assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.   (c) In
addition to, and not in lieu of the foregoing, Merger Sub agrees that
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend (with mutually acceptable
counsel) and hold harmless all current and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, as amended from time to time, from and against
all liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement; provided the Surviving
Corporation has approved such settlement), costs, expenses and
claims (including without limitation reasonable legal fees and disbursements,
which shall be paid, reimbursed or advanced by the Surviving Corporation in
advance of the final disposition thereof arising out of actions taken prior
to the Effective Time in performance of their duties as directors or officers
of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations to the Indemnified Parties under this Section
6.05(c) shall not be effective until consummation of the Merger.   (d) In
the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating thereto
or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is commenced, whether
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their respective reasonable efforts to vigorously defend against and
respond thereto.   (e) Following the Effective Time Parent shall cause
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their obligations under
this Section 6.05.   SECTION 6.06. Notification of Certain Matters. From
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of:   29  35  (a)
any change or event , or series of changes or events, having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on it or would be reasonably likely to cause any of the
conditions in Article VII not to be satisfied or to cause the satisfaction
thereof to be materially delayed;   (b) the receipt of any material notice
or other material communication from any person alleging that the consent of
such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby;   (c) the receipt of any material notice or other
material communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and   (d) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the party,
threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company which seeks to prohibit
or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;  in each
case, to the extent such event or circumstance is or becomes known to the
party required to give such notice; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall not be deemed to be an
amendment of this Agreement or any Section in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, and shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
prior to the date of this Agreement.   SECTION 6.07. Public Announcements.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by law or regulation or any listing agreement with the NYSE or any
national or non-U.S. securities exchange to which Parent or the Company is a
party and, in such case, shall use their reasonable best efforts to consult
with all the parties hereto prior to such release or statement being issued.
The parties shall agree on the text of a joint press release by which Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will announce the execution of this Agreement.  
SECTION 6.08. Exchange Act and NYSE Filings. Unless an exemption shall be
expressly applicable, or unless Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the
case may be, agrees otherwise in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company and their respective affiliates will timely file with the SEC and the
NYSE all reports required to be filed pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC and NYSE (including, without limitation, all required financial
statements). Such reports and other information shall comply in all material
respects with all of the requirements of the SEC and NYSE rules and
regulations, and when filed, will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.   30       36  SECTION
6.09. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their reasonable best
efforts to take all action necessary and to do all things necessary, proper
or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit the
consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 6.10.
Performance by Merger Sub. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations hereunder.   SECTION 6.11. Takeover Statutes. The Company will
take all steps necessary to exempt (or continue the exemption of) the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from, or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable "moratorium",
"control share", "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws and regulations of
any state or, upon the reasonable request of Parent, any non-U.S.
jurisdiction, as now or hereafter in effect.   SECTION 6.12. Standstill
Agreement. Notwithstanding Section 2.2 of the Standstill Agreement, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries may take any and all action necessary or, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent (subject to the prior approval of the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), desirable in order to
fulfill any and all express obligations and rights under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 6.01(b) and Section
8.01(h) hereof and to make public announcements or solicit proxies
in response to any Acquisition Proposal made to the Company. The
Standstill Agreement shall terminate automatically at the Effective Time.
Except as provided in this Section 6.12, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a waiver, modification or amendment of the Standstill Agreement
or any provision of the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-
Laws.   SECTION 6.13. Employee Benefits. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize prior actual and credited service recognized under the plans of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") as
service under the employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries for
all purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accruals) in which such
Company Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, it
being intended that such credits of service shall not result in duplication
of benefits under such plans.   (b) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain, employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements for Company Employees which provide benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided under the applicable
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (excluding plans
exempt under Section 201(2) of ERISA)) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
generally available to Company Employees in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time until the earlier of (i) two years after the Effective Time
and (ii) the time that Parent or its Subsidiaries makes available to such
Company Employees employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than are provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries in the applicable
jurisdiction. Any such plans, programs, policies and arrangements, and any
awards thereunder to the extent not paid in connection with the Merger, that
currently   31  37 provide for benefits based on performance targets,
including without limitation the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Incentive
Plan for Key Executives, shall be amended by Parent in consultation with the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time to reflect new and reasonable performance
targets. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.13(b), neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to maintain any such
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement if adjustment to such
plan, program, policy or arrangement would be necessary or desirable under
the Code or any similar law.   (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) give credit for all
current year deductibles, co-payments and annual out-of-pocket limits paid or
incurred by any Company Employee in respect of claims incurred by such
Company Employee during the portion of the current calendar year prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) waive any pre-existing conditions provisions under
any group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries covering the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such
provisions were waived with respect to such Company Employees and their
eligible dependents pursuant to the terms of the group health plans of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Group Health
Plans") and to the extent that such Company Employees and their eligible
dependents were covered under the Company Group Health Plans.   (d) Parent
intends to provide, after the Closing, (i) an opportunity for senior
executives of the Surviving Corporation to participate in a Parent stock
option program as may be in effect at such time, at the same level
as similarly situated employees of Parent participate and (ii) an opportunity
for other salaried employees (not including such senior executives) of the
Surviving Corporation to participate in a Parent discounted stock purchase
program as may be in effect at such time (together with such stock option
program, "Parent Equity Programs"); provided that, in each case, any awards
granted under the Parent Equity Programs will be subject to a determination
by Parent that such awards will not subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to additional or different SEC reporting requirements than the requirements
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are currently subject, including,
without limitation, a requirement that Parent reconcile its financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. Awards granted under the Parent Equity
Programs will be determined by Parent in consultation with the Chief
Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to expressly assume the
BancWest Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (in accordance with Section
4.4 of such plan), the BancWest Corporation Excess Benefit Plan (in
accordance with Section 6.4 of such plan), the Supplemental Cooke Trust Plan
(in accordance with Section 5.4 of such plan) and the BancWest Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (in accordance with Section 4.3 of such plan) and
all obligations and liabilities thereunder, in accordance with the terms of
such plans.   (f) At the Effective Time, the maximum target value attainable
under all outstanding Awards (as defined in the BancWest Corporation Long
Term Incentive Plan (the "Long Term Incentive Plan")) outstanding less than
six months shall be deemed to have been fully earned, and all such Awards
shall be paid as soon as practicable after the Effective Time to    32 
38 the holders of such Awards (reduced by all applicable withholding taxes
and other similar charges). All other outstanding Awards shall be paid in
accordance with the Long Term Incentive Plan as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION 7.01.
Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation To Effect the Merger. The respective
obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the
satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the

been adopted by the affirmative vote of (i) holders of a majority of the
outstanding Company Common Shares, in accordance with the DGCL and the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and (ii) holders of Company Common
Shares constituting no less than two-thirds of the Company Common Shares
outstanding and entitled to vote at the Company Meeting.   (b) Other

have expired (including, if applicable, the expiration or termination of any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust laws or
merger regulations), other than regulatory approvals or non-objections, or
the expiration of waiting periods the failure to be obtained or to expire
which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the consummation of the Merger or on the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time (such approvals, non-objections and the expiration of all such
waiting periods being referred to herein as the "Requisite Regulatory
Approvals"), and all such Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall be in full
force and effect.   (c) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No order,
injunction or decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction
or other legal restraint or prohibition (an "Injunction") preventing the
consummation of the Merger shall be in effect. No statute, rule, regulation,
order, injunction or decree shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by any Governmental Entity which prohibits or makes illegal the
consummation of the Merger or would constitute a Burdensome Condition.  
SECTION 7.02. Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.
The obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is
also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the
Effective Time of the following conditions:   (a) Representations and
Warranties. Subject to the standard set forth in Section 2.06(b), the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date (except to

shall be true as of such earlier date) as though made on and as of the
Closing Date; and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer of the Company to such
effect.     33  39  (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The
Company shall have performed in all material respects each of the obligations

Requisite Regulatory Approvals) that are necessary for the conduct,
immediately following the Effective Time, by the Surviving Corporation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, substantially as currently
conducted (except for any such approval the failure of which to obtain would
not result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation) shall
have been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect.   (d) No
Burdensome Condition. No Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have imposed any
Burdensome Condition.   SECTION 7.03. Conditions to Obligations of the
Company. The obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger is also

Effective Time of the following conditions:   (a) Representations and
Warranties. Subject to the standard set forth in Section 2.06(b), the

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 8.01. Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company:   (a) by mutual written
consent of the Company (provided that such  termination has been approved by
the Special Committee) and Parent;   (b) by either the Company (provided
that such termination has been  approved by the Special Committee) or Parent
if any Governmental Entity  which must grant or satisfy, as the case may be,
a Requisite Regulatory  Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such
denial has become final  and nonappealable, or any Governmental Entity
of    34  40  competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable injunction  permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the  right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.01(b) shall not be  available to any party whose failure to comply with
Section 6.02(c) has  been the primary cause of such action;   (c) by either
the Company (provided that such termination has been  approved by the Special
Committee) or Parent if the Merger shall not have  been consummated on or
before January 30, 2002, unless the failure of the  Closing to occur by such
date shall be due to the failure of the party  seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and  agreements of such party
set forth herein;   (d) by either the Company (provided that such
termination has been  approved by the Special Committee) or Parent if there
shall have been a  material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or
any of the  representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the
part of  the Company (in the case of Parent) or Parent or Merger Sub (in the
case of  the Company), which breach is not cured, in the case of a breach of
Section  6.04, within 5 days and, in all other cases, within 30 days
following  written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its  nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the date referred
to in Section  8.01(c); provided that such breach, if occurring or continuing
on the  Closing Date, would constitute, individually or in the aggregate with
other  such breaches occurring prior to such time and then continuing, the
failure  of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b), 7.03(a)
or  7.03(b), as applicable;   (e) by either the Company (provided that such
termination has been  approved by the Special Committee) or Parent, if the
Company Meeting shall  have been held and the holders of Company Common
Shares shall have failed  to adopt this Agreement by the vote specified in
Section 7.01(a) at such  meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof in accordance  with applicable law); provided, that Parent shall not
have the right to  terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(e) if
Parent has failed to  comply with Section 6.01(b);   (f) by Parent if the
Special Committee or the Board of Directors of  the Company (by a vote or
consent of a majority of the non-Class A  directors then in office) shall
have (i) withdrawn or modified in a manner  adverse to Parent its favorable
recommendation of this Agreement, or (ii)  recommended any Acquisition
Proposal to the stockholders of the Company;   (g) by Parent if any
Governmental Entity which must grant or satisfy,  as the case may be, a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has granted such  approval subject to a
Burdensome Condition, and such grant and related  Burdensome Condition have
become final and nonappealable; and   (h) by the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting  upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) shall concurrently with  such termination authorize the Company to
enter into an agreement with  respect to an Acquisition    35  41 
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may only exercise its right  to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) if (i) the 
stockholders of the Company have not yet adopted this Agreement at the 
Company Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof or by written 
consent; (ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with 
Section 6.04; (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the 
recommendation of the Special Committee) and after consultation with the 
Special Committee Financial Advisor determines in good faith that such 
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (iv) at least five business 
days shall have passed since Parent received written notice from the  Company
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting  upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) is prepared to accept  such
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms  and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and if by such fifth business  day,
Parent shall not have agreed to increase the Merger Consideration  and/or
revise the other terms of this Agreement so that the Merger  Consideration
and such terms, taken together as so revised, are, in the  good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon  the
recommendation of the Special Committee), superior to such the  consideration
and terms of such Acquisition Proposal and (v) simultaneously  with such
termination, the Company shall make the payment specified in  Section
8.02(b).   SECTION 8.02. Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in
Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,
and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that Sections 6.03(d), 6.03(e),
8.02, 8.04 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall any party hereto
be liable for any punitive damages.   (b) In the event that:   (i) (x)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to (A) Section  8.01(d) as a result
of an intentional breach by the Company of any  representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein, or  (B) Section 8.01(f) or (y) the
Company or Parent terminates this  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e),  
(ii) prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have  been
communicated to the executive management, the Special Committee  or Board of
Directors of the Company or any person shall have publicly  announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an  Acquisition Proposal,
and   (iii) within 12 months of such termination, the Company or any of 
its Subsidiaries consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a 
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,     36 
42 then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination payment equal to $100
million ($100,000,000.00) (the "Company Termination Amount"), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds upon the earlier of (A) signing of a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (B)
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal.   (c) In the event that the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h), then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds concurrently with delivery of notice of
termination by the Company and the making of such payment shall be
a condition of such termination.   (d) For purposes of Sections 8.01 and
8.02, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean a transaction or series of
transactions which, if consummated as proposed, would constitute an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.04) which would result in a
person or group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act), other than Parent and its affiliates, owning, directly or indirectly,
50% of the voting interests in the Company then outstanding or 50% or more of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   (e) The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.02 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set
forth in this Section 8.02, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the Company Termination Amount from each date
for payment until the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. For the avoidance
of doubt, approval by the stockholders of the Company shall not be a
condition to the payment of any amount specified in this Section 8.02.  
SECTION 8.03. Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company; provided, however, that after any adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on

Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the Parent Disclosure

herein and made a part hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein)
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that Merger Sub may assign
all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub; provided, that no such assignment
shall change the amount or nature of the Merger Consideration or relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not
perform such obligations.   SECTION 9.08. Parties in Interest. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.05
(which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and
may be enforced by such persons).   SECTION 9.09. Specific Performance. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms

terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.    
43  49  SECTION 9.10. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. (a)
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed
entirely in such State. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America, in each
case located in the County of New York, for any action, proceeding or
investigation in any court or before any governmental authority
("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, the
defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 6.12, that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or
that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all rights to trial
by jury in connection with any Litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Parent hereby
irrevocably designates French American Banking Corporation (in such capacity,
the "Process Agent"), with an office at 499 Park Avenue New York, New York,
10022 its designee, appointee and agent to receive, for and on its behalf,
service of process in such jurisdiction in any Litigation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and such service shall be deemed complete upon
delivery thereof to the Process Agent; provided that in the case of any such
service upon the Process Agent, the party effecting such service shall also
deliver a copy thereof to Parent in the manner provided in Section 9.03. Each
of the parties further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of
any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing
of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective
upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail. Parent expressly
acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under
the laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America;
provided that Parent\'s consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this
Section 9.10 is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 9.10 and
shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State
of New York other than for such purpose. If the Process Agent shall cease to
act as such or to exist, BNP covenants that it shall appoint without delay
another such agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
consent by any party to jurisdiction in any litigation initiated, or service
of process, by any person who is not a party hereto.     44  50  SECTION
9.11. Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.12.
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.   SECTION 9.13. Construction.
This Agreement and any documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto or
in connection herewith shall be construed without regard to the identity of
the person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each and every
provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments shall be
construed as though all of the parties participated equally in the drafting
of the same. Consequently, the parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of
construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party
shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents and
instruments.   * * * * *        45  51  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the

that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the

corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including

person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery
or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

Article. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a
director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority
vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,
even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors

amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article. Expenses
incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be
paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined

indemnitee only if the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or
part thereof) by the indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors.  
SECTION 10. ENFORCEMENT BY INDEMNITEE. - If a claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article is not paid in full within sixty
days after a written claim therefor by the indemnitee has been received by

entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable law.   SECTION 11. EFFECT OF REPEAL OR MODIFICATION. - Any
