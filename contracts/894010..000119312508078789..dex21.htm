such instructions by telephone call back to the applicable person(s) specified to the Escrow Agent from time to time by an Authorized Person and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person(s) so designated.
To ensure the accuracy of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such call backs. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instruction, or is not satisfied in its sole discretion with the verification it receives, it will not
