1 ARTICLE I

1.01 _Purchase and Sale_. Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser

Each of the items referred to in subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this _Section
1.03(a)_ shall be held by counsel to Parent strictly to the order of Purchaser
and on terms that Purchaser shall not be bound by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement or other Contracts so delivered unless and until Closing occurs. In
the event that Closing does not take place, each of the items referred to in

account as Seller may reasonably direct by written notice delivered to
Purchaser by Seller at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date,
_provided_ that $25,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") of the Base Purchase
Price shall be delivered by Purchaser by wire transfer of  



 

2  immediately available funds to Citibank, N.A., as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") under an escrow agreement to be entered into on the Closing
Date by Seller, Parent and Purchaser and the Escrow Agent substantially in the
form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") to satisfy any claims
for Losses suffered by Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to  _Article

subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of _Section 1.03(a)_ shall be unconditionally

and (iii) of _Section 1.03(a)_ shall be unconditionally released and
delivered to Purchaser. At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to
Seller and Purchaser the certificates to be delivered pursuant to _Sections
6.03_ ,  _6.09_ (if requested by Purchaser), and _7.03_.

1.04 _Final Purchase Price; Net Worth Adjustment_.

(a) In the event that the amount of the Closing Net Worth is (i) greater than
the Reference Net Worth, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar
for dollar, by the amount by which the Closing Net Worth exceeds the Reference
Net Worth, or (ii) less than the Reference Net Worth, the Base Purchase Price
shall be decreased, dollar for dollar, by the amount by which the Reference
Net Worth exceeds the Closing Net Worth (such increase or decrease, as
applicable, referred to herein as the " _Net Worth Adjustment_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Net Worth Adjustment exceed the
Holdback Amount. The Base Purchase Price, as so increased or decreased, is
referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_ ".

(b) In order to conclusively determine the Closing Net Worth and the Net
Worth Adjustment, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date
(but no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), Purchaser will
prepare, and cause Purchasers accountants to audit, the Companys balance
sheet as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). Seller
shall cooperate with Purchaser and Purchasers accountants in connection with
the preparation and audit of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and Seller shall
provide Purchaser and Purchasers accountants with reasonable access to any of
its books, records, schedules, analyses, working papers and other information
relating to the Company. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP from the Books and Records applying, in all material
respects, the accounting principles used to determine the Reference Net Worth
and as applied in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements. Set
forth as Annex A hereto is the schedule of assets and liabilities of the
Company as of December 31, 2007 used in determining the Reference Net Worth.

(c) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller on or prior to the date on which the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is due (i) the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) a
statement of the calculation of the Closing Net Worth and (iii) a statement of
the calculation of the resulting Net Worth Adjustment (collectively, the "
_Net Worth Statement_ "). The Net Worth Statement shall be final and binding
on the parties, and deemed accepted by Seller unless, within sixty (60) days
after Sellers receipt thereof, Seller provides Purchaser with a written
notice of objection to the Net Worth Statement (an " _Objection Notice_ ").
The Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail each item on the Net
Worth Statement that Seller disputes and the nature of any objection so
asserted. Any items not specifically identified in the Objection Notice shall
be deemed  



 

3  accepted by Seller. Purchaser agrees that during such 60-day period
following Sellers receipt of the Net Worth Statement, Seller and
its representatives shall have, for purposes of evaluating the Net Worth
Statement, reasonable access to properties and appropriate books, records,
schedules, analyses, working papers and other information used in the
preparation of the Net Worth Statement. Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause Purchasers accountants to make all of its work papers
underlying the review and audit of the Closing Date Balance Sheet reasonably
available to Seller and its representatives and to consult in good faith with
Seller and its representatives during such period.

(d) During the 60-day period following the date on which the Objection Notice
is received by Purchaser, Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to
resolve any objections contained therein. If Seller and Purchaser are unable
to resolve the dispute within such 60-day period, then any disputed matter
set forth in the Objection Notice which remains unresolved shall be submitted
by Seller and Purchaser for a final determination to an independent accounting
firm of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Seller
and Purchaser (or, if Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on such an accounting
firm, then each shall select an accounting firm (other than an accountant of
the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates) and such accounting firms
shall select a third accounting firm (other than an accountant of the parties
hereto or their respective Affiliates) (the accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by Seller and Purchaser or by their selected accounting firms being the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ")). The Independent Accounting Firm shall,
based solely on the presentations made by Seller and Purchaser and within
sixty (60) days after its appointment, render a written report as to the
resolution of each disputed matter set forth in the Objection Notice which
remains outstanding, and as to the calculation of the Closing Net Worth, the
Net Worth Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be the sole recourse and remedy of the parties against
one another or any other Person with respect to, any disputes arising out of
or relating to the calculation of the Closing Net Worth, Net Worth
Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price. The Independent Accounting Firms
determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties and shall be
enforceable in a court of Law.

(e) The Independent Accounting Firms fees and expenses shall be borne equally
by Seller and Purchaser. Each party shall otherwise bear its own costs and
expenses associated with the resolution of such dispute, including the fees
and expenses of their respective accountants and attorneys.

(f) The Final Purchase Price shall become final and binding upon the parties
upon the earlier of (i) the failure by Seller to object thereto within the
period permitted under, and otherwise in accordance with, the requirements
of  _Section 1.04(c)_, (ii) the written agreement between Purchaser and
Seller with respect thereto or (iii) the decision by the Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to disputes under _Section 1.04(d)_.

(g) If the Base Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct the Adjustment Amount from the Holdback
Amount and shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase
Price has become final and binding under _Section 1.04(f)_, pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the amount of the Holdback Amount
remaining following such deduction, if any, plus interest accrued thereon (at
 



 

4  the Interest Rate) from the Closing Date to, but not including, the date of
actual payment, to such account as Seller may reasonably direct; _provided_
,  _however_ , that if the Adjustment Amount exceeds the Holdback Amount,
Purchasers sole recourse under this _Section 1.04(g)_ shall be to retain the
entire Holdback Amount.

(h) If the Final Purchase Price equals or exceeds the Base Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price
has become final and binding under _Section 1.04(f)_, pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (i) the Holdback Amount and (ii) the Adjustment
Amount, if any, plus interest accrued on such amounts (at the Interest Rate)
from the Closing Date to, but not including, the date of actual payment, to
such account as Seller may reasonably direct; _provided_ , however, that in no
event shall the Adjustment Amount exceed $10,000,000.

1.05 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from
time to time after the Closing, each of the parties hereto shall execute and
deliver such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper
or advisable, to the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement. Seller and Parent shall use best efforts from time to
time after the Closing to execute and deliver to Purchaser such other
documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as Purchaser may reasonably request more effectively to
vest title to the Shares in Purchaser and, to the full extent permitted by
Law, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the
Company and its Assets and Properties and Books and Records, and otherwise to
cause Seller and Parent to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Following the Closing, each party will afford the other party, its counsel
and its accountants, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access to the books, records and other data relating to the
Business or Condition of the Company in its possession with respect to periods
prior to the Closing and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to
the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the requesting party
in connection with (i) compliance with the requirements of any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, (ii) the determination or enforcement of the rights and
obligations of any party to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (iii) any
actual or threatened Action or Proceeding (iv) the preparation of Tax Returns
and (v) the Members Voluntary Liquidation. Further, each party agrees for a
period extending for the earlier of (x) six (6) years after the Closing Date
and (y) the final liquidation of Seller not to destroy or otherwise dispose of

of any provisions of this _Section 4.12_ shall not render unenforceable, or
impair, the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 4.12_. Accordingly,
if any provision of this _Section 4.12_ shall be determined to be invalid or

will cause any covenant or agreement of Seller or Parent under this Agreement

warranty of Seller or Parent contained in this Agreement as if the same were
made on or as of the date of such event, transaction or circumstance.
Except with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 2.10, 2.13, 2.18_ and _2.22_ , no notice given pursuant to this
_Section 4.13_ shall have any effect on the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of
determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein or shall in any way
limit Purchasers right to seek indemnity under _Article VIII_ or _Article
X_. Any update to  _Sections 2.10, 2.13, 2.18 and 2.22 of the Disclosure
Schedule_ pursuant to this _Section 4.13_ shall be deemed to qualify and
modify the representations and warranties in such Section for all purposes of

event within ten (10) Business Days), Parent shall submit to the
United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, being the competent authority
under Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the " _FSA_ ") a
draft of the circular (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto and any other related materials, the " _Circular_ ") addressed to its
shareholders convening a general meeting (the " _Parent Shareholder Meeting_
") to approve the Shareholder Resolutions, together with all other
documents required to be lodged with the FSA before it will approve a
circular relating to a Class 1 transaction under the Listing Rules; and use
all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval of the Circular as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to such submission of the Circular and any supplement
thereto, Parent shall reasonably cooperate and _provide_ Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Circular, and to approve
any reference to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and the form and context
in which any such reference in the Circular appears. Purchaser agrees, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to provide such information to Parent
concerning Purchaser and its Affiliates as may be reasonably required to be
disclosed in the Circular and any required supplement thereto. If any event
with respect to Purchaser, or with respect to information supplied by
Purchaser expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Circular, shall occur which is required to be described in an amendment or
supplement to the Circular, Purchaser shall promptly advise Parent and
cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation of any materials
required to be filed with the FSA in connection therewith. Parent shall cause
the Circular, as so corrected, to be filed with the FSA and to be disseminated
to its shareholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable Law.

with _Section 4.14(a)_, and in any event no later than two (2) Business Days
thereafter, Parent shall take all actions necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the articles of association of Parent (which shall not be
amended in any material respect prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) to post the Circular to its shareholders convening the
Parent Shareholder Meeting to approve the transactions contemplated herein
and cause the Shareholder Resolutions to be properly proposed and voted upon
by shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting, and shall not
cancel or adjourn the Parent Shareholder Meeting or change any of
the resolutions contained in the Circular without the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parent Shareholder Meeting shall be adjourned if and to
the extent necessary to ensure that all of the consents, approvals, actions,
filings, notices or waiting periods described in or related to _Sections 6.05_
to _6.09_ (inclusive), _6.12_ , _7.04_ to _7.06_ (inclusive) shall have

the Circular shall contain the Board Recommendation (which recommendation
shall state that in giving their recommendation, the directors on the Parent
Board have been advised by the financial advisors to Parent).

(c) The Parent Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Purchaser, the Boards Recommendation, (ii)
take  



 

33  any action or make any statement in connection with the Parent Shareholder
Meeting inconsistent in any material respect with the Board
Recommendation, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or fail to recommend against, any Acquisition Proposal (any and all
of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), referred to herein as
a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 4.14(c)_, the Parent Board may make a Change of
Recommendation if: 

(i) it receives an unsolicited and bona fide Acquisition Proposal in writing
that did not result from or arise from a breach of _Section 4.04(a)_;

(ii) the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with, and
based on the advice of, its legal and financial advisers, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a
Change of Recommendation would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
directors on the Parent Board or would violate their obligations to the
extent applicable under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the Companies
Act 1985, the Companies Act 2006, the rules and regulations of the UKLA or any
other applicable Laws or regulations or rules of a regulatory body;

(iii) Purchaser has received written notice from Seller and Parent (a "
_Change of Recommendation Notice_ ") at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (A) expressly state that
Parent and Seller have received an Acquisition Proposal which the Parent Board
has concluded is a Superior Proposal and that Parent and Seller intend to
effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which Parent and Seller
intend or may intend to do so, and (B) include the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of the most current version of
the agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that any
material amendment to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
Change of Recommendation Notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
Change of Recommendation;

(iv) during any such notice period, Parent and Seller and their advisors have
negotiated in good faith with Purchaser to make amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(v) such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account all changes to the terms
of this Agreement agreed to by Purchaser);

_provided that_ nothing in this _Section 4.14(d)_ shall be construed as
limiting or otherwise qualifying Parents obligations under _Section
4.14(b)_.



 

34 (e) Notwithstanding _Section 4.14(d)_, Parent will submit the Shareholder
Resolutions for approval by its shareholders at the Parent Shareholder
Meeting even if the Parent Board makes a Change of Recommendation.

(f) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days), Parent shall file a preliminary proxy
statement that will be provided to the shareholders of Parent in connection
with the solicitation of proxies from shareholders at the Parent Shareholder
Meeting relating to the Shareholder Resolutions (the " _Preliminary Proxy
Statement_ ") with the SEC, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain and furnish the information required to be included by it in the
Proxy Statement and, after consultation with Purchaser, respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Preliminary Proxy Statement and any subsequent version thereof and cause a
definitive proxy statement (the " _Definitive Proxy Statement_ ", and together
with the Preliminary Proxy Statement, accompanying letter to shareholders,
notice of meeting, form of proxy and schedules or other materials included
therewith, each, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be
mailed to its shareholders as soon as is reasonably practicable following the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to such submission of the
Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Definitive Proxy Statement and any
supplements thereto, Parent shall reasonably cooperate and provide Purchaser
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Preliminary Proxy
Statement and Definitive Proxy Statement and any such supplements and to
approve any reference to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates therein and the
form and context in which any such reference appears (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld). Purchaser agrees, as promptly as practicable, to
provide all information to Parent concerning Purchaser and its Affiliates
reasonably requested by Parent.

(g) (i) Parent shall promptly notify Purchaser upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide
Purchaser with copies of all material correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable efforts to
consult with Purchaser prior to responding to such comments.

(ii) If at any time prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting, any information
relating to Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or Seller which, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent or Seller, should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, Parent shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, and the
parties shall cooperate in Parents preparation of an appropriate amendment
or supplement to be filed with the SEC (which shall include Parent providing
Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment prior to filing
any amendment or supplement). Parent shall cause such Proxy Statement, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its
shareholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.



 

35 (iii) If any event with respect to Purchaser, or with respect to information
supplied by Purchaser expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement, shall occur which is required to be described in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Purchaser shall promptly
advise Parent and cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation of
any materials required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith.

SEC and to be disseminated to its shareholders, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable Laws.

paid time off, vacation, sick pay, and severance (but not for benefit
accrual), a Company Employees service with the Company shall be recognized
under the comparable Company plan and treated as service with Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
Following the Closing Date, for purposes of each employee benefit plan in
which any Company Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) waive any pre-
existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was
satisfied or waived under the comparable employee benefit plan of the Company
as of the Closing Date, except to the extent not permitted under applicable
insurance contracts for life and long-term disability insurance, and (ii)
provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made
or incurred prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in which the Closing
occurs. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict in any way
Purchasers right, following the Closing Date, to modify the terms and
conditions of employment of any Company Employee or to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time.

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall provide severance payments and benefits to eligible Company Employees
on a basis no less favorable to such employees than benefits determined under
with the terms of Companys Severance Pay Policy, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and as set forth in _Section 5.05(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule_, and for purposes thereof, a Company Employees service with the
Company or any Affiliate shall be treated as service with Purchaser.

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller in cash $5,172,000, which
amount will be used by Seller and Parent to pay the severance and change
of control amounts on the Closing Date described in the Change of Control
Arrangements listed in (and in the amounts set forth in) _Section 4.08(a)(i)
of the Disclosure Schedule_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any individual
who is listed in _Section 4.08(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_ fails to
execute and deliver, prior to the Closing, a consent and release substantially
in the form set forth in _Section 4.08(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_,
then such amount shall be reduced by the amount(s) set forth under such
individuals Change of Control Arrangement(s) listed in (and in the amount(s)
set forth in) _Section 4.08(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_. In addition to
the foregoing, from and following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide, or
shall continue to provide the non-cash benefits described in _Section
4.08(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule_ to the individuals listed therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to provide or
continue to provide such benefits to any such individual unless and until such
individual has executed and delivered the consent and release described in the
foregoing sentence.



 

38 (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.05_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 5.05_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. 

5.06 _Letters of Credit_. Purchaser shall, with respect to each letter of
credit described on _Section 5.06 of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the "
_Existing Letters of Credit_ "), either (a) cause replacement letters of
credit to be issued to the beneficiaries of such Existing Letter of Credit,
obtain the originals of such Existing Letter of Credit from the beneficiary
thereof to return to General Electric Capital Corporation (" _GE_ ") and
deliver to GE each such Existing Letter of Credit on or prior to the Closing
or (b) provide arrangements satisfactory to the entity that issued such
Existing Letter of Credit in the form of cash collateral, back-up letters of
credit or other credit support, in each case in a manner consented to by GE
such that GE will deliver to Danka on the Closing Date an unconditional
release of all of the obligations of the Company and Seller with respect to
such Existing Letter of Credit, including without limitation, all such
obligations under the Danka Credit Facility.

ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS AND POST-CLOSING TAXES

8.01 _Tax Filings_.

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to
be timely filed (including valid extensions), all Tax Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "), and
shall pay or cause to be paid when due in accordance with _Section 8.04(a)_
(and without duplication thereof), all Taxes required to be paid by or with
respect to the Company, for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ " and any such period a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_
"), but only to the extent that such Pre-Closing Taxes exceed the accruals
for any such Taxes taken into account in calculating the Net Worth Adjustment.
Seller shall prepare all Pre-Closing Tax Returns  



 

42  consistent with its prior practices, except as otherwise required by Law,
and shall provide each Pre-Closing Tax Return to Purchaser and the Company no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing any such Pre-
Closing Tax Return and will in good faith consider any comments that Purchaser
or the Company may have with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Seller will
not amend any Pre-Closing Tax Return without the written approval of
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser will,
or will cause the Company to, prepare pro forma United States federal income
Tax Returns with respect to the Company (" _Pro Forma Returns_") for the
taxable year ending March 31, 2008 (to the extent not previously prepared and
provided by Seller), and for the short Tax period beginning on April 1, 2008,
and ending on the Closing Date, for the purpose of allowing Seller to file
Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Pro Forma Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practice (except as otherwise required by
Law). Purchaser or the Company shall deliver the Pro Forma Returns to Seller
in a time and manner consistent with past practice, and each of Purchaser and
the Company shall provide any information or assistance requested by Seller
with respect to the Pro Forma Returns that is required, in the reasonable
judgment of Seller, to prepare and file any Pre-Closing Tax Return. Seller
shall promptly reimburse Purchaser or the Company for any third-party fees
relating to such preparation.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file all Tax
Returns of the Company required to be filed after the Closing Date,
other than any Pre-Closing Tax Returns, and shall pay (or cause to be paid)
in accordance with _Section 8.04(b)_ (and without duplication thereof), any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Returns
filed with respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Purchaser shall notify Seller of its
share of any amounts due in respect of any such Tax Return no later than ten
(10) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due (Sellers share
of Straddle Period Taxes to be determined pursuant to paragraph (e) below),
and Seller shall remit such payment to Purchaser no later than five (5) days
prior to the date such Tax Return is due.

(c) In the case of any Tax Return that is filed by Purchaser with respect to a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with the Company and Sellers past practice, except as otherwise
required by Law, and shall deliver such Tax Return to Seller for its review at
least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed. If Seller disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify
Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection.
The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to
the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed. If the parties
cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an
Independent Accounting Firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser. The
fees, charges and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser.

(d) The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect
with the relevant Tax authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period
ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date as a short taxable
period. If applicable law does not permit the parties to treat the Closing
Date as the end of a short taxable period, then, in the case of any Taxes of
the Company that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods, the portion of
any such Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
that ends on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of Taxes that are based
upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a  



 

43  transactional basis or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) outside
the ordinary course of business, be deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date (except that,
solely for purposes of determining the marginal Tax rate applicable to income
or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which such Tax rate
depends upon the level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts
shall be taken into account, if appropriate, for an equitable sharing of such
Taxes); and (ii) in the case of other Taxes, be allocated pro rata per day
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning the day
after the Closing Date.

(e) Except for the Code Section 338(h)(10) election described in _Section
8.06_, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause any entity over which it has
direct or indirect voting control (including the Company) not to, amend
any Tax Return or change or make Tax elections of or relating to the Company
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Tax period
that begins before and ends after a Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_
that Seller shall be deemed to have consented if it does not object to a
request from Purchaser or the Company within ten (10) days of receipt and no
such consent shall be required following the final liquidation of Seller. At
Sellers request, Purchaser shall cause the Company to make or join with
Seller in making any other election if the making of such election would not
have an adverse impact on Purchaser or the Company for any Post-Closing Tax
period.

8.02 _Tax Cooperation_.

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including access to books and records) and assistance as is reasonably
requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution,
defense or conduct of any Contest. Such cooperation shall be at the requesting
partys expense, subject to the parties respective obligations described in
_Section 8.04_. Any information obtained under this _Section 8.02_ shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding.
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (a) use its reasonable best efforts to
properly retain and maintain (or cause to be retained and maintained) the Tax
and accounting records of the Company that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and Straddle Periods for the earlier of (x) six (6) years after the Closing
Date and (y) the final liquidation of Seller and each party shall thereafter
provide the other party with written notice prior to any destruction,
abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such records, (b)
transfer such records to the other party upon its written request prior to any
such destruction, abandonment or disposition and (c) allow the other party
and its affiliates and their respective agents and representatives, at times
and dates reasonably and mutually acceptable to the parties, to from time to
time inspect and review such records as such party may deem necessary or
appropriate; _provided_ , however, that in all cases, such activities are to
be conducted during normal business hours and at the requesting partys sole
expense.

8.03 _Tax Refunds, Credits, Etc_. Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller any
refunds or credits of Taxes received by Purchaser or the Company (i) relating
to the Company for any taxable year or taxable period or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date,  



 

44  or (ii) attributable to an amount paid by Seller, in each case, except to
the extent any such amount is taken into account in determining the
Final Purchaser Price or to the extent of any Taxes for which Purchaser is
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.04. Purchaser shall be entitled to
all other refunds and credits of Taxes.

8.04 _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, the Company and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives, and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all claims,
actions, causes of action, liabilities, losses, damages, and reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses and costs resulting from, arising out of or relating to
(i) any Taxes, but only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the accruals for
any such Taxes taken into account in calculating the Net Worth Adjustment, of
or payable by the Company relating to (x) being included (or required to be
included) on any Pre-Closing Tax Return, (y) any Pre-Closing Taxes and (z)
that portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date (calculated
as set forth in _Section 8.01(d)_ above), (ii) any Taxes for which the
Seller is liable under _Section 8.07_, and (iii) without duplication of
amounts included in clauses (i) and (ii) any Taxes resulting from a breach of
the representations in  _Section 2.12_. The indemnity provided in the
foregoing sentence shall include, without limitation, any Tax liability
arising by reason of the Company being severally liable for any Taxes of
another person pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous state, local or foreign Tax provision, by contract as a transferee
or otherwise, any Tax liability incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including Taxes resulting from the making of
any elections pursuant to Code Section 338(h)(10) as provided in _Section
8.06_ hereof (other than Purchasers share of Taxes described in _Section
8.07_), and any Tax liability arising in connection with the payments to be
made to Company employees pursuant to _Section 4.08_, including, those
payments funded by Purchaser as set forth in _Section 4.08 of the Disclosure
Schedule_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement in respect of Taxes of the
Company relating to any taxable year beginning after the Closing Date which
are attributable to any action of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, the Company after the Closing Date) that
occurs after the Closing.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Seller, and each of its respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives, and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all claims, actions, causes
of action, liabilities, losses, damages, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
and costs resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any Taxes of the
Company relating to (x) any tax period beginning after the Closing Date ("
_Post-Closing Tax Periods_ ") and (y) that portion of any Straddle Period that
begins after the Closing Date (calculated as set forth in  _Section 8.01(d)_
above), and (ii) any Taxes for which Purchaser is liable for under _Section
8.07_. The indemnity provided in the foregoing sentence shall include, without
limitation, any Tax liability arising by reason of the Company being
severally liable for any Taxes of another person pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign Tax
provision, by contract as a transferee or otherwise.



 

45 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, including those under this _Section 8.04_, shall be limited solely
to those amounts held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller
shall have no liability under this Agreement in respect of Taxes of
the Company relating to any taxable year beginning after the Closing Date
which are attributable to any action of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, the Company after the Closing Date) that
occurs after the Closing. 

8.05 _Audits, Contests and Tax Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) After the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other party of any
demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit received with respect
to Taxes for which such Seller or Purchaser is liable pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a partys failure to give such notice
will not affect the other partys rights to indemnification under  _Section
8.04_, except to the extent that the other party is materially prejudiced
thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the
relevant portion of any notice or other document received from any Tax
authority or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

(b) At Sellers request and expense, Purchaser shall contest (or cause to be
contested), any asserted Tax liability for which Seller may have an indemnity
obligation. If Seller so elects and Seller first acknowledges in writing
its liability to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the Tax in
question, Seller shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing at its own expense, of any audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to the Company
(any such audit or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred
to herein as a " _Contest_ ") relating to Taxes for which Seller is
exclusively liable pursuant to  _Section 8.04_; _provided_ that Purchaser
shall have the right to participate in such Contest, including through counsel
of its choosing, at its own expense. Seller shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any Contest relating to any Taxes for which Purchaser or the
Company may be held liable (by applicable Law, contract or otherwise) without
the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Purchaser shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any Contest
relating to any Taxes for which the Seller may be held liable (by applicable
Law, contract or otherwise) without the consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) In the case of a Contest that relates to a Straddle Period, Purchaser
shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Seller shall have the right
to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Purchaser shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without the consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) Payment by Seller of any amount due under _Section 8.04_ of this
Agreement shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by
Purchaser that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Governmental
Authority or other applicable third  



 

46  party is due by Seller, _provided_ that Seller shall not be required to make
any payment earlier than five (5) days before it is due to the appropriate
Tax authority or applicable third party. Payment by Purchaser of any amount
due under _Section 8.04_ of this Agreement shall be made within ten (10) days
following written notice by Seller that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Authority or other applicable third party is due by
Purchaser, _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than five (5) days before it is due to the appropriate
Governmental Authority or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that
is contested in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 8.05_,
payment of such contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date
a "final determination" to such effect is made by such Governmental
Authority. For this purpose, a " _final determination_ " shall mean a
settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Governmental
Authority, a deficiency notice with respect to which the period for filing a
petition with the Tax court or the relevant state, local or foreign tribunal
has expired or a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not
subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal has expired.

8.06 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(a) At Purchasers request, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly make a timely
election described in Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder with respect to the Company (the " _Purchased Company_
") and any similar corresponding election under state, local or foreign law
pursuant to which a separate election is permissible with respect to
the Purchased Company (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ").

(b) In accordance with the procedures set forth below, a schedule (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") shall be prepared setting forth the "aggregate deemed
sale price" and the "adjusted grossed-up basis" (each as defined under
applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) for the
Company, and the allocation of such amounts among the assets of the Company
and other relevant items. The Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate.

(c) The procedures for creating the Allocation Schedule shall be as follows:
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver an Allocation Schedule to Seller within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall have thirty (30) days
from the date Purchaser delivers the Allocation Schedule to accept it or
object to it in writing, specifying any objection and the reasons for the
objection in reasonable detail. In the case of any objection by Seller, Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith for no more than thirty (30) days
to resolve their differences and, upon such resolution, if any, any
adjustment to the Allocation schedule shall be made in accordance with the
agreement of Seller and Purchaser. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve any such dispute within the thirty-day period, the dispute shall be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination shall be
binding and final between the parties. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good
faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. The Independent
Accounting Firm may rely only upon information submitted to it by Seller or

each partys position. If Seller does not deliver to Purchaser reasonable
written objections on or before thirty one (31) days from the date that

Authority or otherwise (except as required by law). In the event that
a determination or allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule is
disputed by a Tax Authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall
promptly notify the other party of such dispute. Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Purchased Company, to cooperate in good faith with each
other to take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such Tax
Returns as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely Section 338(h)(10)
Election in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations, and, if
applicable, any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.

(f) Seller and Purchaser shall each prepare all Tax Returns, including any
Forms 8883 and other statements (together, the " _Section 338 Forms_ "), other
than Form 8023 which shall be executed at Closing, as provided under
applicable law, in accordance with (i) the Allocation Schedule and (ii) the
terms of this Agreement, and shall deliver such Section 338 Forms to the other
party for their review and comment. Seller and Purchaser shall act in good
faith to execute within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing
Date any and all of the Section 338 Forms appropriate and necessary to
effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election to the extent practicable. If
Seller and Purchaser do not agree with respect to the Section 338 Forms,
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith for a period of thirty (30)
days to resolve their differences with respect to the Section 338 Forms and
upon such resolution, if any, any adjustment to the Section 338 Forms shall
be made in accordance with the agreement of Seller and Purchaser. If Seller
and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute within the thirty-day
period, the dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and
such determination shall be binding and final between the parties. Seller and
Purchaser shall act in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as
possible. The Independent Accounting Firm may rely only upon
information submitted to it by Seller or Purchaser. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use reasonable best efforts to deliver
to Seller and Purchaser a written report setting forth the resolution of each
disputed matter within twenty (20) days of submission of the dispute to it.
The fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be allocated by the Independent Accounting Firm between Seller and
Purchaser in accordance with its judgment as to the relative merits of each
partys position. In no event shall any such dispute prevent the timely filing
of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller  



 

48  and Purchaser shall each cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly executed by
the proper authorized persons for executing such Section 338 Forms and shall
duly and timely file, or have duly and timely filed, the Section 338 Forms in
accordance with applicable Tax laws and the terms of this Agreement.

transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees or similar Taxes
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated

Returns relating to Transfer Tax that are required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and if required by applicable law,
Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of

connection with the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating to

establish a valid claim under _Article X_ (on or prior to such termination
date), until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or
otherwise resolved as provided in _Article X_.

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this _Section 10.01_ and the other Sections

against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or
to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or
relating to any breach of representation or warranty (other than any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller and Parent in _Section 2.12_,
as to which  _Section 8.04_ shall govern) or nonfulfillment of or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement (other than any breach of any covenant or
agreement by the Seller in _Article VIII_ , as to which _Article VIII_ shall
govern) on the part of Seller or Parent contained in this Agreement
(determined in all cases as if the terms "material" or "materially" were not

(b) Subject to the other Sections of this _Article X_ , Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained
by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from,
arising out of or relating to any breach of representation or warranty or
nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part
of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

(c) No amount or amounts shall be payable in the case of a claim by a

(i) (A) unless the amount of the Losses incurred as to any individual claim
or series of related individual claims exceeds $25,000 and (B) unless and
until and then only to the extent that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
suffered, incurred, sustained or become subject to Losses referred to in such
Section in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate (in determining whether this
aggregate threshold has been satisfied, only Losses exceeding the per claim
threshold set forth in the foregoing clause (A) shall be included);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the total payments from Seller or Parent to
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of all claims made under this
_Section 10.01_ and _Section 8.04_ shall be limited to the amounts held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement;

(ii) to the extent that the Purchaser Indemnified Party had a reasonable

indemnity; or

(iv) to the extent it arises directly from or was caused directly by actions
taken or unreasonably failed to be taken (other than mitigation of such Loss,
which shall be governed by _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_) by the
Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates after the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all claims
for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, including those under this _Section 10.01_ and _Section 8.04_,
shall be limited solely to those amounts held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.



 

50 10.02 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under  _Section 10.01_ will be asserted and resolved as
follows:

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section 10.01_ is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Purchaser,
Seller or Parent or any Affiliate of Purchaser, Seller or Parent (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice setting
forth in reasonable detail the specific facts and circumstances pertaining
thereto with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with reasonable
promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim will be limited to the extent that the
Indemnifying Partys ability to defend has been materially prejudiced by such
failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under
_Section 10.01_ and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost
and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
10.02(a)_, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently
prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled
at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, in the
case of any settlement that provides for any relief other than the payment of
monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in
full). The Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence) any settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party,
at any time prior to the Indemnifying Partys delivery of the notice referred
to in the first sentence of this clause (i), file any motion, answer or other
pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its interests; and
_provided_ _further_ , that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this clause (i), and the Indemnified Party will
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such separate counsel, except
as provided in the preceding sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party
will pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the
Indemnified Partys good faith judgment, it is  



 

51  advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be
represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the
named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith,
based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are
unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its
right to indemnity under _Section 10.01_ with respect to such Third Party
Claim.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_, or if the Indemnifying Party
gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle
the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right
to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third
Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be
vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith or
will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with the consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).
The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) any
settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified
Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnified Party is contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this clause (ii), if the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and
if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner
provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required
to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Partys defense pursuant to
this clause (ii) or of the Indemnifying Partys participation therein at the
Indemnified Partys request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse the
Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation.

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does
not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim under _Section 10.01_ or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
the Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section 10.01_ and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand following the final  



 

52  determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution
Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under _Section
10.01_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such partys rights hereunder
except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
materially prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such
Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity
Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
under _Section 10.01_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall
be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.

10.03 _Insurance Offset_. If the amount of any indemnifiable Losses, at any
time following the payment of an indemnification obligation, is offset or
reduced by the payment of any insurance proceeds, the amount of such insurance
proceeds, less any costs, expenses, premiums or taxes incurred in connection
therewith (including but not limited to any future increase in insurance
premiums, retroactive premiums, costs associated with any loss of insurance
and replacement thereof or self-insured component of such insurance coverage)
will promptly be repaid to the Indemnifying Party. In order to mitigate any
of Purchasers indemnifiable Losses following the Closing, the Company shall
file with the applicable insurance carriers any insurance claims relating to
Losses for which indemnification is sought hereunder. 

10.04 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, the
indemnities set forth in _Article VIII_ and this  _Article X_ hereto shall be
the exclusive remedies of Purchaser, Parent and Seller and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates for any breach of this
Agreement, and the parties shall not be entitled to, and hereby waive their
rights to, a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification
rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect of any such breach of
this Agreement.

described herein (including without limitation the Stock Purchase Agreement),
or for determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise

A-4  (iii) subject to _Section 21_ hereof, this Agreement shall constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter
and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements in regard thereto, (iv)
the Escrow Agent shall not be required to expend or risk any of its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial or other liability in the performance of any
of its duties hereunder and (v) the Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to
take any legal or other action hereunder which might in its judgment involve
or cause it to incur any expense or liability unless it shall have been
furnished with acceptable indemnification.

(b) _Standard of Care_. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to afford the
Escrow Property any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar
property. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any damage, loss or injury
resulting from any action taken or omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable (i) for any indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive or special losses or damages, regardless
of the form of action and whether or not any such losses or damages were
foreseeable or contemplated, (ii) for the acts or omissions of any
nominees, correspondents, designees, agents, subagents or subcustodians (not
resulting from its or their bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction), or (iii) for the
investment or reinvestment of any Escrow Property, or any liquidation of such
investment or reinvestment, executed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not
resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct as adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction) in the investment or reinvestment of the
Escrow Property, any loss of interest incident to any such delays, or any loss
or penalty as a result of the liquidation of any investment before its stated
maturity date.

(d) _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order,
judgment, certification, demand, instruction, notice, instrument, consent,
authorization, receipt, power of attorney, e-mail, .pdf or other writing
delivered to it without being required to determine the authenticity or
validity thereof, or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the
propriety or validity or the service thereof or the jurisdiction of the court
issuing any judgment or order. The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that any
person purporting to make any statement or execute any document in connection
with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

(e)  _Consultation_. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel satisfactory
to it, and the opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion and advice of
such counsel.

6\. _Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification_. 

(a) _Compensation_ : Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees to
pay the Escrow Agents fees and all reasonable expenses specified in
_Schedule A_ and incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with this
Agreement; provided, however, that the payment of such fees and expenses shall
be shared equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller and  



 

A-5  Parent, on the other hand. In the event that such fees or expenses, or any
other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent (or its counsel) are not paid to
the Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days following the presentment of an
invoice for the payment of such fees and expenses or the demand for such
payment, then the Escrow Agent may, without further action or notice, pay such
fees from the Escrow Property and may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of
any Escrow Property for such purpose; _provided_ , that if the Buyer has not
paid its portion of such fees and the Escrow Agent pays itself from the Escrow
Property, the Buyer shall promptly pay such fees into the Escrow Account and
_provided_ , _further_ that if the Seller and Parent have not paid their
portion of such fees and the Escrow Agent pays itself from the Escrow
Property, the Escrow Agent shall deduct such amount from the amount disbursed
to the Seller and Parent pursuant to _Section 3(c)(i)_ through _(iii)_ of
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may in its sole discretion withhold from any
distribution of the Escrow Property an amount of such distribution it
reasonably believes would, upon sale or liquidation, produce proceeds equal to
any unpaid amounts to which the Escrow Agent is entitled hereunder.

(b) _Indemnification_ : Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its employees,
officers and directors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for, hold each
Indemnified Party harmless from, and defend each Indemnified Party against,
any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages and expenses
of any nature incurred by the Escrow Agent arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder,
including but not limited to reasonable attorneys fees, tax liabilities
(other than income tax liabilities associated with the Escrow Agents fees),
any liabilities or damages that may result from any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation made in any tax certification provided to the Escrow Agent,
and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any
claim of liability, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost
and expense shall be caused by the Indemnified Partys own bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and agreement
to hold harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

7\. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of any disagreement among any of the
Interested Parties to this Agreement, or between any of them and any other
person, resulting in adverse claims or demands being made with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in
good faith, is in doubt as to any action it should take hereunder, the Escrow
Agent may, at its option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands and
refuse to take any other action hereunder, so long as such disagreement
continues or such doubt exists, and in any such event, the Escrow Agent shall
not be liable in any way or to any person for its failure or refusal to act,
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to so refuse to act and
refrain from acting until (i) the rights of all parties having or claiming an
interest in the Escrow Property or the Escrow Account shall have been fully
and finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, or all
differences and doubts shall have been resolved by agreement among all of the
Interested Parties, and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall, in the case of
adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction, have received a final
order, judgment or decree by such court of competent jurisdiction,
which order, judgment or decree is not subject to appeal, and in the case of
resolution of differences and doubts by agreement, have received a notice in
writing signed by an Authorized Person (as defined below) of each of the
Interested Parties setting forth in detail the agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall have the option, after 30  



 

A-6  calendar days notice to the Interested Parties of its intention to do so,
to file an action in interpleader requiring the Interested Parties hereto
to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the
Escrow Agent in connection with such proceeding shall be paid by, and be the
joint and several obligation of, the Interested Parties. The rights of the
Escrow Agent under this _Section 7_ are cumulative of all other rights which
it may have by law or otherwise.

8\. _Exclusive Benefit_. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement,
this Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and their respective permitted successors, and shall not be deemed to give,
either expressly or implicitly, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
to any other entity or person whatsoever. No party may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties except that the Escrow Agent may resign upon the terms
described in this Agreement.

9\. _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not
performing any act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of any
occurrence beyond its control (including, without limitation, any provision of
any present or future law or regulation or any act of any governmental
authority, any act of God or war or terrorism, or the unavailability of the
Federal Reserve Bank wire services or any electronic communication facility).

10\. _Resignation and Removal_.

(a) The Interested Parties may jointly remove the Escrow Agent at any time by
giving to the Escrow Agent thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice of
removal signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties. The
Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving to each of the Interested
Parties thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice of resignation.

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after giving the foregoing notice of
removal to the Escrow Agent or within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the foregoing notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the
Interested Parties shall jointly and promptly appoint a successor escrow
agent, enter into an agreement with such successor escrow agent in
substantially the form of this Agreement and give notice of such successor
escrow agent to the Escrow Agent. If a successor escrow agent has not accepted
such appointment by the end of such (i) 30-day period, in the case of the
Escrow Agents removal, or (ii) 30-day period, in the case of the Escrow
Agents resignation, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for
other appropriate relief.

(c) Upon receipt of notice of the identity of the successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall either deliver the Escrow Property then held hereunder to
the successor escrow agent, less the Escrow Agents fees, costs, expenses and
the value of other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent hereunder, or hold
such Escrow Property (or any portion thereof) pending distribution, until all
such fees, costs and expenses or the value of other obligations are paid to
it.



 

A-7 (d) Upon delivery of the Escrow Property to the successor escrow agent and to
an Interested Party, if applicable, the Escrow Agent shall have no further
duties, responsibilities or obligations hereunder. The removal or resignation
of the Escrow Agent shall not relieve the Escrow Agent of responsibility to
account to the Interested Parties for funds received by the Escrow Agent
prior to the effective date of such removal or resignation.

11\. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

(a) The parties agree (pursuant to section 5-1401 of the General Obligations
Law of the State of New York) that, to the extent such laws would otherwise
not apply, this Agreement (including this choice-of-law provision) and the
rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement shall be governed by,
construed in accordance with, and all controversies and disputes arising
under, in connection with or in relation to this Agreement shall be resolved
pursuant to, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made
and to be wholly performed in the State of New York.

(b) The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan, City, County and State of New York, for any proceedings commenced
regarding this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any interpleader
proceeding or proceeding for the appointment of a successor escrow agent the
Escrow Agent may commence pursuant to this Agreement. The parties irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of such courts for the determination of all issues
in such proceedings and irrevocably waive any objection to venue or
inconvenient forum for any proceeding brought in any such court.

(c) The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, and agree not to plead or claim, any right of immunity from
legal action, suit or proceeding, from setoff or counterclaim, from the
jurisdiction of any court, from service of process, from attachment upon or
prior to judgment, from attachment in aid of execution or judgment, from
execution of judgment, or from any other legal process or proceeding for the
giving of any relief or for the enforcement of any judgment, and consents to
such relief and enforcement against it, its assets and its revenues in any
jurisdiction, in each case with respect to any matter arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement.

(d) The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any right to trial by
jury with respect to any proceeding relating to this Agreement.

12\. _Instructions, Verification, Communications_.

(a) All instructions required under this Agreement shall be delivered to the
Escrow Agent in writing, in English, in facsimile form and, if so requested
by the Escrow Agent, an original, executed by an Authorized Person (as
hereinafter defined) of each of the Interested Parties or an entity acting on
its behalf. The identity of such Authorized Persons, as well as their  



 

A-8  specimen signatures, title, telephone number and e-mail address, shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent in the list of authorized signers form as set
forth on _Schedule B_ and shall remain in effect until the applicable
Interested Party, or an entity acting on its behalf, notifies Escrow Agent of
any change thereto (the person(s) so designated from time to time, the "
_Authorized Persons_ "). The Escrow Agent and the Interested Parties agree
that the above constitutes a commercially reasonable security procedure.

(b) In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing
at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by
telecopier, .pdf, e-mail, or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call back to the applicable
person(s) specified to the Escrow Agent from time to time by an Authorized
Person and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone
purporting to be the person(s) so designated. To ensure the accuracy of the
instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such call backs. If the
Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instruction, or is not satisfied in its
sole discretion with the verification it receives, it will not execute the
instruction until all issues have been resolved to its satisfaction. The
persons and telephone numbers for call backs may be changed only in writing,
signed by an Authorized Person, actually received and acknowledged by the
Escrow Agent. The Interested Parties to this Agreement acknowledge that these
security procedures for funds transfers are commercially reasonable.

(c) To help the U.S. government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens
an account. When an account is opened, the Escrow Agent will ask for
information that will allow the Escrow Agent to identify relevant parties. The
Interested Parties hereby acknowledge such information disclosure requirements
and agree to comply with all such information disclosure requests from time
to time from the Escrow Agent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any and all
email communications (both text and attachments) by or from the Escrow Agent
that the Escrow Agent deems to contain confidential, proprietary, and/or
sensitive information shall be encrypted. The recipient (the " _Email
Recipient_ ") of the encrypted email communication will be required to
complete a registration process. Instructions on how to register and/or
retrieve an encrypted message will be included in the first secure email sent
by the Escrow Agent to the Email Recipient. Additional information and
assistance on using the encryption technology can be found at Citibanks
Secure Email website at www.citigroup.com/citigroup/citizen/privacy/email.htm
or by calling (866) 535-2504 (in the U.S.) or (904) 954-6181.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 12(a)_- _(d)_ may be amended by the
Escrow Agent unilaterally upon notice to the Interested Parties.



 

A-9 13\. _Notices; Wiring Instructions_.

(a) Any notice permitted or required hereunder shall be in writing in English,
and shall be sent (i) by personal delivery, overnight delivery by
a recognized courier or delivery service, or (ii) mailed by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) confirmed
telecopy accompanied by mailing of the original on the same day by first class
mail, postage prepaid, in each case addressed to the address and person(s)

receipt by the Escrow Agent. Whenever under the terms hereof the time for

transfer pursuant to the following instructions (or by such method of payment
