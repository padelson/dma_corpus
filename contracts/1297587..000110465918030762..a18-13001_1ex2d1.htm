partner of the Surviving Partnership immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Company shall be the sole general partner of the Surviving
Partnership following the Company Merger Effective Time, entitling the

specified in the Company Merger Articles of Merger and the Company Merger
Certificate in accordance with the MRL and the DRULPA (such date and time

satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West
52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, or at such other time, date and place
as may be mutually agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the " _Closing

delay the Closing to a date that is on or prior to October 10, 2018 by giving
written notice to the Company (an " _Extension Notice_ ") at least two
Business Days immediately preceding the date that, but for such delivery of
such Extension Notice, would have been the Closing Date and (ii) if Parent has
delivered an Extension Notice, then Parent may, upon at least five Business
Days prior written notice to the Company, designate the Closing Date to occur
on a Business Day occurring on or prior to October 10, 2018 (such date, the "
_Designated Closing Date_ ") (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be
entitled to provide one or more additional Extension Notices to delay the
Closing to a date following such Designated Closing Date that is on or prior
to October 10, 2018, in which event the date specified in such additional
Extension Notice(s) shall be the Designated Closing Date); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if, on the Designated Closing Date, the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ are not satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), then the Closing shall occur
on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or on such other date as may be
mutually agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. In the event that Parent
elects to delay the Closing pursuant to the foregoing, all references to the

be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to

Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has any
obligation to contribute to or with respect to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has any direct or indirect liability

of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any present or contingent liability under Title IV of
ERISA, nor does any condition exist which would reasonably be expected to
result in any such liability.

 



 

(c) Correct and complete copies of the following documents, with respect to
each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan,
of which there are none) have been made available to Parent by the Company:

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates have performed all obligations required to be performed by
them under all Company Employee Benefit Plans; (ii) the Company Employee
Benefit Plans have been administered in compliance with their terms and the
requirements of applicable Laws; (iii) all contributions and premium payments
(including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) required to have been made under any of the Company Employee
Benefit Plans, including to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, have been made by the due date thereof, or, to the
extent not yet due, will have been paid, or accrued in accordance with GAAP,
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; (iv) there are no actions, suits,
arbitrations, investigations, audits or claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) filed, or to the Companys knowledge, threatened in writing with
respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan; (v) the Company and its ERISA

defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) for

 



      
 

 



 

any excise Tax or civil penalty, and (vi) none of the Company Employee Benefit
Plans provide for continuing post-employment health, life insurance coverage
or other welfare benefits for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), or similar state Law, or
except with respect to a contractual obligation to reimburse any premiums such
Person may pay in order to obtain health coverage under COBRA.

 



 

(e) Each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans which is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable opinion letter or determination letter from the IRS and, to the
Companys knowledge, there is no fact which would adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Employee Benefit Plan or the exemption of
such trust.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Mergers will (either alone or in combination with any
other event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of
compensation due, to any current or former Service Provider; (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Company Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment (including the funding of a
trust) or vesting of any compensation or benefits from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to any current or former Service Provider. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in _Section 3.11(f)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, no amount payable to any current or former
Service Provider (whether in cash or property or as a result of accelerated
vesting) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event) would be nondeductible under Section 280G of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligations
to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Taxes incurred by such Service Provider, including, but not
limited to, Taxes incurred under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or any
interest or penalty related thereto.

knowledge, threatened in writing by or on behalf of any employee or group of

the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing to be brought or filed,
with any Governmental Entity or arbitrator based on, arising out of, in
connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of
employment of any individual by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Section 3.13 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all income and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it and all such filed Tax Returns
are correct, complete and accurate in all material respects. All material
Taxes payable by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid or
adequately provided for in accordance with GAAP, and adequate reserves or
accruals for Taxes have been provided in accordance with GAAP with respect to
any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which Taxes
are not yet due and owing or for which Taxes are being contested in good
faith. No power of attorney with respect to any Tax matter is currently in
force.

 



 

(b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing in 2004, the year with
respect to which the Company first made the election to be treated as a REIT
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, through December 31, 2017, has been
organized and operated in conformity for qualification and taxation as a real
estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of
the Code, (ii) has operated, and will continue to operate, in such a manner so
as to enable it to qualify as a REIT from January 1, 2018 through the date of
the Company Merger Effective Time, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take
any action which would reasonably be expected to result in the Companys
failure to qualify as a REIT, and no

 



      
 

 



 

challenge to the Companys status or qualification as a REIT is pending or, to
the Companys knowledge, threatened in writing. _Section 3.13(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each Company Subsidiary and its
classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the date hereof.
Each entity that is listed in _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter as a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company has,
since the later of the date of its formation and the date on which the Company
acquired an interest in such entity, been treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Each entity that
is listed in _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as a
corporation has, since the later of the date of its formation or the date on
which the Company acquired an interest in such entity, been treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a REIT, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" pursuant
to Section 856(i) of the Code (a " _QRS_ ") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code (a " _TRS_ ") as set forth on such
schedule. Each entity that is listed in _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter as a REIT has been, since the date of its formation, treated
as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject
to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise result in any
"built-in gains" Tax under Section 337(d) of the Code and the applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder).

 



 

(c) Since January 1, 2013, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not
incurred (i) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code or Section 337(d) of the Code (and the applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder) or (ii) any other material liability for Taxes that
have become due and that have not been previously paid other than in the
ordinary course of business. Since January 1, 2013, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary (other than a TRS or any subsidiary of a TRS) has
engaged at any time in any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. Since January 1, 2013, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in
Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material
risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be
imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the Tax
Protection Agreements currently in force and there are no other Tax Protection

audit, examination, investigation or other proceeding is contemplated or
pending; (iii) has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material
Tax assessment or deficiency; (iv) has not received a request for waiver of
the time to assess any material Taxes, which request is still pending; (v) is
not contesting any liability for material Taxes before any Governmental
Entity; (vi) to the knowledge of the Company, is not subject to a claim or

a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or such Company

respects with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the

and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws,

IRS Forms W-2 and 1099 required thereof, and (iv) have collected and remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Entity all material sales and use Taxes, or

issued within the last four (4) years relating to any Taxes due from or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries: (i) has agreed to
make any material adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, (ii) has
any knowledge that the IRS has proposed, in writing, such an adjustment or a
change in accounting method with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (iii) has any application pending with the IRS or any other
Governmental Entity requesting permission for any change in accounting method.

 



 

(i) Neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has requested any extension of time within which to file
any income Tax Return, which income Tax Return has since not been filed.

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
indemnity, allocation or sharing agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement, other than (i) the Tax Protection Agreements listed in _Section
3.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) any agreement or arrangement
between the Company and any Company Subsidiary, and (iii) provisions in
commercial contracts not primarily relating to Taxes.

Letter a list of all Reportable Transactions in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has participated. Each of the Company and the Company

Reportable Transaction in which it has participated. Each of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have retained all documents and other
records pertaining to any Reportable Transaction in which it has participated,
including documents and other records listed in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(g) and any other documents and other records which are related to any
Reportable Transaction in which it has participated but not listed in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(g).

 



 

(l) In the past two (2) years, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution in which the parties to such distribution treated the
distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable.

 



 

(m) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) is or has ever been a
member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any state, local, or foreign Law), or as
a transferee or successor.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the fully
executed commitment letter dated May 6, 2018 (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_
"), between Parent and the other party thereto (the " _Equity Investor_ ")
pursuant to which the Equity Investor has committed, subject only to the terms
and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein on
the Closing Date (the " _Equity Financing_ ").

 



 

(b) Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and the performance in all material respects by the
Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this Agreement, at the
Closing Parent will have sufficient cash on hand to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and satisfy all of its obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any
fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the

(and will not be prior to the Closing or valid termination of this Agreement)
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified (or is contemplated to be amended, supplemented or modified) in any
respect. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to the Company,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of all the parties thereto,
enforceable against Parent and the Equity Investor in accordance with and
subject to its terms and conditions, except as enforceability may be limited
by the Bankruptcy and Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Exception. There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements
relating to the Equity Commitment Letter. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach by
Parent under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Equity Commitment
Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable on the date on which the Closing should occur
pursuant to _Section 1.5_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, the performance in all material
respects by the Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this
Agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, Parent does not have any reason to believe
that it or the Equity Investor would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter required to be satisfied
by Parent or the Equity Investor, as applicable. Parent has paid in full any
and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Equity Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
investing of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parents, Merger Sub Is or Merger Sub
IIs obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered the Guaranty to the Company. The Guaranty is in full
force and effect, has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect, and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with and subject to its terms and conditions, except as enforceability may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on
the part of the Guarantor under such Guaranty. The provisions of this _Section
4.9_ do not limit the express representations of the Guarantor contained in
the Guaranty.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to consummate the Mergers have been
satisfied or waived, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ are true and correct, and (c) the financial projections or
forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been
prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable,
then at and immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time and after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the funding of the Equity Financing, Parent, the Surviving Company
and each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, including the Surviving
Partnership, will be Solvent. Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are not

as they may establish; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Parent and its affiliates shall not conduct any
environmental investigation at any Company Real Property involving sampling or
other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or
anything else at or in connection with any Company Real Property; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing
so would be reasonably likely to (i) result in a risk of loss or waiver of
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or other legal privilege,

respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene
or violate any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is

entered into between the Company and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P.,
dated April 10, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall
continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding clause (i) of Section 16
thereof; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives may disclose
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) subject to the
confidentiality restrictions applicable to "Representatives" (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement to
(i) potential purchasers (and their financing sources) of the Specified
Properties or Company Subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own such
Specified Properties and (ii) Parents potential Lenders as permitted by
_Section 5.17(c)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to the
preceding clause (i), (A) such potential purchasers (and their financing
sources) shall not use any such Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) other than in connection with their consideration, evaluation,

 



       
 

 



 

negotiation, financing and if applicable, consummation of such a transaction,
(B) Parent will not require any such potential purchasers to, and Parent shall
require that any such potential purchasers (and their affiliates) not, enter
into any exclusivity, lock-up or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding, whether written or oral, with any financing source without the
prior written consent of the Company that may reasonably be expected to limit,
restrict, restrain or otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly,
the ability of such financing source to provide financing or other assistance
to any other Person in respect of a Company Acquisition Proposal (provided
that the foregoing shall not prohibit the establishment of customary "tree"
arrangements) and (C) Parent will not restrict any such potential purchasers
from engaging in discussions or entering into agreements with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis with respect to potential transactions involving

whom Parent has furnished Information.

supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and, after consultation with,
and approval by, Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain and furnish the information required to
be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, and respond, after consultation
with Parent, promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement, and (ii) promptly upon the earlier of (A) receiving
notification that the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement and
(B) the conclusion of any SEC review of the preliminary Proxy Statement, cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders and,
if necessary, after the definitive Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed,
promptly circulate amended or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in
connection therewith, resolicit proxies; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
amended or supplemental proxy materials will be filed with the SEC or mailed
by the Company without affording Parent a reasonable opportunity for
consultation and review, and the Company shall consider in good faith any
comments on such materials reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company will
promptly notify Parent of the receipt of comments from the SEC and of any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the preliminary Proxy
Statement or definitive Proxy Statement or for additional information, and
will promptly supply Parent with copies of all written correspondence between
the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement,
the definitive Proxy Statement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to responding to any comments of the SEC
or members of its staff, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to consult and review such response and the Company shall consider
in good faith any comments on such response reasonably proposed by Parent.
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II will cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including promptly
furnishing to the Company any and all information regarding Parent, Merger Sub
I and Merger Sub II and their respective affiliates as may be required to be
disclosed therein. The Proxy Statement shall contain the Company
Recommendation, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, as permitted by and determined in
accordance with _Section 5.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting any event or
circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers, trustees or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to
the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly inform the other party hereto, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Companys shareholders.
All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Mergers will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for
mailing to the Companys shareholders in accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of the
Company Shares (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of
seeking the Company Requisite Vote. The Company, through the Company Board,
shall recommend to holders of the Company Shares that they vote in favor of
the Company Merger so that the Company may obtain the Company Requisite Vote
(the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Company Requisite Vote (including by soliciting proxies
from the Companys shareholders), except in each case to the extent that the
Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, as
permitted by and determined in accordance with _Section 5.6_. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting after consultation with Parent (A) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the holders of Company Shares within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of a vote on the Company Merger or (B) if additional
time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the
Company Merger; _provided_ , that, in the case of this clause (B), without the
written consent of Parent, in no event shall the Company Shareholders Meeting
(as so postponed or adjourned) be held on a date that is more than thirty (30)
days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally
scheduled. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_, the obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and mail the Proxy
Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto that may be required by
Law) to the Companys shareholders shall not be affected by an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

Each party hereto will have the right to review in advance, and each party
will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good
faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in writing to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto
will use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Mergers as promptly as
practicable and to cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its
obligations under this Agreement, including, consistent with the foregoing,
(i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable, with the objective of
being in a position to consummate the Mergers as promptly as practicable
following the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, all documentation to
effect all necessary or advisable applications, notices, petitions, filings,
and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings,
authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
Governmental Entity or third party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any that are required to be obtained
under any federal, state or local Law or Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties
or assets are bound, (ii) defending all lawsuits or other legal proceedings
against it or any of its affiliates relating to or challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Mergers (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and (iii)
effecting all necessary or advisable registrations and other filings required
under the Exchange Act or any other federal, state or local Law relating to
the Mergers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from any Person (other than from a Governmental
Entity) (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation and (ii) none of
Parent or any of its affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligations. In the event that any party fails to obtain any such consent, the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse
effect upon the Company and Parent and their respective affiliates and
businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such
consent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably informed regarding any
Transaction Litigation unless doing so would, in the reasonable judgment of
such party, jeopardize any privilege of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent in
writing of the initiation of and any material developments regarding, and
shall reasonably consult with and permit Parent and its Representatives to
participate in the defense, negotiations or settlement of, any Transaction
Litigation, and the Company shall give consideration to Parents advice with
respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not
permit any Company Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives to,
compromise or settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary so that
no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary so that the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on Parent, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of the Company Shares and the
Company Series A Preferred Shares from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly
as practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time and the Company Series
A Preferred Share Redemption and the deregistration of the Company Shares and
the Company Series A Preferred Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Adverse Recommendation
Change_ _._

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.6_, (i) from and after
the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers, trustees and
directors to, and shall direct its and their other Representatives to,
immediately cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) during the Interim Period, the Company agrees
that it shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its
and their officers, trustees and directors not to, and shall not authorize and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry,
discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (B)
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any third
party any non-public information in connection with, or knowingly facilitate
in any way any effort by,

 



      
 

 



 

any third party in furtherance of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry,
(C) approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, (D) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset
purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company or the Partnership to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (any of the foregoing referred in this clause (D), an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (E) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the Companys compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.6_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, through any Representative,
in response to an unsolicited written _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal
by a third party made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 5.6_, it being agreed that the Company Board
may correspond in writing with any Person making such a written Company
Acquisition Proposal to request clarification of the terms and conditions
thereof so as to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal),
(i) furnish non-public information to such third party (and such third partys
Representatives) making such a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
no more favorable in any material respect to such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement (taking into account any consents or waivers
provided thereunder to allow the disclosure of information to financing
sources and/or teaming arrangements) (such confidentiality agreement, an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to
such third party (or its Representatives) shall, to the extent not previously
provided to Parent, be provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after
providing it to such third party (and in any event within 48 hours
thereafter)), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such third
party (and such third partys Representatives) with respect to the Company
Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48
hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has
made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other Inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company regarding a
possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made in writing
and shall identify the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or
Inquiry and indicate the material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries, to the extent known (including, if
applicable, providing copies of any written Company Acquisition Proposals or
Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto, which may be redacted
to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or
operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry).
The Company shall also promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify
Parent, in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations

 



      
 

 



 

concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information
to any Person in each case in accordance with _Section 5.6(b)_, notify Parent
of any change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry on a
reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all written
proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or correspondence relating
thereto. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any confidential or similar agreement that would
prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.6(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company Recommendation,
(ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the actions described in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 5.6(d)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (iv) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree
to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or
cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.6_).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may (A)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if an Intervening Event has occurred
and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law,
or (B) if the Company is not in breach of this _Section 5.6_, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_, in each case in this clause (B), in response to an
unsolicited written _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Parent pursuant to, _Section 5.6(e)_ and such Company Acquisition Proposal is
not withdrawn.

 



 

(e) The Company Board shall only be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ as permitted under _Section 5.6(d)_ if (i) the Company has
provided a prior written notice (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ ")
to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, identifying the Person
making the Superior Proposal and describing the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the
basis of such action, including, if applicable, copies of any written
proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to a Superior
Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of
Recommendation by the Company shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents
receipt of the Notice of Change of Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change
Period_ "), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal
ceases to

 



      
 

 



 

constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an Intervening Event, in
order to obviate the need to make such Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(iii) following the end of the Notice of Change Period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of
Recommendation or otherwise, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Change of Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation, and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 5.6(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , the Notice of Change Period shall
be reduced to two (2) Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such
new Notice of Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company that is required by applicable Law or if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the trustees duties under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it
being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop,
look and listen" or similar statement of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor
the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend that the shareholders of the
Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange
offer that is a Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section
5.6(d)_.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, except solely to allow the applicable party to make a non-public
Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board or to allow the disclosure
of information to financing sources and/or teaming arrangements. The Company
and the Company Board shall not take any actions to exempt any person from the
"Common Share Ownership Limit" or "Preferred Share Ownership Limit" or
establish or increase an "Excepted Holder Limit," as such terms are defined in
the Company Charter unless such actions are taken concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(c)(i)_.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without
the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public

 



      
 

 



 

statement (a) as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release
or making such public statement has provided the other party with an
opportunity to review and comment (and the parties shall cooperate as to the
timing and contents of any such press release or public statement) upon any
such press release or public statement or (b) containing statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Mergers that are substantially similar to
those in the Proxy Statement or in previous press releases or public
statements made by the Company or Parent in accordance with this _Section
5.7_; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such consultation or consent shall be
required with respect to any release, communication, announcement or public
statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with _this Agreement_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Trustees  and Officers Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
current or former trustee, director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims,
actions, suits, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next
sentence, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Company Merger Effective Time), including in connection with
the consideration, negotiation and approval of this Agreement, to the extent
that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a
trustee, director, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans, including payment
on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or
arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective
Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights
under this _Section 5.8_; _provided_ , that (x) none of the Surviving Company
or the Surviving Partnership shall be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (y) except for legal counsel engaged for
one or more Indemnified Parties on the date hereof, none of the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be obligated under this _Section
5.8(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected
by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to
the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Partys counsel, two or
more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage
or liability (whether or not asserted before the Company Merger Effective
Time), the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable,
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days, after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified
Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

incurred ( _provided_ that, if legally required, the person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined
by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under applicable
Law).

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the Companys
officers and trustees liability insurance policies in effect on the date
hereof (accurate and complete copies of which have been previously provided to
Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Surviving Company may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts with reputable and
financially sound carriers containing terms no less advantageous to such
former trustees or officers so long as such substitution does not result in
gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring on or prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to pay annual premiums in
the aggregate of more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to
maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided further_
that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall procure and maintain for such six-year period the most
advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the Maximum Amount. In
lieu of the foregoing, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall have the option to cause coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO
Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy or policies on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the Companys existing DandO Insurance,
subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this _Section
5.8(b)_, and such "tail" policy or policies shall satisfy the provisions of
this _Section 5.8(b)_.

 



 

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section
5.8_ shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Mergers and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_, each of whom (including
his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her Representatives,
successors and assigns) may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.8_)
without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors,
assigns and heirs of such Indemnified Party) affected thereby. In the event
that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person,
or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(d) For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership shall
provide to the Indemnified Parties the same rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided to the Indemnified
Parties under the provisions of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
declaration of trust, charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents as
in effect as of the date hereof, and the Surviving Companys and the Surviving
Partnerships

 



      
 

 



 

declaration of trust, charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents
shall not contain any provisions inconsistent with such rights. The
contractual indemnification rights set forth in _Section 5.8(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter in existence on the date of this Agreement with any
of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Company and the
Surviving Partnership without any further action, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Company Merger
Effective Time.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section 5.8_, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to trustees and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.8_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and for the period ending
on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if shorter,
during any applicable period of employment), Parent shall provide or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, to each individual who was employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ "), (i) a base salary or wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate in
effect with respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less
favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, and (iii)
other compensation and benefits (including severance benefits, paid-time off,
and health insurance, but excluding equity-based compensation and long-term
incentive compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause its designated Subsidiary to, assume and honor the terms of the
severance arrangements set forth in _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, without amendment, in accordance with the terms of _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The foregoing shall not require that
any Company Employee remain employed for any period after Closing nor that any
compensation or benefits be provided after a Company Employee ceases to be
employed (other than vested rights and benefits in effect at the time of such
cessation of employment and the severance benefits set forth in _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter). For the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing any benefits to any Company Employee
after the Company Merger Effective Time (the " _Parent Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors as if such service were
with Parent or an applicable Subsidiary, provided that the foregoing shall not
apply for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or to
the extent the Company did not provide such service credit under any
comparable plan, program or benefit.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries as the case may be, to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, actively at
work requirements, waiting periods or any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Company Employee with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees
and their dependents under any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that such
Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date,
other than limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods or other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the extent such
evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Company
Employees under the comparable Company Employee Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Closing, and (iii) provide each such Company Employee and his or
her dependents with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles satisfied
prior to the Closing Date for the plan year within which the Company Merger
Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements, and for any lifetime maximums, under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall honor all Company Employee Benefit Plans and compensation
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (subject to any rights
to amend or modify such Company Employee Benefit Plans and compensation
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms).

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.6_, no provision of this
_Section 5.9_, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
(including any Company Employee and any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
(ii) shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company
Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) is intended to
prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any
Company Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date
or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Dividends_. During the Interim Period, the Company and any
Company Subsidiary that is a REIT may make distributions to its shareholders
and the Partnership may make distributions to the Company to allow the Company
to make distributions to its shareholders, in each case (a) reasonably
necessary for the Company or any such Company Subsidiary to (i) maintain its

Section 5.12 _Other Transactions; Parent-Approved Transactions_. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation and
assistance as Parent may reasonably request to (a) convert or cause the
conversion of one or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries that are organized
as corporations into limited liability companies and one or more Company
Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships into limited liability
companies, on the basis of organizational documents as reasonably requested by

liability company interests or other equity interests owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company in one or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries at
a price and on such other terms as designated by Parent, (c) exercise any

terminated any Contract to which the Company or a wholly-owned Company
Subsidiary is a party and (d) sell or cause to be sold any of the assets of
the Company or one or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries at a price and on
such other terms as designated by Parent (any action or transaction described

that (i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action in contravention of (A) any organizational

Material Contract, or (C) applicable Law, (ii) any such conversions, exercises
of any rights of termination or other terminations, sales or transactions,
including the consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction or other

_Article VI_ having been satisfied (or, with respect to _Section 6.2_,
waived) and receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent to such
effect and that Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are prepared to proceed
immediately with the Closing and any other evidence reasonably requested by
the Company that the Closing will occur (it being understood that in any event
the transactions described in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) will be deemed to
have occurred prior to the Closing), (iii) such actions (or the inability to

action that could adversely affect the classification of the Company, or any
Company Subsidiary that is classified as a REIT, as a REIT or could subject
the Company or any such Subsidiary to any "prohibited transactions" Taxes or
other material Taxes under Code Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 (or other
material entity-level Taxes) and (v) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action that could result in any
United States federal, state or local income Tax being imposed on any holder
of Partnership Units other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Such
actions or transactions shall be undertaken in the manner (including in the
order) specified by Parent and, subject to the limits set forth above and
except as agreed by Parent and the Company, such actions or transactions shall
be implemented immediately prior to or concurrent with the Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to,
or be deemed to be breached or violated by, the transactions or cooperation
contemplated by this _Section 5.12_. The Company shall not be deemed to have
made an Adverse Recommendation Change or entered into or agreed to enter an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement as a result of providing any cooperation or
taking any actions to the extent requested by Parent in connection with a
Parent-Approved Transaction. The consummation of any Parent-Approved
Transaction shall not constitute consummation of a Company Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_, nor shall any Company
Acquisition Proposal made in respect of a Parent-Approved Transaction
constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section
7.3(b)(iii)_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this _Section

any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in the event the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated,
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries not previously
reimbursed).

 



 

Section 5.13 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) _REIT Matters_. The Company shall take all reasonable actions as the
Company determines are reasonably necessary to ensure that the Company and any
Company Subsidiary that is a REIT (i) will qualify for taxation as a REIT for
U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year and, if the
Closing Date occurs in 2019, its 2019 taxable year, and (ii) will not become
liable for U.S. federal income Tax under Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code.
During the Interim Period, the Company shall cooperate and consult in good
faith with Parent with respect to maintenance of the REIT status of the
Company (and any Company Subsidiary that is a REIT) for the Companys 2018
taxable year and, if the Closing Date occurs in 2019, the Companys 2019
taxable year.

 



 

(b) _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall, upon written request,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other

efforts to obtain and deliver to Merger Sub I at or prior to the Partnership
Merger a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as of the

any Company Subsidiary), substantially in the form of the sample certification
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B), as
applicable.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
value added, stock transfer, stamp or similar Taxes, and any transfer,
recording, registration and other similar fees that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer
Taxes_ "). From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving

any consideration or amounts payable to holders of Company Shares, Company
Series A Preferred Shares or Partnership Units, all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Preferred Share Redemptions_.

or notices of redemption (the " _Series A Redemption Notice_") pursuant to
Section 6 of the Articles Supplementary classifying the Company Series A
Preferred Shares (the " _Series A Articles Supplementary_") to the holders of
record of Company Series A Preferred Shares. The Series A Redemption Notices
shall be prepared by the Company and shall comply with the specifications and
timing requirement of the Series A Articles Supplementary and be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and shall state that each Company
Series A Preferred Share held by such holder immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time shall be redeemed by the Company effective as of the
Closing Date, with the redemption price per share equal to an amount in cash
equal to Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if
any, to, but not including, the Closing Date (including any amounts
contemplated by Section 6(d) of the Articles Supplementary), without interest
(such amount, the " _Per Company Series A Preferred Share Redemption
Price_"), with such redemption subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing (the " _Company Series A Preferred Share Redemption_"). The
Series A Redemption Notices shall include the other information required by
the Series A Articles Supplementary. Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Company Series A Preferred Share
Redemption Price for the redemption of the Company Series A Preferred Shares

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 5.15_. The aggregate amount of cash payable to
holders of Company Series A Preferred Shares in the Company Series A Preferred
Share Redemption is herein referred to as the " _Aggregate Preferred Share
Redemption Amount_."

 



 

(b) In connection with the Company Series A Preferred Share Redemption, the
Partnership shall redeem, effective as of the Closing Date, each of the
Partnership Preferred Units held by the Company at a redemption price equal to
the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Redemption Price, subject to and

Preferred Share Redemption.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Cooperation Regarding Existing Loans_.

 



 

(a) Promptly following Parents request, the Company shall deliver to each of
the lenders under mortgage or mezzanine debt of any of the Company
Subsidiaries (any such debt, " _Subject Mortgage Debt_ ") or any agent or
trustee acting on their behalf (each an " _Existing Lender_ "), a notice
prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by the Company,
requesting that such Existing Lender deliver to Parent and the Company a
written statement or documents (the " _Assumption Documents_ ") (i) confirming

Mortgage Debt that Parent may reasonably request after the date hereof;
_provided_ that the Company shall be informed of any such request or
modification; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event Parent requests
Assumption Documents in accordance with this _Section 5.16_, (x) the
consummation of the Mergers shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or
postponed as a result of the receipt of (or failure to receive) such
Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the Existing Lenders and (y)
the Assumption Documents will be effective as of or immediately prior to and
conditioned on the occurrence of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.
Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any indebtedness that
Parent intends not to repay or not to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repay at the Closing, the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with
maintaining such continuing indebtedness. In furtherance of the foregoing, at
the option of Parent, Parent shall have the right to discuss with any such
lender maintaining the indebtedness (provided that the Company is provided a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the discussions and Parent shall
provide the Company with updates on the status of discussions upon the
Companys reasonable request) and make all determinations and decisions
regarding such indebtedness from and after the Closing and any payment of
costs or fees relating thereto from or after the Closing. The Companys
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 5.17_.

 



 

(b) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in connection with the
Assumption Documents, including premiums for any endorsements to or re-date of
the title insurance policy previously issued to the Existing Lenders,

sentence if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are
actually obtained or provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in
_Section 5.16_, nothing herein shall require the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to take any
action pursuant to _Section 5.16_ or this _Section 5.17_ to the extent it
would (1) unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (2) except with respect to delivery of
the notice specified in the first sentence of clause (a) of _Section 5.16_,
or _clauses (v)_ , _(vii)_ and _(viii)_ of this _Section 5.17(a)_, require
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or
officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (other than directors or
officers who will continue to be directors or officers following the

_Section 5.17(a)_,

 



      
 

 



 

have any obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under

access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in
this clause (7)) or (8) prepare any financial statements or information that
are not reasonably available to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
prepared in the ordinary course of their financial reporting practice, or
prepare any pro forma financial information or post-closing financial
information. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.17(a)_ or otherwise shall
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing,
to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. None of
the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any
of the actions taken by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.17(a)_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable legal
fees and disbursements) incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.16_ or this _Section 5.17(a)_ and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically in connection with their
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.17(a)_).

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in _Sections 5.16_ and _5.17(a)_ represent the sole
obligation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with any
indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Subject Mortgage
Debt) or the arrangement of any modifications thereto, or the arrangement of
any financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) to
be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to
expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their
respective affiliates or any other financing or other transactions (including
any consents, waivers, amendments or other modifications with respect to
indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) be a condition to
any of Parents, Merger Sub Is or Merger Sub IIs obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) All nonpublic or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or their
respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.17_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company agrees that Parent and its
Representatives may initiate contact with and pursue potential Lenders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions applicable to
"Representatives" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Parent and its affiliates and its and their
Representatives to the extent acting on behalf of Parent will not enter into
with any such potential Lenders any exclusivity, lock-up or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, that may reasonably be
expected to limit, restrict, restrain or otherwise impair in any manner,
directly or indirectly, the ability of such potential Lender to provide
financing or other assistance to any other Person in respect of a Company
Acquisition Proposal (provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
establishment of customary "tree" arrangements).

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
order, decree or ruling or taking of such other action was primarily due to
the failure of the Company or the Partnership, in the case of termination by

termination by Parent, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

Merger Sub II fail to consummate the Closing on or before the third Business
Day after delivery of the notice referenced in clause (B) of this _Section

(d) by written notice from Parent to the Company, if:

 



 

(i) the Company or the Partnership shall have breached or failed to perform

obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Company or
the Partnership or their respective affiliates or Representatives, relating
to, based on or arising under or out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the subject matter hereof (including the negotiation
and performance of this Agreement), except (a) as provided in _Section
5.2(b)_ and for this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_, the
provisions relating to the payment and reimbursement of Assumption Expenses in
_Section 5.16(b)_ and the indemnification, payment and reimbursement
provisions contained in the last sentence of _Section 5.12_ and the last
sentence of _Section 5.17(a)_, (b) the Guaranty and the Confidentiality
Agreement ( _provided_ that with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement,

shall each continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms (notwithstanding clause (i) of Section 16 of the
Confidentiality Agreement) and (c) subject to _Section 8.8_, nothing herein
shall relieve any party from any liability for any fraud or any willful and
intentional breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses._

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether or not the
Mergers are consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_,

 



 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_, or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and
(B)(x) a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been received by the Company
or its Representatives or any Person shall have publicly proposed or publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal (and, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_, such Company Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposed or
announced intention shall have been made prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting) and (y) within twelve (12) months after a termination referred to in
this _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_ the Company enters into a definitive agreement
relating to, or consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (with, for
purposes of this clause (y), the references to "15%" in the definition of
"Company Acquisition Proposal" being deemed to be references to "50%"),

 



 

then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Company Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, (x) in
the case of a payment pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(i)_, within two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination by Parent, (y) in the case of
a payment pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_, prior to or concurrently with
such termination by the Company and (z) in the case of a payment pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)(iii)_, within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of
entry into a definitive agreement relating to the Company Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (y) of _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_, or the consummation of,
such Company Acquisition Proposal. " _Company Termination Fee_ " means
$138,000,000, except that the Company Termination Fee shall be $46,000,000 in
the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement with an
Excluded Party providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ , then Parent shall, within
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be
paid to the Company, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by the Company, an amount equal to $414,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Amount_ ").

 



 

(d) If the Company decides to apply for a ruling from the IRS with respect to
the tax consequences of the receipt of the Parent Termination Amount, Parent
shall cooperate with the Company and use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide assistance (if any) requested by the Company with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that (x) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (y)
the Parent Termination Amount is not a penalty, but rather is the amount that
Parent has agreed to pay the Company, upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Parents breach or other failure to consummate the Mergers
pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, for release from its
agreement and settlement of its obligation to consummate the Mergers (and
acquire, for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local, income tax
purposes, all of the Companys assets) in accordance herewith and compensates
the Company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Mergers. If Parent receives the full
payment of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the
receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered by Parent, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives
in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination. In the event that Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, is required to commence litigation to seek
all or a portion of the amounts payable under this _Section 7.3_, and it
prevails in such litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in addition to
all amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this _Section
7.3_, all reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) which it has
incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder. The parties agree that in no event
shall (i) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Amount on more than
one occasion or (ii) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

behalf of itself or its property, in the manner provided by _Section 8.3_,

Section 8.5 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, exhibit or schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an exhibit or schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated.
The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." All
terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in
any certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

References to a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Parties In Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns, and, except as provided in _Section 5.8_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 5.8_ shall not arise
unless and until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver
by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.10_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Company or the Partnership do not perform any of the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in accordance with the Agreements specified terms or
otherwise breaches such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or
remedy a breach of this Agreement by the Company and the Partnership and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II are entitled at Law or
in equity. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief on the basis that any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II has an
adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any of Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent a
breach or

 



      
 

 



 

breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with the request for or grant of any such order or injunction.
Each of the Company and the Partnership agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy. The parties hereto agree that neither the Company nor the
Partnership shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof and that the Companys and the Partnerships sole and
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub
I or Merger Sub II or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in _Section
7.3(c)_, as set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 7.3(e)_,
payment or reimbursement of Assumption Expenses pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)_, and indemnification, payment and reimbursement pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section 5.12_ and the last sentence of _Section 5.17(a)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to prevent any breach by Parent of _Section 5.2(b)_ or _Section
7.3(d)_.

 



 

(b) The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to _Section
8.8(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement,
including under _Section 7.3_, in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in _Section 8.8(a)_
are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any of Parents, Merger Sub Is or Merger Sub IIs
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 8.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any legal proceeding by any of Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II seeking remedies pursuant to _Section 8.8(a)_ or anything set
forth in this _Section 8.8_ restrict or limit Parents right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II together for any
losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company or the Partnership or their
affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, shall be limited to an amount equal to
(i) the Parent Termination Amount, plus (ii) amounts payable or reimbursable
pursuant to the penultimate sentence of _Section 7.3(e)_, plus (iii) the
aggregate amount of Assumption Expenses payable or reimbursable pursuant to
_Section 5.16(b)_, plus (iv) Parents indemnification, payment and
reimbursement obligations pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 5.12_ and
the last sentence of _Section 5.17(a)_ (collectively, the " _Liability
Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the Company or the Partnership or any of
their affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract,

 



       
 

 



 

tort or otherwise. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it has
no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any
of the Parent Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to the
extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. to
the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but
not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty
and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Partnership and their respective
affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Party (other than

and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company
against Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II hereunder and Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors L.P. under the Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall
the Company or its affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from,
any Parent Party (other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the
Guaranty and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations
described therein).

 



 

Section 8.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II at any time
before or after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite Vote but,
after such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of
any such shareholders under applicable Law without obtaining such further
approvals. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any breaches or
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) subject to _Section 8.9_, waive compliance by the other parties
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II in exercising
any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall be considered

 



      
 

 



 

one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf
format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

by the General Partner in its sole discretion, out of Available Cash,
quarterly in arrears on the last calendar day (or, if such day is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding day that is a Business Day) of each March,
June, September and December of each year (each a " _Distribution Payment
Date_ "), commencing on the first such date after the Closing Date. The period
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the first Distribution
Payment Date, and each subsequent period from and including a Distribution
Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Distribution Payment Date,
is hereinafter called a " _Distribution Period_ ". Distributions shall be
payable to holders of Series B Preferred Units of record as they appear in the
books and records of the Partnership at the close of business on the
applicable record date (each, a " _Record Date_ "), which shall be the 15th
day of the calendar month in which the applicable Distribution Payment Date
falls or such other date designated by the General Partner for the payment of
distributions on the Series B Preferred Units that is not more than thirty
(30) nor less than ten (10) days prior to such Distribution Payment Date. The
amount of any distribution payable for any Distribution Period, or portion
thereof, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months.

 



 

(ii) Distributions on the Series B Preferred Units which are due but unpaid
will accumulate quarterly, whether or not there is sufficient Available Cash
for such distributions, whether or not the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for
the payment of such distributions and whether or not such distributions are
authorized. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series B Preferred Units
will accumulate as of the Distribution Payment Date on which they first become
payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Partnership shall make quarterly distributions of cash (the " _Tax Liability
Distributions_ ") to the holders of Series B Preferred Units, as distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units, in an amount sufficient to enable such
holders to pay, on a quarterly basis, U.S. federal, state and local income
taxes arising from the allocations made (or estimated to be made) to such
holders with respect to the cash distributions to such holder pursuant to this
Section 2.B. of this Exhibit G, to the extent that distributions otherwise
paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Units in such quarter and prior
quarters in such fiscal year are not sufficient for such holders to pay such
taxes, which payments shall be made within thirty (30) days after the close of
each applicable quarter. Subject to the following sentence, the amount of any
such Tax Liability Distribution shall equal the product of (x) the highest
marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate applicable to
an individual holder of Series B Preferred Units residing in New York (after
giving effect to income tax deductions (if allowable) for state and local
income taxes and the character of the applicable income) for such fiscal
period and (y) the aggregate amounts of net taxable income or gain of the
Partnership that were actually allocated or are estimated to be allocated to
such holder for federal income tax purposes for such fiscal period and any
prior fiscal period with respect to the cash distributions made to such holder
pursuant to this Section 2.B of this Exhibit G (only to the extent no Tax
Liability Distribution or other distribution was previously made with respect
to such fiscal period). For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax Liability
Distributions shall reduce the amount of any accrued but unpaid distributions
with respect to the Series B Preferred Units.

 



 

(iii) If any Series B Preferred Units are outstanding, if and so long as the
Partnership is in arrears with regard to the payment of any distributions upon
the Series B Preferred Units in respect of any completed Distribution Period,
(a) no distributions (other than distributions made in Series B Junior Units
(as defined below) or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase
Series B Junior Units) shall be authorized or paid or set apart for payment
nor shall any other distribution be authorized or made upon any Series B
Junior Units unless distributions sufficient to make up such arrearage shall
have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart in a separate account of the
Partnership for payment for all past Distribution Periods, and (b) no Series B
Junior Units shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund
for the redemption of Series B Junior Units) by the Partnership (except by
conversion into or exchange for Series B Junior Units or options, warrants or
rights to subscribe for or purchase Series B Junior Units).

 



 

(iv) If any Series B Preferred Units are outstanding, if and so long as
distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment
is not so set apart) upon the Series B Preferred Units and all other
Partnership Interests ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Units as
to distributions, all distributions authorized upon the Series B Preferred
Units shall be authorized and paid pro rata so that the amount of
distributions authorized and paid per Series B Preferred Unit and any such
other Partnership Interest shall in all cases bear to each other the same
ratio that accumulated distributions per Series B Preferred Unit and any such
other Partnership Interest bear to each other. No interest shall be payable in
respect of any distribution payment or payments on Series B Preferred Units
which may be in arrears.

 



 

(v) No distributions on the Series B Preferred Units shall be authorized by
the General Partner or paid or set apart for payment by the Partnership at
such times as any agreement of the Partnership, including any agreement
relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting
apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting
apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder,
or if such authorization or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) Holders of Series B Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any
distribution, whether payable in cash, property or Partnership Interests in
excess of full cumulative distributions on the Series B Preferred Units as
described above and the liquidation preference set forth in _Section 2.C_ of
this _Exhibit G_. Any distribution authorized on the Series B Preferred Units
shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid
distribution due with respect to such Series B Preferred Units which remains
unpaid.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as (a) the
Partnership is not in arrears with regard to the payment of any distributions
upon the Series B Preferred Units in respect of any completed Distribution
Period and (b) the Partnership shall have made all redemption payments then
due to be paid to holders of the Series B Preferred Units under _Section 2.D_
of this _Exhibit G_, the Partnership shall be permitted at any time to make
cash distributions and distributions in-kind of assets, properties or
securities to holders of Partnership Interests other than Series B Preferred
Units, and the holders of Series B Preferred Units shall not be entitled to
participate in any such distributions.

 



 

C. _Liquidation Preference_

 



 

(i) Upon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the affairs of the Partnership, before any distribution or payment shall be
made to holders of Series B Junior Units, notwithstanding anything in the
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 13.02_ of the Agreement, each
holder of Series B Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive and be paid
out of the assets of the Partnership legally available for distribution to the
Partners pursuant to the Agreement a liquidation preference per Series B
Preferred Unit equal to _[$27.50 plus amount of Additional Consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ , plus an amount equal to any accrued and
unpaid distributions to but excluding the date of payment on the Series B
Preferred Units held by such holder.

 



 

(ii) In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up, the legally available assets of the Partnership are
insufficient to pay the full amount of the liquidating distributions on all
outstanding Series B Preferred Units and all other Partnership Interests
ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Units as to the liquidating
distributions, then such assets shall be allocated pro rata among the holders
of Series B Preferred Units and any such other Partnership Interest so that
the amount of liquidating distributions paid per Series B Preferred Unit and
any such other Partnership Interest shall in all cases bear to each other the
same ratio that liquidating distributions to which holders of Series B
Preferred Unit and any such other Partnership Interest would otherwise
respectively be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.C.(i)_ of this _Exhibit G_
and the Agreement.

 



 

(iii) After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.C.(i)_ of this _Exhibit G_,
the holders of Series B Preferred Units, as such, will have no right or claim
to any of the remaining assets of the Partnership, shall cease to be Partners
in respect of such Series B Preferred Units and the Series B Preferred Units
shall be deemed cancelled.

 



 

(iv) The consolidation or merger of the Partnership with or into any other
partnership, corporation, trust or entity or of any other partnership,
corporation, trust or other entity with or into the Partnership or the sale,
lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of, the property or business
of the Partnership, shall not be deemed to constitute a dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Partnership for purposes of this _Section
2.C_ of this _Exhibit G_.

 



 

D. _Redemption at Holder s Option for Cash_

 



 

(i) Commencing on the earlier of (a) the date the amount of "Total Capital" as
reflected in the Partnerships unaudited consolidated balance sheets for a
calendar quarter is less than $100 million (a

 



       
 

 



 

" _Total Capital Shortfall Event_ ") and (b) December 31, 2019 (or at any
earlier time that the Partnership is a Subsidiary of a Person that is subject
to taxation as a REIT with Publicly Traded common stock, or upon the earlier
death of a holder of Series B Preferred Units, solely in respect of such
holders estate), each holder of Series B Preferred Units (or such deceased
holders estate only, as applicable) shall have the right (the " _Preferred
Redemption Right_ ") to require the Partnership to redeem on the Preferred
Redemption Date (as defined below) all or any portion of the Series B
Preferred Units held by such holder at a redemption price per Series B
Preferred Unit, payable in cash, equal to _[$27.50 plus amount of Additional
Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ plus an amount equal to any
accrued but unpaid distributions to but excluding the Preferred Redemption
Date (the " _Redemption Price_ ") to be paid by the Partnership. The Preferred
Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption (as
defined below) delivered to the General Partner by the holder of Series B
Preferred Units who is exercising the redemption right. Except in the event of
a Total Capital Shortfall Event or in the event of the death of a holder of
Series B Preferred Units (in which event the Preferred Redemption Right shall
be exercisable solely by such holders estate), the Preferred Redemption Right
shall only be available, and a Notice of Redemption in respect thereof may
only be delivered, once per quarter during the first month of each fiscal
quarter of the Partnership commencing January 2020. For purposes of this
_Exhibit G_, (a) " _Preferred Redemption Date_ " means the second to last
Business Day of the fiscal quarter of the Partnership in which the General
Partner receives the applicable Notice of Redemption pursuant to this _Section
2.D_ of this _Exhibit G_ or, if the second to last Business Day of such
fiscal quarter is less than ten (10) Business Days from the date on which the
General Partner receives the applicable Notice of Redemption pursuant to this
_Section 2.D_ of this _Exhibit G_, then the second to last Business Day of
the next subsequent fiscal quarter of the Partnership and (b) " _Publicly
Traded_ " means listed or admitted to trading on New York Stock Exchange LLC,
NYSE MKT LLC, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC or another national securities
exchange, or any successor to the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) In the event any applicable redemption date shall not be a Business Day,
then payment of the Redemption Price need not be made on such redemption date
but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on such applicable redemption date and no interest,
additional distributions or other sum shall accrue on the amount payable for
the period from and after such redemption date to such next succeeding
Business Day.

 



 

(iii) On and after the Preferred Redemption Date, all distributions on the
Series B Preferred Units designated for redemption in the Notice of Redemption
shall cease to accrue and all rights of the holder thereof, except the right
to receive the Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever, and such holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of
such Series B Preferred Units.

 



 

(iv) At its election, the Partnership, following its receipt of a Notice of
Redemption and prior to a Preferred Redemption Date, may irrevocably deposit
the Redemption Price of the Series B Preferred Units so called for redemption
in trust for the holder thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case
(a) the Partnership shall notify the applicable holder of such Series B
Preferred Units in writing that the Redemption Price has been so deposited,
(b) on and after the applicable Preferred Redemption Date, all distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units designated for redemption in the Notice of
Redemption shall cease to accrue and (c) on and after the date of such Notice
of Redemption and the date such funds have been set aside, all rights of the
holders of such Series B Preferred Units except the right to receive the
Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B Preferred Units
shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and such
holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of such Series B
Preferred Units.

 



 

(v) In the event the General Partner (or its direct or indirect parent) is (as
the result of any merger, acquisition or otherwise) a REIT with Publicly
Traded equity securities, the General Partner shall

 



      
 

 



 

have the right, without the consent of any Partner or other Person,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, to amend this _Section
2.D_ of this _Exhibit G_ and any provision of the Agreement as necessary to
provide the REIT the option, in lieu of paying the Redemption Price in cash,
to issue an amount of Publicly Traded stock in such public REIT with a fair
market value at the time of redemption, as determined by the General Partner
in good faith, equal to the Redemption Price to any redeeming holders of
Series B Preferred Units who consent to such substitution with respect to such
particular redemption; _provided_ that this right of substitution shall be
available only if the shares of stock to be issued to such holder of Series B
Preferred Units pursuant hereto are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for immediate resale by the redeeming holder of Series B
Preferred Units.

 



 

(vi) For purposes of this _Exhibit G_, " _Notice of Redemption_ " means a
notice substantially in the following form:

 



 

"The undersigned hereby irrevocably (i) elects to redeem all of the
undersigneds Series B Preferred Units in GPT Operating Partnership LP in
accordance with the terms of _Exhibit G_ of the Fourth Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership of GPT Operating Partnership LP, as amended,
and as it may be further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, and, the redemption right referred to in _Section 2.D_ of
_Exhibit G_ thereof, (ii) surrenders such Series B Preferred Units and all
right, title and interest therein, for redemption pursuant to such provisions,
and (iii) directs that the Redemption Price deliverable upon exercise of such
redemption right pursuant to _Section 2.D_ of _Exhibit G_ thereof be
delivered to the undersigned at the address specified below.

E. _Redemption at Partnership s Option_

 



 

(i) Commencing on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Partnership
shall have the right, in its sole discretion and from time to time (the "
_Partnership Redemption Right_ "), to redeem all or any portion of the Series
B Preferred Units then outstanding ( _provided_ , that the Partnership
Redemption Right shall not be exercised for less than all of the Series B
Preferred Units if, after the exercise of such Partnership Redemption Right,
Series B Preferred Units with less than $5 million in aggregate liquidation
preference would remain outstanding), for a cash redemption price per Series B
Preferred Unit equal to the Redemption Price. The Partnership shall exercise
the Partnership Redemption Right by providing each record holder of Series B
Preferred Units not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days
prior written notice of the applicable date of redemption. Such notice shall
include (a) the number of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed from each
such holder, (ii) the applicable Redemption Price, (c)

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable date of redemption and (d) that distributions on the Series B
Preferred Units to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on and after such
redemption date. No failure to give or defect in such notice or defect in the
mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Series B Preferred Units except as to any holder of Series B
Preferred Units to whom notice was defective or not given.

 



 

(ii) If the Partnership redeems less than all of the outstanding Series B
Preferred Units pursuant to any exercise of the Partnership Redemption Right
under this _Section 2.E_ of this _Exhibit G_, the Series B Preferred Units
to be redeemed may be determined by the General Partner pro rata from the
record holders of Series B Preferred Units (with any appropriate adjustments
in the General Partners sole discretion to avoid redemption of fractions of
Series B Preferred Units), or by any other equitable manner determined by the
General Partner in its reasonable discretion.

 



 

(iii) In the event any applicable redemption date shall not be a Business Day,
then payment of the Redemption Price need not be made on such redemption date
but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on such applicable redemption date and no interest,
additional distributions or other sum shall accrue on the amount payable for
the period from and after such redemption date to such next succeeding
Business Day.

 



 

(iv) On and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership defaults in
payment of the Redemption Price), all distributions on the Series B Preferred
Units designated for redemption in the notice of redemption shall cease to
accrue and all rights of the holder thereof, except the right to receive the
Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B Preferred Units
shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and such
holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of such Series B
Preferred Units.

 



 

(v) At its election, the Partnership, prior to the redemption date, may
irrevocably deposit the Redemption Price of the Series B Preferred Units so
called for redemption in trust for the holder(s) thereof with a bank or trust
company, in which case (a) the Partnership shall notify the applicable holder
of such Series B Preferred Units in writing that the Redemption Price has been
so deposited, (b) on and after the applicable redemption date, all
distributions on the Series B Preferred Units designated for redemption in the
notice of redemption shall cease to accrue and (c) on and after the date of
such notice of redemption and the date such funds have been set aside, all
rights of the holder thereof, except the right to receive the Redemption
Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B Preferred Units shall not be
deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and such holder shall
cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of such Series B Preferred Units.

 



 

F. _Ranking_

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement, including any amendments made
thereto or to this _Exhibit G_ after the Closing Date, but subject to
_Section 2.G_ of this _Exhibit G_, the Series B Preferred Units shall, with
respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, rank senior to all
other series or classes of Partnership Interests (all of which are referred to
collectively as " _Series B Junior Units_").

 



 

G. _Voting Rights_

 



 

(i) The holders of Series B Preferred Units shall have no voting rights
whatsoever on any matter relating to the Partnership, whether under the
Agreement, the Act, at law, in equity or otherwise, except as expressly set
forth in this _Exhibit G_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) So long as Series B Preferred Units with at least $5 million in aggregate
liquidation preference remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of
the holders of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred Units,
outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, at a meeting (voting as
a separate class) or in writing (without prior notice and without a vote) will
be required to amend, alter or repeal the provisions of this _Exhibit G_ or
the Applicable Provisions, whether by merger or consolidation or otherwise (an
" _Event_ "), so as to permit the Partnership to either (a) authorize, create
or issue any class or series of Partnership Interests ranking senior to or on
a parity with the Series B Preferred Units with respect to rights to the
payment of distributions and the distribution of assets upon voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership ("
_Senior/Parity Units_ "), (b) reclassify any authorized Partnership Interests
into Senior/Parity Units, (c) authorize, create or issue any obligation or
security convertible into or exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
purchase any Senior/Parity Units or (d) materially and adversely affect any
other special right, power or preference of the Series B Preferred Units or
the holders thereof with respect to this _Exhibit G_ or the Applicable
Provisions; _provided however_ , that so long as (I) the Series B Preferred
Units remain outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged (taking
into account that the Partnership may not be the surviving entity), or (II)
the holders of the Series B Preferred Units receive equity securities of the
surviving entity (taking into account that the surviving entity may not be a
limited partnership or formed in Delaware), with special rights, powers and
preferences substantially the same as those of the Series B Preferred Units,
the occurrence of such Event shall not be deemed for purposes of clause (d) of
this paragraph to materially and adversely affect such special rights, powers
and preferences of holders of Series B Preferred Units, and in such case such
holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the occurrence of
such Event so long as no such vote would be required under any of clauses (a),
(b) or (c) of this paragraph. Holders of Series B Preferred Units shall not be
entitled to vote with respect to (I) any amendment, supplement or modification
of any term or provision of the Agreement, other than as expressly provided in
the immediately preceding sentence, or (II) the creation, authorization or
issuance of any Series B Junior Units. Except as set forth herein, holders of
Series B Preferred Units, whether in their capacities as Partners or
otherwise, shall not have any voting rights whatsoever, including any voting
right that may otherwise arise under the Agreement, the Act, at law, in equity
or otherwise, and the consent of the holders shall not be required for any
action, including the taking of any partnership action, including an Event,
regardless of the effect that such partnership action or Event may have upon
the special rights, powers or preferences of the Series B Preferred Units. For
purposes of this _Exhibit G_, " _Applicable Provisions_ " means the following
provisions of the Agreement: _Section 4.01_ (Capital Contribution of the
Partners), _Section 8.01_ (Limitation of Liability), _Section 8.02_
(Management of Business), _Section 8.03_ (Outside Activities of Limited
Partners), _Section 9.01_ (Records and Accounting), _Section 9.03_
(Reports), _Article X_ (Tax Matters), _Section 11.01_ (Transfer), _Section
11.03_ (Limited Partners Right to Transfer), _Section 11.04_ (Substituted
Limited Partners), _Article XII_ (Admission of Partners) and _Section 15.11_
(Power of Attorney), and, in each case, the definitions relating thereto.

 



 

(iii) The foregoing voting provisions of this _Section 2._G of this _Exhibit
G_ shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding
Series B Preferred Units shall have been redeemed or called for redemption
upon proper notice pursuant to _Section 2.D_ or _Section 2.E_ of this
_Exhibit G_ and sufficient funds, in cash or securities, as applicable, shall
have been deposited in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust
company to effect such redemption in accordance with _Section 2.D.(iv)_ or
_Section 2.E.(v)_ of this _Exhibit G_.

 



 

(iv) In any matter in which the holders of Series B Preferred Units may vote
or act by written consent (as expressly provided herein), each Series B
Preferred Unit shall be entitled to one vote.

 



      
 

 



 

H. _Transfer Restrictions_

 



 

The Series B Preferred Units are subject to the restrictions on "transfer"
contained in _Article XI_.

 



 

I. _No Conversion Right_

 



 

The Series B Preferred Units shall not be convertible into any other class or
series of interest in the Partnership or capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

J. _No Sinking Fund_

 



 

No sinking fund shall be established for the retirement or redemption of
Series B Preferred Units.

 



 

K. _Allocations_

 



 

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law (a) each holder of Series B
Preferred Units shall be deemed to have a Capital Account as of the Closing
Date equal to the product of _[$27.50 plus amount of Additional Consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ multiplied by the number of Series B
Preferred Units held by such holder; (b) the Partnerships Net Income shall
first be allocated to the holders of the Series B Preferred Units during each
Partnership Year until the aggregate amount of Net Income allocated to each of
the holders of Series B Preferred Units is equal to the sum of all
distributions paid to such holder pursuant to _Section 2.B_ of this _Exhibit
G_ from the Closing Date to the date of such allocation plus any Net Losses
allocated to such holder pursuant to this _Section 2.K_ of this _Exhibit G_
from the Closing Date to the date of such allocation; (c) all remaining Net
Income of the Partnership shall be allocated to the holders of Partnership
Interests other than the Series B Preferred Units; (d) all Net Losses of the
Partnership shall be allocated to the holders of the Partnership Interests
other than the Series B Preferred Units until the Adjusted Capital Account
Balance (as defined below) of each such holder of such Partnership Interests
has been reduced to zero; (e) Net Losses of the Partnership next shall be
allocated to the holders of Series B Preferred Units until the Adjusted
Capital Account Balance of each such holder of such Series B Preferred Units
has been reduced to zero; and (f) any remaining Net Losses of the Partnership
shall be allocated to the General Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
holder of Series B Preferred Units receives a distribution pursuant to
_Section 2.B_ of this _Exhibit G_ and after such distribution and
allocations of Net Income pursuant to this _Section 2.K_ of this _Exhibit G_
for the then-current fiscal year, the Adjusted Capital Account Balance of such
holder in the then-current fiscal period would be less than the amounts such
holder would be entitled to receive upon a liquidation of the Partnership,
items of gross income and gain will be allocated to match the distribution to
the extent that the cumulative Net Income allocated pursuant to this _Section
2.K_ of this _Exhibit G_ for the then-current and prior fiscal periods and
gross income and gain allocated pursuant to this _Section 2.K_ of this
_Exhibit G_ for prior fiscal periods (both reduced by any Net Loss allocated
under this _Section 2.K_ of this _Exhibit G_ that has offset such
allocations) are less than cumulative distributions made under _Section 2.B_
of this _Exhibit G_ for the then-current and prior fiscal periods.
Allocations to Partners in accordance with _Article VI_ of the Agreement
shall take into account allocations required to be made pursuant to this
_Section 2.K_ of this _Exhibit G_. For purposes of this _Exhibit G_, "
_Adjusted Capital Account Balance_ " means a positive balance in a Partners
Capital Account, after giving effect to the adjustments described in clauses
(i) and (ii) in the definition of "Adjusted Capital Account."

 



      
 

 



 

L. _Miscellaneous_

 



 

(i) The holders of Series B Preferred Units shall not have any preferences or
other rights, powers (including voting powers), restrictions, rights as to
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption other than
as expressly set forth in the Applicable Provisions and this _Exhibit G_.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or this _Exhibit G_
or otherwise applicable provision of law or equity, whenever in this _Exhibit
G_ the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its (i)
"sole discretion," the General Partner shall be entitled to consider only such
interests and factors as it desires, and shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, have no duty or obligation to give any
consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the holders of Series B
Preferred Units or the holders thereof in their capacities as such, or (ii)
"good faith" or under another expressed standard, the General Partner shall
act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or
different standards.
