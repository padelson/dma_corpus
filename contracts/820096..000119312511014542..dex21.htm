(i) Not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare, or

in such a manner as to not materially interfere with normal operation of
Purchasers business, to the books, records and other documents (including
work papers) pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Date Schedule of Adjustments. If the Company does not deliver any
written objections to Purchaser within such 30-day period, the Company shall
be deemed to have accepted the Closing Date Schedule of Adjustments
and Purchasers calculations of the Closing Date Working Capital and Closing
Date Debt Amount, and the Company shall have irrevocably waived any right to
object thereto. If the Company does timely deliver such written objections,
Purchaser and the Company shall, for a period of 30 days thereafter, attempt
to resolve such objections in good faith.

 



14 (ii) If the Company and Purchaser do not resolve all such objections to the

upon which the Parties are unable to agree. The decision of the Independent
Accountant shall be final and binding and conclusive upon Purchaser and the
Company for all purposes under this Agreement (absent fraud or manifest error
by the Independent Accountant); _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the
determination of the Independent Accountant of the Working Capital shall not
be higher than the amount determined by the Company or lower than the amount
determined by Purchaser, and (2) the determination of the Independent
Accountant of the Debt Amount shall not be higher than the amount determined
by Purchaser or lower than the amount determined by the Company. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by Purchaser
and the Company.

(b) _Payment of Adjustment_. The Working Capital and the Debt Amount, each as
finally determined in accordance with Section 3.3(a), based on (i) Purchasers
computations (if not disputed by the Company), (ii) the agreement of the
Company and Purchaser or (iii) the determination of the Independent
Accountant, as the case may be, are referred to herein as the " _Final Working
Capital_ " and " _Final Debt Amount_ ", respectively. Not later than five
Business Days after the Final Working Capital and Final Debt Amount are
finally determined:

(i) (A) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, then Purchaser shall pay to the Company the amount of such excess or
(B) if the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital,
then, at Purchasers option, the Company shall promptly pay, or the
Company and Purchaser shall cause the Escrow Agent to promptly pay, to
Purchaser the amount of such deficiency; and

(ii) (A) if the Final Debt Amount is less than the Estimated Debt Amount,
then Purchaser shall pay to the Company the amount of such deficiency, or (B)

made, no later than five Business Days after the final determination of the
amounts required to be paid hereunder. Each Party shall be entitled to set off
all amounts owed by it under this Section 3.3(b) against all amounts owed to

by Purchaser to the Company or by the Company (out of the Escrow Amount) to
Purchaser, as the case may be.

the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Sellers
shall prepare and provide to Purchaser a draft allocation of the Purchase
Price among the Transferred Assets within 60 days after the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall notify the Sellers within 30 Business Days of receipt of such
draft allocation of any objection Purchaser may have thereto. If Purchaser
objects to the computations or allocation by the Sellers of such amounts, and
Purchaser and the Sellers do not reach agreement on the computation or

the Sellers and Purchaser shall submit the issue to arbitration by the

the Sellers and Purchaser hereby undertake and agree to file timely any
information that may be required to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 1060(b) of the Code, and shall use the allocation
determined pursuant to this Section 3.6(a) in connection with the preparation

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither of the Sellers nor
Purchaser shall file any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take any

(b) _Withholding_. Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable by it pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such

respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law, or with respect to any estimated Tax or
withholding required to be made by the Company or the Subsidiary with respect
to any Seller; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not withhold with respect to
the payment of any portion of the Purchase Price with respect to a Seller if
such Seller provides a duly executed affidavit of non-foreign status that
complies with Section 1445 of the Code and an IRS Form W-9 claiming a
complete exemption from backup withholding; _provided_ , _further_ that, prior
to making such withholding (other than withholding on account of the failure
by a Seller to provide an affidavit of non-foreign status that complies with
Section 1445 of the Code or an IRS Form W-9, in each case, as required above),
Purchaser shall notify the Sellers thereof and shall reasonably cooperate with
the Sellers in connection with any objection the Sellers may have in respect
of such determination by Purchaser. In the event that any amount is so
deducted and withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom the payment from
which such amounts were withheld was made.

part of any such Company Pension Plan has at all times since its adoption been
tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred or circumstance exists relating to any such
Company Pension Plan that would adversely affect the qualification of such

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.16(g)_ the execution, delivery of, and
performance by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) will not (i)
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current, former or retired

and the Consents set forth on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay any consideration or
incur any obligation in order to obtain such consents and approvals, unless
Purchaser shall have agreed in writing to reimburse the Company for such
consideration or obligation.

(b) To the extent that (i) any Transferred Asset requires the consent of a
third Person to assign or transfer such Transferred Asset to Purchaser and
such consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) any
Transferred Asset is not, by its terms or under applicable Law, assignable and
transferable to Purchaser (in either case, a " _Non-Assignable Asset_ "),
this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or transfer or attempted
assignment or transfer thereof, unless and until, in the case of assignments

hold or cause to be held each such Non-Assignable Asset, from and after the
Closing Date, in trust for the benefit of Purchaser and the covenants and
obligations thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in the name of the
Company, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for the
account of Purchaser. With respect to any Non-Assignable Asset as to which the
necessary consent for the assignment or transfer to Purchaser is obtained
following the Closing, the Company, as soon as reasonably practicable
following receipt of such consent, shall transfer such Non-Assignable Asset to
Purchaser by execution and delivery of an instrument of conveyance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. With respect to any Permit that cannot
be assigned or transferred to Purchaser at Closing or obtained by Purchaser
after Closing, the Company agrees to file such applications, notices,
certifications, reports or other information as shall be necessary to convey
the benefits of each such Permit to Purchaser from and after the Closing, or
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date if such conveyance
cannot by Law by accomplished as of Closing.

contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable (but in any event prior to any
applicable legal deadline), (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with
any request received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates
from the FTC or any other Governmental Body under the Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other materials in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in
connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, providing copies, or portions thereof, of all such documents
to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of the FTC or
other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each Party shall use commercially best efforts
to furnish to each other Party all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall promptly
inform the other Parties of any oral communication with, and provide copies
of written communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. No Party shall independently participate in
any formal meeting or communication with any Governmental Body in respect of
any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
Parties prior notice of the meeting or such communication and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting or communication. Subject to applicable Law, the
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to
proceedings under the Antitrust Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not communicate with the FTC or any other Governmental Body with respect
to any structural or conduct relief. The Company and Purchaser may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.4(a) as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the recipients outside legal counsel and outside experts
retained for purposes of any investigation or inquiry and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel or outside expert to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Purchaser, as the
case may be).

 



38 (b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take all such actions as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the Antitrust
Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement, including

39 Section 6.8 _Agreement Not to Compete or Solicit_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause each of its
Affiliates (which, solely for purposes of this Section 6.8, shall exclude
Bruce Paddock) not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or
otherwise engage in any business (a " _Competing Business_ ") that competes
with (i) the Products during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted
Period_ "), and (ii) the Business during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and expiring on the second anniversary of the Closing Date;  _provided_
, _however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this Section 6.8(a) for the
Company or any of its Affiliates to (w) beneficially and passively own any
stock (or other equity interest convertible into stock) of any corporation
listed on a national securities exchange that invests in, manages or operates
a Competing Business, in each case, provided that such stock (or stock
obtained upon conversion of such other equity interests) represents less than
five percent of the outstanding capital stock of such Person, (x) acquire
(and thereafter continue to own) all or a majority of the stock or assets of
any Person that derived less than five percent of its annual consolidated
revenues from a Competing Business during the calendar year immediately
preceding the consummation of such acquisition, (y) develop, manufacture or
sell active pharmaceutical ingredients primarily intended for incorporation
into finished dose non-human pharmaceutical products, or (z) consummate any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and comply with the terms
of this Agreement.

(b) During the Restricted Period, the Company agrees that it shall not, and it
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
influence, entice or encourage any Continuing Employee who at such time is an
employee of Purchaser, or any current customer of the Company or the
Subsidiary who at such time is a customer of Purchaser, to cease or curtail
his or her relationship therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions of this Section 6.8(b) shall not apply to the placement of
general advertisements or the use of general search firm services that are not
targeted directly or indirectly toward employees or customers of Purchaser.

 

(c) In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 6.8 should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such
adjudicating court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum
time, geographic, product, service and/or other limitations, as applicable,
permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 6.8 and
each provision thereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



40 Section 6.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall, except to
the extent required by any Governmental Body or applicable Law, keep
confidential, and shall use its best efforts to cause its respective
directors, officers, representatives and Affiliates to keep confidential, all
information concerning the other Parties disclosed prior to the date of this
Agreement or hereafter in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and none of such information shall be used in any manner other
than in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby. If this Agreement is terminated, each of the Sellers and Purchaser
shall promptly return to the other Parties, as applicable (or, if requested by
such other Parties, destroy and certify such destruction to such other Parties
in writing), all documents and materials (and productions thereof) furnished
to it or its Affiliates or representatives in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary thereof, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
directors, officers, representatives and Affiliates to, treat and hold as
confidential all information relating to the Business. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective partners,
trustees, representatives and Affiliates not to, use or disclose any
such confidential information to any Person (except as may be necessary to
disclose such information to such Persons professional advisors); it being
acknowledged that the foregoing restriction shall not be construed as
extending the obligations of the Company or its Affiliates under Section 6.8
or the Non-Compete Agreement beyond the Restricted Period. In the event that
any Seller or any of its partners, trustees, representatives or Affiliates is
required (by a Governmental Body or by applicable Law) to disclose any such
confidential information, then such Person shall promptly notify Purchaser of
the requirement so that Purchaser may, at its expense, seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with this Section 6.9(b). If, in the
absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller or
any of its partners, trustees, representatives or Affiliates is, on the advice
of counsel, compelled to disclose such confidential information, such Person
may so disclose the confidential information; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to such confidential
information.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.9 will not be deemed to prohibit the
disclosure of confidential information to the extent reasonably and directly
required (i) to prepare or complete any required Tax Returns or financial
statements, (ii) by a Governmental Body or (iii) to comply with any applicable
Law. The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall not apply to information that
is or becomes (A) publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by
the Party that received such information or (B) available to a Party or any of
such Partys respective directors, officers, partners, trustees,
representatives or Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source that,
to the knowledge of such receiving Person, is not prohibited from disclosing
such information by any legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.

 



41 Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall offer to each Business Employee employment with Purchaser,
to be effective as of the Closing (the " _Employment Offer_ "), which offers
may be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing (for the avoidance of
doubt, Employment Offers may be made orally). Each Employment Offer shall (x)
be for a position substantially similar to the Business Employees current
position and at the Business Employees current location and (y) include an
offer to provide base pay that is equal to or higher than such Business
Employees base salary as of the Closing Date and employee benefits as
described in Section 6.10(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the
following provisions of this Section 6.10, the foregoing shall not be
construed to prevent Purchaser from changing the position, location, base pay
or other terms and conditions of employment of any Continuing Employee
following the Closing Date. The Business Employees who accept Employment
Offers and actually (i) commence employment with Purchaser on the Closing
Date, or (ii) on the Closing Date are on a leave previously approved by the
Company or authorized by applicable Law (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") shall become employees of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
effective as of immediately following the Closing and their employment with
the Company shall cease as of immediately following the Closing. Any Business
Employee who terminates employment with the Company as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is subsequently hired by
Purchaser within 180 days after the Closing Date shall be treated as a
Continuing Employee. The Company agrees to cooperate in good faith with
Purchaser to achieve the acceptance of all of the Employment Offers.

 

(b) At the Closing, without limiting Section 2.1, Purchaser shall assume the
Change of Control Agreements and the Employment Agreements and, in each case,
shall be solely responsible for any and all obligations thereunder following
the Closing, except for the Change of Control Discretionary Bonuses (which are
Excluded Liabilities for which the Company will claim deductions for income
tax purposes) and except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6.10(b). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Employment Agreements shall not include the SAR
Agreements or the amounts payable thereunder (which are
Excluded Liabilities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
Purchaser, during the eighteen-month period following the Closing Date, pays
any Change of Control Retention Bonuses or severance due under the Change of
Control Agreements or Employment Agreements (including accrued benefits and
compensation obligations, salary and bonus payments, health benefits, life
insurance, employee tax gross-ups and employment-related Taxes) (the "
_Retention and Severance Amounts_ "), then Purchaser shall deliver to the
Company written evidence of each such payment and, at the option of Purchaser,
(x) the Company shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to 50% of the Retention
and Severance Amounts within ten Business Days following such delivery, (y)
Purchaser may deduct an amount equal to 50% of the Retention and Severance
Amounts from amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3(b) or (z)
Purchaser may instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to promptly pay to Purchaser an amount equal to 50% of such
Retention and Severance Amounts; _provided_ , that the Companys obligation to
reimburse Purchaser for 50% of the Retention and Severance Amounts
pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) shall be capped at $2,500,000 in the
aggregate. Purchaser shall notify the Company upon the satisfaction of the
conditions necessary for an applicable Business Employee to earn a Change of
Control Discretionary Bonus or the Retention and Severance Amounts, as set
forth in such Business Employees Change of Control Agreement or Employment
Agreement.

 



42 (c) Each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to continue to participate, at
the option of Purchaser, in Company Benefit Plans (to the extent assumed by
Purchaser) or in the employee benefit plans maintained by Purchaser (each, a "
_Purchaser Benefit Plan_ ") on substantially the same basis as similarly
situated employees of Purchaser; _provided_ , that the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate in Purchasers 401(k) plan as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, each
Continuing Employee shall receive credit for all service with the Company
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and benefit accrual where length of service is relevant (excluding accruals
under defined benefit plans); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, take
all reasonable steps to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods
and actively-at-work or similar requirements with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefit plans that
such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date; and
(ii) provide Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with credit
for any co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket requirements and offsets (or
similar payments) made under the Company Benefit Plans for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs under Purchaser Benefit Plans for the purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements
thereunder as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Purchaser
Benefit Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date shall be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Closing Date in accordance with the policies
set forth in _Schedule 6.10_. The Continuing Employees are not third-party
beneficiaries of the provisions of this Section 6.10, and nothing herein
expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any Continuing Employee
any legal or equitable rights hereunder, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or level of compensation or
benefits. Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall (A) limit the right of Purchaser or its
Affiliates to terminate the employment or services of, or to reassign or
otherwise alter the status of, any Continuing Employee or contractor or
consultant of the Company and the Subsidiary after the Closing, or to change
in any manner the terms and conditions of his or her employment or other
service to or engagement by the Company and the Subsidiary, (B) be construed
to prevent, and no action by the Company or the Subsidiary prior to the
Closing Date shall limit the ability of, Purchaser or its Affiliates from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit
plan that Purchaser or its Affiliates may establish or maintain, or (C) be
construed as amending any Company Benefit Plan as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay to each applicable Business
Employee a bonus award determined in accordance with the applicable bonus
plan, which will not be inconsistent with the past practices of the Company
and which will be prorated to reflect the portion of the year actually worked
for the Company.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall contribute to the Companys 401(k)
Plan an amount equal to the Companys employer matching and profit sharing
contributions for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs through the
Closing Date (which contributions shall be determined on a basis consistent
with the Companys past practices).

 

(f) The Company and Purchaser agree that, pursuant to the "Alternative
Procedures" provided in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, with respect
to the filing and furnishing of Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2, W-3 and
941 for the full calendar year in which the Closing occurs, (i) the Company
and Purchaser shall report on a "predecessor-successor" basis, as set forth
therein, (ii) the Company shall be relieved from furnishing Forms W-2 to any
Continuing Employees, and (iii) Purchaser shall assume the obligations of the
Company to furnish Forms W-2 to such Continuing Employees and Forms W-2 and
W-3 with respect to Continuing Employees to the Social Security
Administration; _provided_ that the Company shall transfer to Purchaser all
Forms W-4 and W-5 with respect to the Continuing Employees, and such other
data relating to Continuing Employees as shall be necessary for Purchaser to
assume and satisfy such obligations accurately and in accordance with the law.

 



43 (g) After the Closing, the selling group (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3(a)) of which the Company is a part will
cease to offer a group health plan to employees and, accordingly, Purchaser
agrees that it shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation
coverage requirements pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(h) On or before the 30th day after the Closing, the Company shall pay to each
respective recipient all amounts owed under (i) the Companys Phantom Stock

any cost of determining that there has been a breach under this Agreement
(provided that a breach is determined to have occurred)) or Tax
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party

Proceeding based on or arising out of the same or similar facts or
circumstances as those involved in the Legal Proceedings set forth as items

49 For purposes of determining the amount of Losses incurred with respect to a

any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, each such representation
or warranty shall be read without reference to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifier.

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to Section 8.4, from and

the amount of Losses incurred with respect to a breach of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered

qualifier.

 

Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Neither the Company nor Purchaser shall have any liability under Section
8.2(a) or 8.3(a), as applicable, unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, exceeds 1.0% of the Cash
Purchase Price (the " _Basket_ "), after which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled
to indemnification for all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, and not just the
excess over the Basket; _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in
this Section 8.4(a) shall not apply to breaches of the representations and
warranties listed in Section 8.1(a) (other than those representations or
warranties set forth in Section 4.16).

 

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Company or Purchaser under Section 8.2(a) or 8.3(a), as applicable, exceed
$54,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in
this Section 8.4(b) shall not apply to breaches of the representations and
warranties listed in Section 8.1(a) (other than those representations or
warranties set forth in Section 4.16); _provided_ , _however_ , that all
amounts paid by the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, in respect of
indemnification for the representations and warranties listed in Section
8.1(a) shall be taken into account when determining whether the Cap has been
reached for all of such Partys other indemnification obligations under
Sections 8.2(a) and 8.3(a).

 

(c) The Parties shall treat any and all payments under this Article VIII as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes, unless they are
required to treat such payments otherwise pursuant to a closing agreement with
the applicable taxing authority or the decision of a court with jurisdiction
over such matters.

 



50 (d) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the
proceeds of any insurance that would have the effect of reducing any Losses,
and the amount of any Losses incurred by any indemnified party shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by such
indemnified party. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior
to the collection of such insurance proceeds, such indemnified party shall
remit to the indemnifying party the amount of such insurance proceeds to the
extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such Losses (in
each case, net of all costs of collection thereof, including attorneys fees).
To the extent any Loss of an indemnified party is reduced by receipt of
payment (i) under insurance policies which are not subject to retroactive
adjustment or other reimbursement to the insurer in respect of such payment,
or (ii) from third parties not affiliated with the indemnified party, such
payments (net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) shall be credited
against any such Losses.

(e) The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the indemnified partys
rights of recovery to the extent of any Losses paid by the indemnifying
party. The indemnified party shall execute and deliver such instruments and
papers as are necessary to assign such rights and assist in the exercise
thereof.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 11.3 in respect of Section 6.5, 6.6, 6.8 or
6.9, if the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this Article VIII
(and as limited by this Article VIII) shall be the sole remedies of the
indemnified parties in respect of any claims, howsoever denominated, arising
out of this Agreement or relating in any way to the subject matter hereof,
and shall preclude assertion by the indemnified parties of any other rights or
the seeking of any other remedies against the indemnifying parties with
respect to the matters covered by the indemnification provisions contained in
this Article VIII or otherwise relating in any manner to the subject matter
hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing and, if the Closing occurs, each Party
shall waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and agrees
not to assert in any action or proceeding of any kind, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it may then or thereafter have against any other
Party (including any such rights, claims or causes of action arising under or
based upon common law or equity) other than claims for indemnification
asserted as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions set forth in
this Article VIII.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Losses to
the extent such item or matter was taken into account in the calculation of
Final Working Capital or Final Debt Amount.

(h) EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, NO PARTY WILL IN ANY EVENT BE
LIABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE VIII FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR EARNINGS,
DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
BY REASON OF A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR INDEMNITY
CONTAINED HEREIN.

 



51 (i) The Seller Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as the
case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses
sustained by such Person(s).

(j) In no event shall any indemnified party be entitled to double recovery
hereunder. If any circumstance constitutes a breach of more than one
representation, warranty or covenant of an indemnifying party, the indemnified
party(ies) shall only be entitled to recover once in respect of such
circumstance.

(k) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall first utilize the Escrow Amount to
satisfy any claims for indemnification hereunder before attempting to obtain
indemnification directly from the Sellers.

Section 8.5  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Third Party Claims._ Subject to Section 10.2, in the event that any
Legal Proceeding is instituted or asserted by a third party in respect of
which indemnification will be sought under Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof, the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice (the " _Third Party
Notice_ ") of the assertion of such Legal Proceeding to be forwarded to the
indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole
option and expense, by providing written notice acknowledging its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 to (i) take
control of the defense and investigation of such Legal Proceeding, (ii) employ
and engage attorneys of its own choice (subject to the approval of the
indemnified party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
to handle and defend the same, at the indemnifying partys sole cost, risk and
expense, and (iii) compromise or settle such Legal Proceeding, which
compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the
indemnified party; _provided_ , that such consent will not be required if such
settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party and
otherwise provides solely for payment of monetary damages for which the
indemnifying party will be responsible (except with respect to an item
relating to Taxes, which is covered in Section 10.2). The indemnified party
shall, at the expense of the indemnifying party, cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the indemnifying parties and their attorneys in the
investigation, trial and defense of such Legal Proceeding and any appeal
arising therefrom, and the indemnified party may, at its own cost, monitor and
further participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Legal
Proceeding and any appeal arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the indemnifying
parties election to assume the defense of such Legal Proceeding, the
indemnified party shall have, upon giving prior written notice to the
indemnifying parties, the right to employ one separate counsel and to
participate in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, and the indemnifying
parties shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate
counsel for the indemnified party if, but only if, the indemnified party
shall have reasonably concluded in good faith that (x) an actual or potential
conflict of interest (including one or more legal defenses or counterclaims
available to it or to other indemnified parties that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying parties) makes it
inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party (upon and in
conformity with the advice of counsel) for the same counsel to represent both
the indemnified party and the indemnifying parties or (y) the claim seeks
nonmonetary relief which, if granted, could materially and adversely affect
the indemnified party or its Affiliates. If the indemnifying party elects not
to defend against such Legal Proceeding, does not, within 60 days after
receipt of the Third Party Notice (or such earlier date, if the failure to
assume the defense by such earlier date would materially impair the ability of
the indemnified party to defend such Legal Proceeding), acknowledge in
writing its intent to assume the defense of such Legal Proceeding pursuant to
this Section 8.5(a), or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, the indemnified party may
defend against such Legal Proceeding and the indemnifying parties shall have
the right to participate therein at their own cost. If the indemnified party
defends any Legal Proceeding, then it shall keep the indemnifying party
regularly apprised of the status of the Legal Proceeding and the indemnifying
party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable expenses of one
counsel engaged by the indemnified party to defend such Legal Proceeding upon
submission of periodic bills and, if the indemnified party is Purchaser,
Purchaser shall be entitled in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to
instruct the Escrow Agent to release from escrow to Purchaser an amount equal
to such reasonable expenses. In no event shall the indemnified party be
entitled to compromise or settle any Legal Proceeding without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



52 (b) _Non-Third Party Claims_. Subject to Section 10.2, if a claim for Losses
(a " _Claim_ ") is to be made by any indemnified party not in connection with
a Legal Proceeding instituted by a third party, such indemnified party shall
give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying
party reasonably promptly after such indemnified party becomes aware of any
fact, condition or event giving rise to Losses for which indemnification may
be sought under this Article VIII. If the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party that it does not dispute the claim described in such Claim
Notice, the Losses identified in the Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed
a liability of the indemnified party, and, if the indemnified party is
Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to instruct the Escrow Agent to release the amount of such Losses to
Purchaser.

(c) After any final deductible judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction,
and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall
have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Legal
Proceeding hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying
party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and, unless the indemnifying party
disputes any such amounts, the indemnifying party shall promptly pay such
amounts; _provided_ , that if the indemnified party is Purchaser, Purchaser
shall be entitled in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to instruct the
Escrow Agent to release from escrow such amounts to Purchaser.

(d) The failure of the indemnified party to deliver the Claim Notice or Third
Party Notice shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying
partys obligations with respect thereto, except if the indemnifying party
can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.

 



53 ARTICLE IX

_TERMINATION_

Section 9.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing as follows:

(a) by the Company or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have been
consummated within 180 days after the date hereof (which date shall be
extended for an additional 90 days, plus the number of days set forth in
Section 3.5(a), in the event that (i) any applicable review period in
connection with any Antitrust Law has not ended or any approval required
thereunder has not been received by the end of such 180-day period or (ii)
Purchaser is in the process of obtaining the Permits set forth on _Schedule
7.1(d)_ (as the same may be amended pursuant to Section 6.13), in each case,
so long as no Party is in default under this Agreement and all other
conditions precedent to the Closing have been or are reasonably expected to be
satisfied prior to the expiration of such additional 90-day period or, by
their terms, are to be satisfied at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a) if
the Closing shall not have been consummated by such date by reason of the
failure of such Party to perform, or to cause its Affiliates to perform, in
all material respects any of its or their respective covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement;

 

(b) by the Company or Purchaser in the event of a breach by the Sellers or
Purchaser, as applicable, of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement under this Agreement, where the effect of such breach would be to
cause the conditions to the obligation to consummate the Closing of the
terminating Party to be incapable of being satisfied, and such breach is not
cured by the breaching Party within 30 days after receiving written notice
from the terminating Party of the breach or alleged breach (it being
understood that such 30 day cure period shall not under any circumstances
extend the date set forth in Section 9.1(a)); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the terminating Party shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement if it
is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement;

(c) by mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser at any time prior
to the Closing Date; or

 

(d) by the Company or Purchaser if there shall be enacted a Law or imposed any
Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that the Parties shall
promptly appeal any adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and
pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence).

 

Section 9.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Purchaser or the Company, or both, pursuant to Section 9.1,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party, and this
Agreement shall terminate, and the purchase of the Transferred Assets
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser or
the Sellers. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, each Party
shall promptly return to the other Parties, as applicable (or, if requested by
such other Parties, destroy and certify such destruction to such other Parties
in writing), all documents and materials (and production thereof) furnished
to it or its Affiliates or representatives in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



54 Section 9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided herein, then each of the Parties shall be
relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability to
Purchaser or either Seller;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of
the Parties set forth in Section 6.6 and Section 6.9, this Section 9.3 and
Article XI shall survive any such termination and shall continue to be
enforceable hereunder; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this
Section 9.3 shall relieve Purchaser or either Seller of any liability for a
breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

_TAX_

 

Section 10.1 _Tax Returns_. The Sellers shall have the exclusive obligation
and authority to prepare, file or cause to be filed all federal, state,
local, and foreign Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Sellers
pursuant to applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
prepare, promptly after the Closing Date, all sales and use, property
tax, employment tax and similar Tax Returns of the Sellers and the Subsidiary
that relate exclusively to the Business and the Transferred Assets that are
due to be filed after the Closing Date, but not including any income,
franchise or similar Tax Return. With respect to each Tax Return of the
Sellers or the Subsidiary required to be prepared by Purchaser pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall deliver, such Tax Returns to the Sellers a
reasonable period of time prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return (taking into account available extensions), but Purchaser will not be
responsible for filing any such Tax Return or paying any Tax due with respect
to such Tax Return.

 

Section 10.2 _Tax Controversies_. The Sellers shall have the exclusive
authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority and
contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any
liability of the Company for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period.

 

Section 10.3 _Notification_. Purchaser shall promptly forward to the Sellers
all written notifications and other communications from any taxing authority
received by Purchaser relating to any Tax audit or other proceeding relating
to any Tax liability for which the Sellers may be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2. The failure of Purchaser to give the
Sellers such written notice shall excuse the Sellers from their obligations
under Section 8.2 with respect to any increased Tax liability directly or
indirectly attributable to any such written notification or other
communication if the failure to provide such written notice materially
adversely affected the ability of the Sellers to contest any claim arising
from such Tax audit or other proceeding.

 



55 Section 10.4 _Apportionment of Taxes_. All real property Taxes, personal
property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the
Transferred Assets for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date shall be apportioned between the Sellers and Purchaser as of
the Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable period included
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the number of days of such taxable period
included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. The Sellers shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such
Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Period. If bills for such Taxes
have not been issued as of the Closing Date, and, if the amount of such Taxes
for the period including the Closing Date is not then known, the apportionment
of such Taxes shall be made at Closing on the basis of the prior periods
Taxes. After Closing, upon receipt of bills for the period including the
Closing Date, adjustments to the apportionment shall be made by the parties,
so that if either party paid more than its proper share at the Closing, the
other Party shall promptly reimburse such Party for the excess amount paid by
them. 

Section 10.5 _Tax Benefit_. If the Company makes any payment on account of a
Tax under Section 8.2 for any Pre-Closing Period and the payment of such Tax
gives rise to a current federal, state, local or foreign Tax Benefit to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for a Post-Closing Period, then promptly
following the filing of the Tax Return (or Tax Returns) reflecting such Tax
Benefit, Purchaser shall pay to the Company the amount of such Tax Benefit.
The determination of any such Tax Benefit shall be made in good faith by
Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean the
sum of the amount by which the Tax of Purchaser or its Affiliates to the
appropriate taxing authority is permanently reduced (including, without
limitation, by or as a result of a deduction, increase in basis, entitlement
to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any interest (on an after-Tax basis) from
such government or jurisdiction relating to such Tax liability.

Section 10.6 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_. Purchaser and the Sellers
shall provide each other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser or the Sellers in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return, any audit, or any judicial or administrative proceeding or
determination relating to liability for Taxes. Purchaser and the Seller shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and all material records or
other documents relating to Tax matters of the Business or the Transferred
Assets for the first taxable year or other taxable period ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior taxable years or other taxable periods until
the later of (a) seven years after the later of filing or the due date of the
return or (b) the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation, and
provide the other Party, upon the reasonable request of such other Party and
at the cost of the requesting Party with any record or information (including
making employees available to such other Party for reasonable periods of time)
which may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, proceeding or determination.

provided in this Agreement, all sales, use, transfer, intangible, recordation,

Agreement shall be borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand.

 



56 Section 11.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall bear

of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 11.3 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in respect of a breach of Section 2.1, Section 3.4, Section 6.5, Section
6.6, Section 6.8 or Section 6.9. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief with respect to breaches, threatened breaches or the non-performance by
the other Parties of the terms and provisions of such Sections, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 11.4  _Further Assurances_. Each Seller and Purchaser agrees to
execute and deliver such other documents or agreements and to take such other

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any federal or state court located within the State of New York over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and such Party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any Legal Proceeding related thereto
may be heard and determined in such courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which
he, she or it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any

the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any
provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. The waiver
by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any Party
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The
remedies provided in this Agreement are the only remedies available to the
Parties in connection with this Agreement.

 



57 (b) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that no representation, warranty,

Without limiting the generality of the disclaimer set forth in the preceding
sentence, (i) no Party nor any of its Affiliates has made or shall be deemed
to have made any representation or warranty in any presentation or written
information relating to its business given or to be given in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in any filing made or to
be made by or on behalf of such Party or any of its Affiliates with any
Governmental Body, and no statement made in any such presentation or written
materials, made in any such filing or contained in any such other information
shall be deemed a representation or warranty hereunder or otherwise, and (ii)
each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective
Affiliates, expressly disclaims any implied warranties, including
warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and warranties of
merchantability. Each Party acknowledges that each other Party, as applicable,

Section 11.15 _Guarantee_.

(a) The Guarantors hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantee, jointly and severally, as principal obligors, and not merely as
sureties, to Purchaser and its successors and permitted assigns, all
Liabilities of the Sellers to Purchaser arising out of or related to this
Agreement, including the indemnification obligations of the Company pursuant
to Article VIII. Each Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses that
the applicable Seller may have or have had to payment or performance of any
obligations guaranteed hereunder. The foregoing obligation of the Guarantors
constitutes a continuing guaranty of payment and performance, and not of
collection, and is and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances, including circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. The obligation of the
Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected
by the failure of Purchaser to assert any claim or demand against a Seller or
to enforce any remedy hereunder, but shall be reduced by any amount paid by a
Seller relating to an obligation guaranteed by the Guarantors hereunder.

(b) The Guarantors have the requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform their obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Guarantors of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Guarantors of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite entity action on the part of the Guarantors, and
no other entity proceedings or approvals on the part of the Guarantors are
necessary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantors and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by each other
Party, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors,
enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms.

FORM OF NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

THIS NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into on _
_, 2011 by and between PERRIGO COMPANY, a Michigan corporation (together with
its affiliates, "Perrigo"), and Bruce Paddock ("Paddock"). Each of Perrigo
and Paddock may be referred to herein individually as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties".

 

WHEREAS, Perrigo has entered into that certain Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement") with Paddock Laboratories, Inc. and Paddock Properties
Limited Partnership ( the "Sellers"), pursuant to which the Sellers have
agreed to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Perrigo, and Perrigo has
agreed to purchase, assume and accept, all the right, title and interest in,
to and under the Transferred Assets, and Perrigo has agreed to assume all of
the Transferred Liabilities (the "Acquisition") (terms used and not defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement); and

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Perrigo to consummate the Acquisition,
Paddock has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Perrigo acquiring the Transferred Assets
and the receipt of consideration in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the
Parties agree as follows:

 

1\. _Non-Competition._

(a) Paddock shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or
otherwise engage in a Competing Business that competes with (i) the Products
during the Restricted Period, and (ii) the Business during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit Paddock from: (i)
beneficially and passively owning any stock (or other equity interest
convertible into stock) of any corporation listed on a national securities
exchange that invests in, manages or operates a Competing Business, in each
case, provided that such stock (or stock obtained upon conversion of such
other equity interests) represents less than five percent of the
outstanding capital stock of such Person; (ii) acquiring (and thereafter
continuing to own) all or a majority of the stock or assets of any Person that
derived less than five percent of its annual consolidated revenues from a
Competing Business during the calendar year immediately preceding the
consummation of such acquisition; (iii) developing, manufacturing or selling
active pharmaceutical ingredients primarily intended for incorporation into
finished dose non-human pharmaceutical products; or (iv) owning any stock (or
other equity interest convertible into stock) of, being a member of the board
of directors of, or otherwise engaging in the business currently performed by,
Amerilab Technologies, Inc., whose current business the Parties acknowledge
is limited to the development or contract manufacturing of (v) ranitidine, (w)
generic versions of Airborne®, (x) branded over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products, (y) nutritional products and (z) effervescent products. 2\. _Non-Solicitation_. During the Restricted Period, Paddock shall not
directly or indirectly, solicit, influence, entice or encourage, any
Continuing Employee who at such time is an employee of Perrigo, or any current
customer of the Business who at such time is a customer of Perrigo, to cease
or curtail his, her, or its relationship with Perrigo; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing provision shall not preclude Paddock and his affiliates
from the placement of general advertisements or the use of general search firm
services that are not targeted directly or indirectly toward employees or
customers of Perrigo.

3\. _Remedies._

 

(a) The Parties recognize that irreparable harm would result from any breach
by Paddock of any restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement and that
monetary damages alone would not provide adequate relief for any such breach.
Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to Perrigo,
if Paddock breaches a restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement, the
parties acknowledge that injunctive relief in favor of Perrigo is proper
(without the requirement of posting a bond or other security).

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements herein are reasonable in all
respects and necessary for the protection of Perrigo, and Paddock acknowledges
that Perrigos willingness to enter into the Purchase Agreement is expressly
conditioned on Paddocks undertaking and complying with the agreements in this
Agreement. Accordingly, Paddock shall be bound by the restrictive covenants in
this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by Law, it being the intent
and spirit of the Parties that the foregoing shall be fully enforceable. In
the event that any covenant contained in Sections 1 and 2 should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such
adjudicating court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time,
geographic, product, service and/or other limitations, as applicable,
permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in Sections 1 and 2 and
each provision thereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant
or provision in any other jurisdiction.

4\. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE
CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. (b) EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING,
STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. IF THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS
PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT, AS A NON-COMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT, ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 

(C) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK OVER ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATED THERETO
MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
HE, SHE OR IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH
DISPUTE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE. EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT A JUDGMENT IN ANY
SUCH DISPUTE MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR
IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. 

(D) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENTS TO PROCESS BEING SERVED BY ANY PARTY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF A COPY THEREOF IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5.

_5\. Notices._ All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon (a) personal delivery, (b)
transmitters confirmation of receipt of a facsimile transmission, (c)
confirmed delivery by a standard overnight carrier of national reputation or

does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies.

 

7\. _Assignment; Binding Effect._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by either the Perrigo or Paddock (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void; provided, that Perrigo may assign any of its rights (but not its
obligations) to any direct or indirect subsidiary of Perrigo.

 

8\. _Entire Agreement, Amendment and Waivers._ This Agreement represents the
entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any
provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. The waiver
by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any Party
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The
remedies provided in this Agreement are the only remedies available to the
Parties in connection with this Agreement. 9\. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or portion thereof is
held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision or portion thereof shall
be deemed amended as necessary to make it valid and enforceable while
retaining as best as possible its original meaning and intent, and the balance
of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

10\. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures._ This Agreement may be executed and
delivered in two or more counterparts (including by electronic transmission),
each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all
of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

 

11\. _Headings._ The section headings of this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are to be given no effect in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.
