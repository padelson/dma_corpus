right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section
2.04_ (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that (A)
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any
bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by _Section 3.06_) and (B) shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify, subject
to the Companys reasonable approval (to be sought prior to the Effective
Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in accordance
with this _Article III_.

 



17 (b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.04_
and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon
surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.02_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the sole right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later
time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable and in any event within three (3) Business Days after
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ , and the Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes
have been paid. 

Section 3.03 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of the Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_ ,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Appraisal Shares.

Section 3.04  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto)
that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not
theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company
Stockholder is entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto.

 



18 Section 3.05 _No Liability_. None of AIG, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares
eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Section 3.06 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct, or the execution
and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent
or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_.

Section 3.07 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, AIG, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Appraisal Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs,
Company Restricted Stock Rights or cash-settled awards described in _Section
2.07(d)_, such amounts as AIG, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
AIG, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying
Agent are paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable Law or Order, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by AIG, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing any Intellectual Property
Rights owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in a manner that

Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the

valid and binding on the Company and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto and is in full
force and effect, except for such failures to be valid and binding or to be in
full force and effect which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
default under any lease or sublease set forth in Section 4.21 of the Company
Disclosure Letter by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, by any other party to any such lease or sublease,
and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice

each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

AIG Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.02 _Access to Information and Employees; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, afford the
Representatives of AIG, Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable notice to the

 



42  officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books
and records of the Company, and during such period the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish, as promptly as practicable, to
Parent (i) a copy of each report filed with or furnished to the SEC or an
Insurance Regulatory Authority after the date hereof and any material
correspondence or other materials received from any such agency with respect
to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their businesses or personnel, and (ii)
all other information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to
the extent that doing so (A) would be reasonably likely to cause a waiver of
attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, (B)
would constitute a violation of any applicable Law or Order, or (C) would
violate any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or bound. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall
provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and
shall use reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not risk waiver of such privilege
or violate the applicable Law, Order or Contract.

 

(b) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to
designate up to a total of six (6) directors, officers or employees of AIG,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, any
such director, officer or employee having expertise in finance, human
resources, actuarial accounting and risk management) to be present in the
offices of the Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours for
the purpose of facilitating the planning for the integration and post-Closing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and to facilitate
the Parents access to information as provided in _Section 6.02(a)_, and for
this purpose the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide such designated
directors, officers and employees with available office space and available
administrative support as may be reasonably requested by Parent for such
directors, officers and employees to carry out their functions as contemplated
by this _Section 6.02(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event Parent
desires to designate more than six (6) directors, officers or employees of
AIG, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section
6.02(b)_, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to mutually
agree upon a reasonable number for any such additional directors, officers or
employees of AIG, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may limit the presence and access
of such directors, officers and employees to the extent it believes in good
faith that such limitation is necessary in order to (i) protect attorney-
client privilege or the loss of attorney work product protection, (ii) comply
with any applicable Law or Order, or (iii) comply with any Contract entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or bound; provided, however, that such limitation will
be constructed to the extent possible in a manner to achieve the
objective set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 6.02(b)_, and the
Company will use, and will cause its Subsidiaries to use, its and their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the resulting arrangements continue to
permit the facilitation of the planning for the integration and post-Closing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent as fully as
reasonably possible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to provide access to any drafts, opinions, valuations, memorandum,
correspondence or any other materials of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives relating to the negotiation, valuation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the enforcement of, this
Agreement.

 



43 (c) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, AIG, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to hold, all information received,
directly or indirectly, from the Company or its Representatives in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

(d) Subject to _Section 4.27_ and  _Section 5.10_, no investigation by any
of the parties or their respective Representatives, including pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_, shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the others set forth
herein.

Section 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate Merger; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of AIG, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use, and shall

and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things, in each case,
necessary, proper or advisable, to fulfill all conditions applicable to such
party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper or
advisable consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or exemptions from
Governmental Authorities and making all necessary, proper or advisable
registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain a consent, approval, authorization, waiver or exemption from any
Governmental Authority (including under Insurance Laws) and (ii) executing and
delivering any additional agreements, documents or instruments
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of AIG, Parent and the Company shall
use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best
efforts to take any and all actions and do the things necessary, proper or
advisable to avoid impediments under any applicable Law that may be asserted
by, or any Order that may be entered with, any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby and (ii) prevent the
entry of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Order that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated hereby.

 

(c) In furtherance and without limiting the foregoing, AIG and the Company, as
applicable, shall take the following actions within ten (10) Business Days of
the date of this Agreement: (i) AIG shall, together with its "controlled

"). AIG and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide any
requested supplemental information and other related information pursuant to
the DPA, and submit a final CFIUS Notice and other related information
pursuant to the DPA as promptly as practicable after receiving any comments to
the draft CFIUS Notice during the pre-notice consultation process. All filing
fees payable in connection with the foregoing shall be borne by AIG. AIG
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly to provide, or cause to
be provided, all agreements, documents, instruments, affidavits or information
that may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority relating to
AIG or its Subsidiaries or its or their structure, ownership, businesses,
operations, regulatory and legal compliance, assets, liabilities, financing,
financial condition or results of operations, or any of its or their
directors, officers, employees, partners, members or shareholders to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. AIG shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers and employees, to execute and deliver any
"untrustworthy commitment letters". None of AIG, Parent nor Merger Sub shall
at any time prior to the Closing, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, file any application with or request for non-
disapproval by any Governmental Authority with respect to any inter-affiliate
transaction between any Company Insurance Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
AIG or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, that would require approval
or non-disapproval under applicable Law (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement). 

(d) Each of AIG, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that it shall
consult with one another with respect to the obtaining of all consents,
approvals, authorizations, waivers or exemptions of Governmental Authorities
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each of AIG, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall keep
the other apprised on a prompt basis of the status of matters relating to
such consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or exemptions. Each of AIG,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall have the right to review in advance
and, to the extent practicable, and subject to any restrictions under
applicable Law, each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the U.S. Regulatory Filings made in connection the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party agrees to in good faith consider any comments
of the other parties thereon. Each of AIG, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly furnish to each other copies of all such filings and written
materials after their filing or submission, in each case, subject to
applicable Law and with respect to the U.S. Regulatory Filings only.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.03_,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be

 



45  redacted to the extent necessary (i) to remove references concerning AIGs

necessary to comply with written Contracts in effect on the date hereof or
(iii) to address reasonable privilege and confidentiality concerns.

(e) Each of AIG, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly advise

approval, authorization, waiver or exemption is required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the filings made pursuant
to _Section 6.03(c)_, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any
written or electronic communications to the extent related thereto, and shall
promptly advise each other when any such communication causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent,
approval, authorization or waiver will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such consent, approval, authorization, waiver or exemption will be
materially delayed or conditioned.

 

(f) AIG shall give the Company reasonable prior notice of any live or
telephonic meeting with any Governmental Authority (other than the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission) in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry (other than solely ministerial matters)
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give the
Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting (other
than with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that AIG shall have the right to require that the Companys Representatives
not attend or participate in any portion of any such meeting to the extent (i)
concerning AIGs valuation analyses with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with written Contracts in effect on
the date hereof or (iii) to address reasonable privilege and confidentiality
concerns.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Company, AIG or their respective Affiliates be required to agree to
take or enter into any action which would be required to be taken in the event
that the Closing does not occur.

deemed to include, subject to the proviso below, complying with any
requirements of applicable Law or Order or of any Governmental Authority that

Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that, for the purposes of this _Section 6.03_,
"reasonable best efforts" shall not require, or be deemed to require, AIG,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates to agree to or take any action
that would result in (i) with respect to the regulatory approval from the Iowa

Division that would, (A) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) require any capital

the same force and effect that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of AIG and its

 



46  Subsidiaries (not including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a
whole, measured as if AIG and its Subsidiaries were the size of the Company

restrictions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) in this proviso, a "

and review their respective views and positions as to such Burdensome
Condition and (y) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable
Governmental Authority regarding any potential approaches or workarounds that
would avoid such Burdensome Condition or mitigate its impact so it is no
longer a Burdensome Condition.

Section 6.04 _Stockholder Consent; Information Statement; Proxy Statement_.

(b) In the event the Stockholder Written Consent is delivered to Parent, as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, an Information
Statement (including therein a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with

the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Information Statement or for additional information and shall consult with
Parent regarding, and supply Parent with copies of, all correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the

or supplement to the Information Statement, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document. If any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which

Statement, so that the Information

 



47  Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC

file with the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in
the form previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and
mail to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable the Information
Statement.

(c) In the event the Stockholder Written Consent is not delivered to Parent
and Parent does not terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.01(c)_, then as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Written
Consent Delivery Period, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, preliminary proxy materials
which shall constitute the Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after

Company and Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the
Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and the Company shall file
any required amendments to the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for

and shall consult with Parent regarding, and supply Parent with copies
of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing any proposed
amendment of or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC as promptly as practicable and shall thereafter mail to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as practicable the Proxy Statement and all other
proxy materials for the Company Stockholders Meeting.

the Merger under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.05 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. In the event the Stockholder
Written Consent is not delivered to Parent and Parent does not terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(c)_, the Company, acting through
the Company Board of Directors, shall take

 



48  all actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company By-laws and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering
and voting upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 6.06_ (i)
the Company Board of Directors shall recommend that the Company Stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
(the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to AIG, the Company Recommendation.
Unless this Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the
terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board of
Directors to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to AIG under
circumstances as specified in _Section 6.06_, take all lawful action to
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Company
Stockholders that are required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange
and the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, to solicit
additional shares to attend and vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Section 6.06 _Takeover Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its directors and officers shall not,
(ii) its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries directors and officers shall not
and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its and its
Subsidiaries other Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
confidential information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal, (C) enter
into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring, directly or
indirectly, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (D) publicly propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote,
in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal received after the
date hereof that did not result from a material breach of this _Section
6.06_, if the Company Board of Directors determines after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to), subject to compliance with  _Section 6.06(c)_, (1)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such

 



49  Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement containing provisions (including standstill provisions) not less
restrictive with respect to the Person making such Takeover Proposal than
those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement are to AIG and its
Subsidiaries, provided that all such information has previously been provided
to AIG or Parent or is provided to AIG or Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and
(2) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal,
if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (1)
and (2) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to AIG), or publicly propose
to withdraw or withhold (or modify in a manner adverse to AIG), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)
recommend or endorse the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or
publicly propose to recommend, endorse, approve or adopt, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "; it being understood that any "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change) or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any Takeover Proposal Documentation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the
Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, (1)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) cause or permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an agreement regarding a
Superior Proposal if and only if (I) the Company has complied in all material
respects with this _Section 6.06_ and shall have given Parent written notice
at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking such action (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ "), that the Company Board of Directors intends to take
such action in response to a Superior Proposal and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the most current version of any proposed agreement or, if
there is no such proposed written agreement, a reasonably detailed summary of
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and (II) during such
four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives to amend this Agreement in such a manner that any Takeover
Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is
a Superior Proposal taking into account any changes to the financial terms and
other material terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing to the
Company following the Notice of Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with this  _Section 6.06(b)_,
except that reference to the four (4) Business Day period shall be deemed a
reference to a new two (2) Business Day period).

 



50 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.06(a)_ and  _Section 6.06(b)_, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal
after the date of this Agreement, provide a copy of the Takeover Proposal,
including any proposed draft agreement or term sheet submitted in connection
therewith (or, where such copy is not available, a reasonably detailed summary
of the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal) and the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48
hours) of any material developments with respect to any such Takeover
Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and shall as promptly as
practicable provide Parent copies of any written communications that describe
any material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of
Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change
in Circumstance, if and only if (i) the Company Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company shall have given Parent written
notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such Adverse
Recommendation Change, (iii) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend this Agreement
and (iv) after considering any proposed revisions to this Agreement made by
Parent in writing during such four (4) Business Day period, if any, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, the Company
Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to
make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Change in
Circumstance would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
Law.

(e) Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.06_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, it being understood, however, that this
clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board of Directors to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to
in clause (ii) of _Section 6.06(b)_ except, in each case, to the extent
permitted by _Section 6.06(b)_ or _Section 6.06(d)_.

Section 6.07 _Credit Agreement Amendment or Arrangement_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Company agrees to use reasonable best
efforts (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain the best
commercial terms then reasonably available) and in consultation with Parent to

(A) obtain an amendment (the " _Amendment_ ") to the Credit Agreement, dated
as of August 26, 2014 (the " _Credit Agreement_ "), by and among Fidelity and
Guaranty Life Holdings, Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent, and
the lenders party thereto or (B) enter into new definitive financing
arrangements (the " _New Financing_ "), in either case that provide for
immediately available funds as of and following the Closing Date, which are
sufficient to make all of the payments pursuant to Section 3.9 of the Company
Indenture if all of the Notes were properly tendered.

 



51 (b) Notwithstanding this _Section 6.07_ or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it is not a condition to the
Closing that the Amendment or the New Financing be obtained.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) shall be required to (A) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement, (B) incur any liability in connection with
the Amendment or the New Financing prior to the Closing, (C) take any action
that would require any director, officer or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to execute any document, agreement, certificate or instrument
that would be effective prior to the Closing or (D) pay any consent or
similar fees with respect to the Amendment or the New Financing that are not
contingent on, and payable at, the Closing or (ii) shall execute any document,
agreement, certificate or instrument relating to the Amendment or the New
Financing without the prior written consent of AIG.

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall agree on a
press release announcing the entering into of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements (including scheduling of a press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement (a) as may be required by Law or Order, (b) as may be required by
the applicable rules or any listing agreement of the New York Stock Exchange
or any other stock exchange on which securities of a party are listed or
admitted for trading, (c) as requested in writing by any Governmental
Authority or (d) to enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries specified by
Parent in writing reasonably in advance of the Closing and in any event at
least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, in each case effective at
the Effective Time.

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is an
employee of the Company or a Subsidiary at the Closing Date (each such
employee, a " _Company Employee_ "), with (i) base salary and
incentive opportunities (other than with respect to any equity incentive
opportunities) that are, in each case, no less favorable than those applicable
to each such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
retirement and welfare benefits that are not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those retirement and welfare benefits provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



52 (b) Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date
with severance payments and severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance payments and severance benefits to which such employees would
have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance
policies of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, as
set forth in Section 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the

Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to give Company Employees
full credit for Company Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the
level of benefits (including, for purposes of vacation and severance), but not
for purposes of benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, under
any benefit plans made generally available to officers or employees or any
class or level of officers or employees maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a Company
Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan
of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent that provides health benefits in which
Company Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date,
other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees
as of the Closing Date under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent
such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(f) Effective as of the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall be solely responsible for any and
all obligations arising under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985 with respect to each individual who is

 



53  an "MandA qualified beneficiary" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
54.4980B-9) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as a result of such individuals employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(g) This _Section 6.10_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section
6.10_ or any other provision of this Agreement or any other related Contract,
express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(ii) except as expressly provided by _Section 6.10(b)_, shall alter or limit
the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or (iii) is intended to or shall confer upon any
current or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other
person any right to employment or continued employment or service for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement or any other related agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

 

Section 6.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless to the fullest extent provided under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company By-laws in effect on the date hereof and
permitted by the DGCL all past and present directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those persons who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been made available or
delivered to Parent) with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as those of such current insurance coverage; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of the amount set forth
on Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Maximum Premium_
"); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if the annual premiums for such insurance
coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
only be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available at
an annual premium not exceeding the Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company
(with Parents consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or Parent may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year
"tail" insurance policy that provides coverage identical in all material
respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not
pay more than the Maximum Premium for such "tail" insurance policy.

(c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of

 



54  the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Further, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are
presently set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
By-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except
as amendments may be required by the DGCL during such period.

 

(d) This _Section 6.11_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and
their respective successors, heirs and representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be amended without the prior written consent of the
applicable Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, heirs and
representatives).

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in _Section 6.10_ and this  _Section 6.11_.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.11_ shall be
in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws,
and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
(or who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby)
with respect to equity securities of the Company.

Section 6.13 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give AIG or Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct AIGs or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company, AIG and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



55 Section 6.14 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board of Directors
shall, if any state takeover Law or similar Law or any takeover-related
provision in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company By-laws
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than those arising under
insurance acquisition of control Laws), use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this

liability or obligation on the part of AIG, Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, except that (a) the provisions of  _Section 6.02(b)_, _Section
8.02_, this _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ shall survive termination and (b)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability (i) for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement, (ii) for the failure of a party to close
the Merger in accordance with _Section 2.02_ and _Article VII_ hereof
(provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply to
the failure of a party to close the Merger if such partys conditions to
close the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ have not been satisfied or waived)
or (iii) for fraud; _provided_ , that the provisions of _Section 8.02(b)_
providing for the Company Termination Fee shall constitute an exclusive
remedy with respect to the circumstances set forth therein. For purposes of
this Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach
that is a consequence of (A) an act or (B) the failure to take an act
required by the terms of this Agreement, by the breaching party with knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the taking of such act, or the failure to take
such required act, would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a breach
of this Agreement.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the 

 



61  Delaware Secretary; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Company
Required Vote shall have been obtained, no such amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further

or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all
of the parties.

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company, AIG, Parent and Merger Sub may (a) extend the time for

party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 8.04_, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

irreparable damage would occur and that the parties hereto would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any provision of this Agreement were

entitled to injunctive or other

 



65  equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware
Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties hereto further agree that (a) by seeking any
remedy provided for in this _Section 9.09_, a party hereto shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be

for (or limit such partys right to institute any action for) specific
performance under this _Section 9.09_ before exercising any other right under
this Agreement.

Section 9.10  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by the Delaware Courts or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 9.11 _Controlling Language of this Agreement_. This Agreement has

Section 9.13 _AIG Obligation_. AIG shall cause the full and complete
performance by Parent of all of its obligations pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and in the event Parent does not fulfill all of its obligations

terms of this Agreement. AIG further agrees that its obligations set forth in
the preceding sentence will not be discharged except by the full and complete
performance of all of the obligations of Parent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of _Section 8.01(i)_ and _Section
8.03_ hereof shall apply mutatis mutandis to AIG with respect to any
unperformed obligations of Parent or any breach of any representations or
warranties of Parent in this Agreement as fully as if Parent were performing
such obligations or making such representations or warranties. From and after
the date hereof and for as long as any obligations of Parent remain
outstanding hereunder, in the event that Parent or its successors or assigns
(a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (b) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person in one or a series of transactions, then, and in each
such case, AIG shall, at

 



66  its option either assume, or cause such Person(s) to assume, by a written
instrument entered into for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Company or
the Persons referred to in Section 9.04(b), the obligations of Parent.
