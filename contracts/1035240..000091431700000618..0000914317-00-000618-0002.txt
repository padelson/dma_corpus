2.7      Merger Consideration
         --------------------

         (a) As used  herein,  the term  "Merger  Consideration"  shall mean the
number  of  shares  of BB&T  Common  Stock to be  exchanged  for  each  share of
FirstSpartan  Common Stock issued and  outstanding  as of the Effective Time and
cash (without  interest) to be payable in exchange for any  fractional  share of
BB&T  Common  Stock that would  otherwise  be  distributable  to a  FirstSpartan
shareholder as provided in Section  2.7(b).  The number of shares of BB&T Common
Stock to be issued for each issued and outstanding share of FirstSpartan  Common
Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") shall be 1.0.

         (b) The amount of cash payable with respect to any fractional  share of
BB&T Common Stock shall be determined by multiplying the fractional part of such
share by the Closing Value. The "Closing Value" shall mean the 4:00 p.m. eastern
time  closing  price per share of BB&T  Common  Stock on the NYSE on the Closing
Date as reported on NYSEnet.com.

2.8      Conversion of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration
         -----------------------------------------------------

         (a) At the  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the Merger and  without  any
action on the part of  FirstSpartan  or the  holders  of record of  FirstSpartan
Common Stock,  each share of  FirstSpartan  Common Stock issued and  outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  shall be  converted  into and  shall
represent the right to receive,  upon surrender of the certificate  representing
such share of  FirstSpartan  Common Stock (as provided in subsection (d) below),
the Merger Consideration.

         (b) Each share of BB&T Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding.

         (c) Until surrendered,  each outstanding certificate which prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more shares of FirstSpartan Common Stock shall
be deemed upon the Effective  Time for all purposes to represent  only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.  No interest will be paid or accrued on the
Merger  Consideration  upon the  surrender of the  certificate  or  certificates
representing   shares  of  FirstSpartan   Common  Stock.  With  respect  to  any
certificate for FirstSpartan Common Stock that has been lost or destroyed,  BB&T
shall pay the Merger Consideration attributable to such certificate upon receipt
of a surety bond or other  adequate  indemnity  as required in  accordance  with
BB&T's  standard  policy,  and  evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to  BB&T  of
ownership  of  the  shares  represented  thereby.   After  the  Effective  Time,
FirstSpartan's  transfer  books shall be closed and no transfer of the shares of
FirstSpartan  Common Stock  outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

         (d) Promptly after the Effective Time, BB&T shall cause to be delivered
or mailed to each  FirstSpartan  shareholder a form of letter of transmittal and
instructions  for


                                       9
<PAGE>


use in effecting the surrender of the certificates  which,  immediately prior to
the Effective Time,  represented any shares of FirstSpartan  Common Stock.  Upon
proper surrender of such certificates or other evidence of ownership meeting the
requirements  of Section 2.8(c),  together with such letter of transmittal  duly
executed and completed in accordance  with the  instructions  thereto,  and such
other  documents as may be reasonably  requested,  BB&T shall promptly cause the
transfer to the persons entitled thereto of the Merger Consideration.

         (e)  The  Surviving  Corporation  shall  pay  any  dividends  or  other
distributions  with a record  date  prior to the  Effective  Time that have been
declared or made by  FirstSpartan  in respect of shares of  FirstSpartan  Common
Stock in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement and that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time,  subject to compliance by FirstSpartan  with Section 5.9(b).
To the extent  permitted by law,  former  shareholders of record of FirstSpartan
shall be  entitled  to vote  after the  Effective  Time at any  meeting  of BB&T
shareholders  the number of whole  shares of BB&T Common  Stock into which their
respective  shares of  FirstSpartan  Common Stock are  converted,  regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their certificates representing FirstSpartan
Common Stock for certificates  representing BB&T Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.  Whenever a dividend or other  distribution is
declared  by BB&T on the BB&T Common  Stock,  the record date for which is at or
after the Effective  Time,  the  declaration  shall  include  dividends or other
distributions  on all shares of BB&T  Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  but no  dividend  or other  distribution  payable to the  holders of
record of BB&T Common  Stock as of any time  subsequent  to the  Effective  Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any  certificate  representing  FirstSpartan
Common  Stock until such holder  surrenders  such  certificate  for  exchange as
provided in this Section 2.8. Upon surrender of such certificate,  both the BB&T
Common Stock certificate and any undelivered dividends and cash payments payable
hereunder  (without  interest)  shall be delivered  and paid with respect to the
shares of FirstSpartan Common Stock represented by such certificate.

2.9      Conversion of Stock Options
         ---------------------------

         (a) At the  Effective  Time,  each Stock Option then  outstanding  (and
which by its terms does not lapse on or before the Effective  Time),  whether or
not then exercisable,  shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
BB&T Common Stock,  and BB&T shall assume each Stock Option in  accordance  with
the terms of the Stock  Option  Plan,  except that from and after the  Effective
Time  (i)  BB&T  and  its  Compensation   Committee  shall  be  substituted  for
FirstSpartan  and its Compensation  Committee with respect to administering  the
Stock  Option  Plan,  (ii) each Stock  Option  assumed by BB&T may be  exercised
solely  for  shares of BB&T  Common  Stock,  (iii) the  number of shares of BB&T
Common  Stock  subject  to each such Stock  Option  shall be the number of whole
shares of BB&T (omitting any  fractional  share)  determined by multiplying  the
number of shares of  FirstSpartan  Common  Stock  subject to such  Stock  Option
immediately  prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and (iv) the per
share  exercise price under each such Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing
the per share  exercise price under


                                       10
<PAGE>


each such Stock  Option by the  Exchange  Ratio and  rounding  up to the nearest
cent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  BB&T may at its election substitute as of
the  Effective  Time  options  under the BB&T  Corporation  1995  Omnibus  Stock
Incentive  Plan or any other duly adopted  comparable  plan (in either case, the
"BB&T  Option  Plan")  for all or a part of the Stock  Options,  subject  to the
following conditions: (A) the requirements of (iii) and (iv) above shall be met;
(B) such substitution shall not constitute a modification,  extension or renewal
of any of the Stock Options;  and (C) the substituted  options shall continue in
effect  on the same  terms  and  conditions  as  provided  in the  Stock  Option
Agreements and the Stock Option Plan governing each Stock Option.  Each grant of
a converted or substitute  option to any individual who subsequent to the Merger
will be a director or officer of BB&T as construed  under  Commission Rule 16b-3
shall,  as a  condition  to such  conversion  or  substitution,  be  approved in
accordance  with the  provisions  of Rule 16b-3.  Each Stock  Option which is an
incentive stock option shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code,
and the Regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  so as to continue as an incentive
stock option under  Section  424(a) of the Code,  and so as not to  constitute a
modification,  extension, or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section
424(h) of the Code. BB&T and  FirstSpartan  agree to take all necessary steps to
effectuate  the foregoing  provisions of this Section 2.9. BB&T has reserved and
shall continue to reserve adequate shares of BB&T Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of any converted or substitute  options.  As soon as practicable  after
the  Effective  Time,  if it  has  not  already  done  so,  and  to  the  extent
FirstSpartan  shall have a registration  statement in effect or an obligation to
file a registration statement,  BB&T shall file a registration statement on Form
S-3 or Form  S-8,  as the case  may be (or any  successor  or other  appropriate
forms),  with respect to the shares of BB&T Common Stock subject to converted or
substitute  options  and  shall  use its  reasonable  efforts  to  maintain  the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses  contained therein) for so long as such converted
or substitute options remain outstanding.  With respect to those individuals, if
any, who  subsequent to the Merger may be subject to the reporting  requirements
under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, BB&T shall  administer the Stock Option
Plan  assumed  pursuant  to this  Section  2.9  (or the  BB&T  Option  Plan,  if
applicable)  in a manner that  complies  with Rule 16b-3  promulgated  under the
Exchange  Act to the extent  necessary  to  preserve  for such  individuals  the
benefits of Rule 16b-3 to the extent such benefits were  available to them prior
to the Effective Time. FirstSpartan hereby represents that the Stock Option Plan
in its current form complies with Rule 16b-3 to the extent,  if any, required as
of the date hereof.

         (b) As soon as  practicable  following the Effective  Time,  BB&T shall
deliver to the participants  receiving  converted  options under the BB&T Option
Plan an appropriate  notice  setting forth such  participant's  rights  pursuant
thereto.

         (c) Eligibility to receive stock option grants  following the Effective
Time with respect to BB&T Common Stock shall be determined by BB&T in accordance
with its plans and procedures as in effect from time to time, and subject to any
contractual obligations.

         ----------------------

         In the event  that BB&T  shall  request,  FirstSpartan  shall take such
actions, and shall cause the FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries to take such actions, as
may be required in order to effect,  at the Effective Time, the merger of one or
more of the  FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries  with and into, in each case, one of the
BB&T Subsidiaries.

2.11     Anti-Dilution
         -------------

         In the event BB&T  changes  the number of shares of BB&T  Common  Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock  dividend or other similar  recapitalization,  and the record date thereof
(in the case of a stock  dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of
a stock  split  or  similar  recapitalization  for  which a  record  date is not
established)  shall be prior to the Effective  Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted.

Laws, against FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary or against any person
or entity  whose  liability  for any  Environmental  Claim  FirstSpartan  or any

Subsidiaries  are valid and  properly  documented  and were made in the ordinary
course of  business,  and the security  therefor,  if any, is valid and properly
perfected.  Neither the terms of such loans, nor any of the loan  documentation,
nor the  manner in which such loans have been  administered  and  serviced,  nor
FirstSpartan's   procedures   and  practices  of  approving  or  rejecting  loan

3.13     Tax Matters
         -----------

         (a) FirstSpartan  and the  FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries and each of their
predecessors  have timely  filed (or requests  for  extensions  have been timely
filed and any such  extensions  either are pending or have been granted and have
not expired)  all federal,  state and local (and,  if  applicable,  foreign) tax
returns  required  by  applicable  law to be filed by them  (including,  without
limitation,  estimated tax returns, income tax returns,


                                       17
<PAGE>


information  returns, and withholding and employment tax returns) and have paid,
or where  payment is not  required  to have been made,  have set up an  adequate
reserve or accrual for the payment of, all taxes  required to be paid in respect
of the periods  covered by such returns and, as of the Effective Time, will have
paid,  or where  payment is not required to have been made,  will have set up an
adequate  reserve or accrual for the  payment  of, all taxes for any  subsequent
periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time.  Neither  FirstSpartan nor any
FirstSpartan  Subsidiary  has or will have any  liability  for any such taxes in
excess  of  the  amounts  so  paid  or  reserves  or  accruals  so  established.
FirstSpartan  and the FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries  have paid, or where payment is
not  required to have been made have set up an  adequate  reserve or accrual for
payment  of, all taxes  required  to be paid or  accrued  for the  preceding  or

         (b) All  federal,  state and local (and,  if  applicable,  foreign) tax
returns filed by FirstSpartan and the FirstSpartan Subsidiaries are complete and
accurate.  Neither FirstSpartan nor any FirstSpartan Subsidiary is delinquent in
the payment of any tax,  assessment or governmental  charge. No deficiencies for
any tax,  assessment  or  governmental  charge have been  proposed,  asserted or
assessed  (tentatively or otherwise)  against  FirstSpartan or any  FirstSpartan
Subsidiary  which  have not been  settled  and  paid.  There  are  currently  no
agreements in effect with respect to FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan Subsidiary
to extend the period of limitations for the assessment or collection of any tax.
No audit  examination  or deficiency or refund  litigation  with respect to such
returns is pending.

         (c) Deferred taxes with respect to  FirstSpartan  and the  FirstSpartan
Subsidiaries  have  been  provided  for in  accordance  with  GAAP  consistently
applied.

         (d) Neither FirstSpartan nor any of the FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries is a
party to any tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than among  FirstSpartan
and the  FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries) or has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a  consolidated  federal income tax return (other than a group the common
parent  of which  was  FirstSpartan  or a  FirstSpartan  subsidiary)  or has any
liability for taxes of any person (other than  FirstSpartan and the FirstSpartan
Subsidiaries)  under  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.1502-6  (or  any  similar
provision of state,  local or foreign  law) as a  transferee  or successor or by
contract or otherwise.

         (e)  Each of  FirstSpartan  and  the  FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries  is in
compliance   with,  and  its  records  contain  all  information  and  documents
(including  properly  completed  IRS Forms W-9)  necessary to comply  with,  all
applicable information reporting and tax withholding requirements under federal,
state,  and local tax laws,  and such  records  identify  with  specificity  all
accounts subject to backup withholding under Section 3406 of the Code.

         (f) Neither  FirstSpartan nor any of the FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries has
made any  payments,  is  obligated  to make any  payments,  or is a party to any
contract that could


                                       18

obligate it to make any payments that would be  disallowed as a deduction  under
Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

3.14     Employees; Compensation; Benefit Plans
         --------------------------------------

         (a)  Compensation.  FirstSpartan  has  Disclosed a complete and correct
list of the  name,  age,  position,  rate  of  compensation  and  any  incentive
compensation  arrangements,  bonuses or commissions or fringe or other benefits,
whether payable in cash or in kind, of each director,  shareholder,  independent
contractor,  consultant  and  agent  of  FirstSpartan  and of each  FirstSpartan
Subsidiary  and each other  person (in each case other than as an  employee)  to
whom  FirstSpartan or any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary pays or provides,  or has an
obligation,  agreement  (written or unwritten),  policy or practice of paying or
providing,  retirement,  health,  welfare  or  other  benefits  of any  kind  or
description whatsoever.

         (b)      Employee Benefit Plans.
                  ----------------------

                  (i)  FirstSpartan  has Disclosed an accurate and complete list
         of all Plans, as defined below, contributed to, maintained or sponsored
         by FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary,  to which FirstSpartan
         or any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary  is obligated to contribute or has any
         liability or potential liability, whether direct or indirect, including
         all Plans contributed to, maintained or sponsored by each member of the
         controlled  group of  corporations,  within  the  meaning  of  Sections
         414(b), 414(c), 414(m) and 414(o) of the Code, of which FirstSpartan or
         any  FirstSpartan   Subsidiary  is  a  member.  For  purposes  of  this
         Agreement, the term "Plan" shall mean a plan, arrangement, agreement or
         program   described  in  the  foregoing   provisions  of  this  Section
         3.14(b)(i)  that  is:  (A)  a  profit-sharing,  deferred  compensation,
         employee stock ownership, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, pension,
         retainer, consulting, retirement, severance, welfare or incentive plan,
         agreement  or  arrangement,  whether or not  funded and  whether or not
         terminated,  (B) an  employment  agreement,  (C) a personnel  policy or
         fringe  benefit  plan,  policy,  program or  arrangement  providing for
         benefits  or  perquisites  to  current or former  employees,  officers,
         directors  or  agents,  whether  or  not  funded,  and  whether  or not
         terminated,   including,  without  limitation,   benefits  relating  to
         automobiles,  clubs, vacation, child care, parenting,  sabbatical, sick
         leave, severance, medical, dental, hospitalization,  life insurance and
         other types of  insurance,  or (D) any other  employee  benefit plan as
         defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,  whether or not funded and whether or
         not terminated.

                  (ii)  Neither  FirstSpartan  nor any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary
         contributes to, has an obligation to contribute to or otherwise has any
         liability or potential  liability with respect to (A) any multiemployer
         plan as  defined in  Section  3(37) of ERISA,  (B) any plan of the type
         described  in Sections  4063 and 4064 of ERISA or in Section 413 of the
         Code (and regulations  promulgated  thereunder),  or (C) any plan which
         provides  health,  life  insurance,  accident  or other  "welfare-type"


                                       19
<PAGE>


         benefits  to  current  or  future  retirees  or  former   employees  or
         directors,  their spouses or dependents,  other than in accordance with
         Section 4980B of the Code or  applicable  state  continuation  coverage
         law.

                  (iii)  None  of  the  Plans  obligates   FirstSpartan  or  any
         FirstSpartan  Subsidiary to pay separation,  severance,  termination or
         similar-type   benefits   solely  as  a  result   of  any   transaction
         contemplated  by this  Agreement  or solely as a result of a "change in
         control,"  as  such  term  is used in  Section  280G of the  Code  (and
         regulations promulgated thereunder).

                  (iv) Each Plan, and all related  trusts,  insurance  contracts
         and funds, has been  maintained,  funded and administered in compliance
         in all respects  with its own terms and in  compliance  in all respects
         with all applicable laws and regulations,  including but not limited to
         ERISA and the Code. No actions,  suits,  claims,  complaints,  charges,
         proceedings, hearings, examinations,  investigations, audits or demands
         with respect to the Plans (other than routine  claims for benefits) are
         pending or threatened,  and there are no facts which could give rise to
         or be expected to give rise to any actions, suits, claims,  complaints,
         charges, proceedings, hearings, examinations, investigations, audits or
         demands. No Plan that is subject to the funding requirements of Section
         412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA has incurred  any  "accumulated
         funding  deficiency"  as such term is defined in such Sections of ERISA
         and the Code, whether or not waived, and each Plan has always fully met
         the funding  standards  required under Title I of ERISA and Section 412
         of the Code. No liability to the Pension Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation
         ("PBGC")  (except  for  routine  payment  of  premiums)  has been or is
         expected  to be  incurred  with  respect to any Plan that is subject to
         Title IV of ERISA,  no  reportable  event (as such term is  defined  in
         Section  4043 of ERISA)  for which the PBGC has not  waived  notice has
         occurred with respect to any such Plan,  and the PBGC has not commenced
         or  threatened  the  termination  of any  Plan.  None of the  assets of
         FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary is the subject of any lien
         arising  under Section  302(f) of ERISA or Section  412(n) of the Code,
         neither FirstSpartan nor any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary has been required
         to post any  security  pursuant  to  Section  307 of  ERISA or  Section
         401(a)(29) of the Code,  and there are no facts which could be expected
         to give rise to such lien or such  posting  of  security.  No event has
         occurred and no condition exists that would subject FirstSpartan or any
         FirstSpartan  Subsidiary to any tax under  Sections 4971,  4972,  4976,
         4977 or 4979 of the Code or to a fine or penalty under  Section  502(c)
         of ERISA.

                  (v) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified  under  Section
         401(a) of the Code or, in the case of an employee stock ownership plan,
         qualifies as such under Section  4975(c)(7) of the Code, and each trust
         (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination
         letter from the IRS as to the qualification under the Code of such Plan
         and the tax  exempt  status of such  related  trust,  and  nothing  has
         occurred  since  the  date  of such  determination  letter


                                       20
<PAGE>


         that could adversely  affect the  qualification of such Plan or the tax
         exempt status of such related trust.

                  (vi) No  underfunded  "defined  benefit plan" (as such term is
         defined  in  Section  3(35) of ERISA)  has been,  during the five years
         preceding the Closing Date,  transferred out of the controlled group of
         corporations  (within the meaning of Sections 414(b),  (c), (m) and (o)
         of the Code) of which FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary is a
         member or was a member during such five-year period.

                  (vii) As of June 30, 1999, the fair market value of the assets
         of each Plan that is a tax  qualified  defined  benefit plan equaled or
         exceeded,  and as of the Closing Date will equal or exceed, the present
         value of all vested and nonvested liabilities  thereunder determined in
         accordance with reasonable  actuarial methods,  factors and assumptions
         applicable to a defined benefit plan on an ongoing basis.  With respect
         to each Plan that is subject to the funding requirements of Section 412
         of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA,  all required  contributions  for
         all  periods  ending  prior  to or as of the  Closing  Date  (including
         periods from the first day of the then-current plan year to the Closing
         Date and including all quarterly  contributions  required in accordance
         with Section 412(m) of the Code) shall have been made.  With respect to
         each  other  Plan,  all  required  payments,  premiums,  contributions,
         reimbursements or accruals for all periods ending prior to or as of the
         Closing  Date  shall  have been  made.  No tax  qualified  Plan has any
         unfunded liabilities.

                  (viii)  No  prohibited   transaction  (which  shall  mean  any
         transaction  prohibited  by Section  406 of ERISA and not exempt  under
         Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, whether by statutory,
         class or  individual  exemption)  has occurred with respect to any Plan
         which would result in the  imposition,  directly or indirectly,  of any
         excise tax,  penalty or other  liability under Section 4975 of the Code
         or Section  409 or 502(i) of ERISA.  Neither  FirstSpartan  nor, to the
         best  knowledge  of  FirstSpartan,  any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary,  any
         trustee,  administrator  or other  fiduciary  of any  Plan  (including,
         without  limitation,  The First Federal Bank Employee  Stock  Ownership
         Plan (the "ESOP")), or any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in
         any  transaction  or acted or  failed  to act in a  manner  that  could
         subject  FirstSpartan or any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary to any liability
         for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable law.

                  (ix) With  respect to each Plan,  all reports and  information
         required to be filed with any government  agency or distributed to Plan
         participants and their beneficiaries have been duly and timely filed or
         distributed.

                  (x) FirstSpartan and each FirstSpartan Subsidiary has been and
         is  presently in  compliance  with all of the  requirements  of Section
         4980B of the Code.


                                       21
<PAGE>


                  (xi) Neither FirstSpartan nor any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary has
         a  liability  as of June 30,  1999 under any Plan  that,  to the extent
         disclosure is required under GAAP, is not reflected on the consolidated
         balance sheet included in the Financial  Statements of  FirstSpartan as
         of June 30, 1999 or otherwise Disclosed.

                  (xii)  Neither the  consideration  nor  implementation  of the
         transactions  contemplated  under  this  Agreement  will  increase  (A)
         FirstSpartan's  or any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary's  obligation  to make
         contributions  or any other payments to fund benefits accrued under the
         Plans as of the date of this  Agreement or (B) the benefits  accrued or
         payable with respect to any participant  under the Plans (except to the
         extent  benefits  may  be  deemed  increased  by  accelerated  vesting,
         accelerated  allocation of previously unallocated Plan assets or by the
         conversion of all stock options in accordance with Section 2.9).

                  (xiii) With respect to each Plan,  FirstSpartan  has Disclosed
         or made available to BB&T, true, complete and correct copies of (A) all
         documents  pursuant  to which  the  Plans are  maintained,  funded  and
         administered,  including summary plan descriptions,  (B) the three most
         recent  annual  reports  (Form  5500  series)  filed with the IRS (with
         attachments),  (C) the three most recent actuarial reports, if any, (D)
         the  three  most  recent  financial  statements,  (E) all  governmental
         filings for the last three years, including, without limitation, excise
         tax returns and reportable  events  filings,  and (F) all  governmental
         rulings,  determinations,   and  opinions  (and  pending  requests  for
         governmental  rulings,  determinations,  and opinions)  during the past
         three years.

                  (xiv)  Each of the Plans as applied  to  FirstSpartan  and any
         FirstSpartan  Subsidiary  may be amended or  terminated  at any time by
         action of  FirstSpartan's  Board of Directors,  or such  FirstSpartan's
         Subsidiary's Board of Directors,  as the case may be, or a committee of
         such  Board of  Directors  or duly  authorized  officer,  in each  case
         subject to the terms of the Plan and compliance  with  applicable  laws
         and regulations (and limited,  in the case of  multiemployer  plans, to
         termination  of the  participation  of  FirstSpartan  or a FirstSpartan
         Subsidiary thereunder).

                  (xv) The ESOP was adopted in July 1997. FirstSpartan will take
         all  steps  necessary  to  cause  any loan (as  described  in  Treasury
         Regulation  ss.54.4975-7(b)(1)(ii)) made to the ESOP to be satisfied in
         full as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.

         -----------------

         (a) Neither FirstSpartan nor any FirstSpartan Subsidiary is a party to,

executive officer or 5% shareholder of FirstSpartan or any person,  corporation,
or enterprise controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the

applicable moratorium, fair price, business combination,  control share or other
anti-takeover laws, and no such law shall be activated or applied as a result of
such  transactions.  Neither the Certificate of Incorporation  nor the Bylaws of

activity.

recommendation only if the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith that
such  recommendation  should  not be  made in  light  of its  fiduciary  duty to
FirstSpartan's  shareholders after  consideration of (i) written advice of legal
counsel  that such  recommendation  or the  failure to  withdraw  or modify such
recommendation  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  constitute  a breach of the
fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors to the  shareholders  of  FirstSpartan,
and (ii) a written  determination  from the  Financial  Advisor  that the Merger
Consideration is not fair or is inadequate to the FirstSpartan shareholders from
a financial point of view, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the reasons for

Registration  Statement).  The Registration  Statement shall include the form of
Proxy  Statement/Prospectus.  BB&T and  FirstSpartan  shall  use all  reasonable

the FirstSpartan shareholders, and such Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall, on the
date of mailing,  conform in all material  respects to the  requirements  of the
Securities  Laws and the  applicable  rules and  regulations  of the  Commission

practicable  following  BB&T's  receipt  of notice  thereof,  if a stop order is
issued   with   respect   to   the   Registration   Statement   or   the   Proxy

adopted  the Plan of  Merger  and (ii) will pay or cause to be paid when due the
Merger  Consideration.  BB&T has reserved for issuance  such number of shares of
BB&T Common  Stock as shall be  necessary  to pay the Merger  Consideration  and
agrees  not to take  any  action  that  would  cause  the  aggregate  number  of
authorized  shares of BB&T Common Stock available for issuance  hereunder not to
be  sufficient  to effect the  Merger.  If at any time the  aggregate  number of
shares of BB&T Common Stock reserved for issuance hereunder is not sufficient to
effect the Merger,  BB&T shall take all appropriate action as may be required to
increase the number of shares of BB&T Common Stock reserved for such purpose.

contemplated  hereby,  provided that such modifications do not change the Merger
Consideration or abrogate the covenants and other  agreements  contained in this
Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  the covenant not to take any action
that would  substantially delay or impair the prospects of completing the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger.

         (b) As  promptly  as  practicable  after  the  date  hereof,  BB&T  and
FirstSpartan  shall  submit  notice or  applications  for prior  approval of the

each  represents  and  warrants to the other that all  information  included (or
submitted for inclusion) concerning it, its respective Subsidiaries,  and any of
its respective directors, officers and shareholders,  shall be true, correct and
complete in all material  respects as of the date  presented.  FirstSpartan  and
BB&T shall  provide  promptly to each other  copies of all  correspondence  with
regulatory bodies to which notices or applications are submitted.

5.5      Best Efforts
         ------------

         Each of BB&T and FirstSpartan  shall use, and shall cause each of their
respective  Subsidiaries  to use,  its best efforts in good faith to (i) furnish
such  information as may be required in connection with and otherwise  cooperate
in the preparation  and filing of the documents  referred to in Sections 5.2 and
5.4 or elsewhere herein, and (ii) take or cause to be taken all action necessary
or desirable  on its part to fulfill the  conditions  in Article VI,  including,
without  limitation,  executing  and  delivering,  or causing to be executed and
delivered, such representations, certificates and other instruments or documents
as may be reasonably requested by BB&T's legal counsel for such counsel to issue
the opinion  contemplated by Section 6.1(e),  and to consummate the transactions
herein contemplated at the earliest possible date. Neither BB&T nor FirstSpartan
shall  take,  or cause,  or to the best of its ability  permit to be taken,  any
action that would  substantially delay or impair the prospects of completing the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger.

5.6      Certain Accounting Matters
         --------------------------

         FirstSpartan  shall  cooperate with BB&T  concerning (i) accounting and
financial matters necessary or appropriate to facilitate the Merger (taking into
account  BB&T's  policies,   practices  and  procedures),   including,   without
limitation,   issues   arising  in   connection   with  record   keeping,   loan
classification,  valuation  adjustments,  levels of loan loss reserves and other
accounting   practices,   and  (ii)   FirstSpartan's   lending,   investment  or
asset/liability management policies; provided, that any action taken pursuant to
this  Section 5.6 shall not be deemed to  constitute  or result in the breach of
any  representation,  warranty  or covenant of  FirstSpartan  contained  in this
Agreement.  FirstSpartan  shall not be  required  to  modify or change  any such
policies  or  practices,  however,  until the  earlier  of (A) such time as BB&T
acknowledges that all conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger have
been waived or satisfied (other than the delivery of certificates,  opinions and
other  instruments  and  documents to be delivered at Closing or otherwise to be
dated at the  Effective  Time,  the  delivery  of which  shall  continue to be a
condition to BB&T's  obligation  to  consummate  the Merger) or (B)  immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

5.7      Access to Information
         ---------------------

         FirstSpartan  and BB&T will each keep the other advised of all material
developments  relevant to its business and the  businesses of its  Subsidiaries,
and to  consummation  of the Merger,  and each shall provide to the other,  upon
request,  reasonable  details of any such development.  Upon reasonable  notice,
FirstSpartan  shall  afford to  representatives  of BB&T access,  during  normal
business  hours during the period  prior to the  Effective  Time,  to all of the
properties,  books,  contracts,  commitments and records of FirstSpartan and the
FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries  and,  during such period,  shall make  available all
information  concerning  their  businesses  as may be reasonably


                                       32
<PAGE>


requested.  No  investigation  pursuant to this  Section 5.7 shall  affect or be
deemed to modify any  representation  or warranty made by, or the  conditions to
the obligations  hereunder of, either party hereto. Each party hereto shall, and
shall cause each of its directors, officers, attorneys and advisors to, maintain
the confidentiality of all information obtained hereunder which is not otherwise
publicly  disclosed  by the other  party,  said  undertakings  with  respect  to
confidentiality to survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1. In the event of the termination of this Agreement,  each party shall return
to  the  other  party  upon  request  all  confidential  information  previously
furnished in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.8      Press Releases
         --------------

         BB&T and  FirstSpartan  shall  agree with each other as to the form and
substance of any press release  related to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and consult with each other
as to the form  and  substance  of other  public  disclosures  related  thereto;
provided,  that nothing contained herein shall prohibit either party,  following
notification to the other party, from making any disclosure which in the opinion
of its counsel is required by law.

5.9      Forbearances of FirstSpartan
         ----------------------------

         Except with the prior written  consent of BB&T (which consent shall not

         BB&T and  FirstSpartan,  be  declared  with a record  date prior to the
         Effective  Time  only if the  normal  record  date for  payment  of the
         corresponding  quarterly  dividend to holders of BB&T  Common  Stock is
         before the Effective Time;

                  (c) issue any shares of its capital stock (including  treasury

         Subsidiary, or permit any such lien, charge or encumbrance to exist; or
         waive or release any material right or cancel or compromise any debt or
         claim, in each case other than in the ordinary course of business;

                  (g) merge with any other  entity or permit any other entity to
         merge into it, or consolidate  with any other entity;  acquire  control
         over any other entity;  or liquidate,  sell or otherwise dispose of any
         assets or acquire any assets other than in the  ordinary  course of its
         business consistent with past practices;

                  (h) fail to  comply  in any  material  respect  with any laws,
         regulations, ordinances or governmental actions applicable to it and to
         the conduct of its business;

                  (i) increase the rate of compensation of any of its directors,
         officers or employees  (excluding  increases in compensation  resulting
         from the exercise of compensatory  stock options  outstanding as of the
         date of this  Agreement),  or pay or  agree  to pay any  bonus  to,  or
         provide any new employee benefit or incentive to, any of its directors,
         officers or  employees,  except for  increases or payments  made in the
         ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice  pursuant to
         plans or arrangements in effect on the date hereof;

                  (j)  enter  into or  substantially  modify  (except  as may be
         required by  applicable  law or  regulation)  any pension,  retirement,
         stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, savings, profit
         sharing, deferred compensation,  consulting,  bonus, group insurance or
         other  employee  benefit,   incentive  or  welfare  contract,  plan  or
         arrangement,  or any trust agreement related thereto, in respect of any
         of its directors, officers or other employees;  provided, however, that
         this  subparagraph  shall not prevent  renewal of any of the  foregoing
         consistent with past practice;

                  (k) solicit or encourage  inquiries or proposals  with respect
         to,  furnish  any  information  relating  to,  or  participate  in  any
         negotiations or discussions concerning,  any acquisition or purchase of
         all or a substantial  portion of the assets of, or a substantial equity

         business  combination with FirstSpartan or any FirstSpartan  Subsidiary
         other than as contemplated by this Agreement; or authorize any officer,
         director,  agent  or  affiliate  of  FirstSpartan  or any  FirstSpartan
         Subsidiary to do any of the above;  or fail to notify BB&T  immediately
         if any such inquiries or proposals are


                                       34
<PAGE>


         received,  any such  information is requested or required,  or any such
         negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated;  provided, that
         this  Section  5.9(k)  shall  not  apply  to  furnishing   information,
         negotiations or discussions  with the offeror  following an unsolicited
         offer if, as a result of such offer, FirstSpartan is advised in writing
         by  legal  counsel  that  the  failure  to so  furnish  information  or
         negotiate  could  reasonably  be expected to constitute a breach of the
         fiduciary duty of FirstSpartan's Board of Directors to the FirstSpartan
         shareholders;

                  (l) enter  into (i) any  material  agreement,  arrangement  or

         course of business  relating to the borrowing of money by  FirstSpartan
         or  a  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary  or  guarantee  by  FirstSpartan  or  a
         FirstSpartan  Subsidiary  of  any  obligation,   (iii)  any  agreement,
         arrangement or commitment  relating to the employment or severance of a
         consultant  or the  employment,  severance,  election or  retention  in
         office of any present or former  director,  officer or  employee  (this
         clause shall not apply to the election of directors by  shareholders or
         the  reappointment  of  officers  in the  normal  course),  or (iv) any
         contract, agreement or understanding with a labor union;

                  (m)  change  its  lending,   investment   or   asset/liability
         management  policies  in any  material  respect,  except  (i) as may be
         required by applicable law,  regulation,  or directives,  and (ii) that
         after  approval  of  the  Agreement  and  the  Plan  of  Merger  by its
         shareholders  and after receipt of the requisite  regulatory  approvals
         for the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement and the Plan of
         Merger,  and subject to Section 5.6,  FirstSpartan  shall  cooperate in
         good  faith  with  BB&T to adopt  policies,  practices  and  procedures
         consistent  with those  utilized  by BB&T,  effective  on or before the
         Closing Date;

                  (n) change its  methods  of  accounting  in effect at June 30,
         1999 in any  material  respect,  except as  required by changes in GAAP
         concurred  in by BB&T,  which  concurrence  shall  not be  unreasonably
         withheld,  or  change  any of  its  methods  of  reporting  income  and
         deductions  for federal  income tax purposes from those employed in the
         preparation  of its federal  income tax returns for the year ended June
         30, 1999, except as required by changes in law or regulation;

                  (o)  incur  any  commitments   for  capital   expenditures  or
         obligation to make capital  expenditures in excess of $25,000,  for any

                  (p) incur any indebtedness other than deposits from customers,
         advances  from  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank and  reverse  repurchase

                                       35
<PAGE>


                  (q) take  any  action  which  would  or  could  reasonably  be
         expected  to (i) cause the Merger not to  constitute  a  reorganization
         under Section 368 of the Code as determined by BB&T, (ii) result in any
         inaccuracy of a representation  or warranty herein that would allow for
         a termination of this  Agreement,  or (iii) cause any of the conditions
         precedent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to fail to
         be satisfied;

                  (r) dispose of any material  assets other than in the ordinary
         course of business; or

                  (s) agree to do any of the foregoing.

5.10     Employment Agreements
         ---------------------

         BB&T (or its specified  BB&T  Subsidiary)  has entered into  employment
agreements with Billy L. Painter in the form of Annex B hereto and with R. Lamar
Simpson, Hugh H. Brantley and J. Stephan Sinclair in the form of Annex C hereto,
all of which shall become effective as of the Effective Time.

5.11     Affiliates
         ----------

         FirstSpartan  shall use its best  efforts to cause all  persons who are
Affiliates of  FirstSpartan to deliver to BB&T promptly  following  execution of
this Agreement,  and in any event prior to the Closing Date, a written agreement
providing that such person will not dispose of BB&T Common Stock received in the
Merger  except  in  compliance  with  the  Securities  Act  and  the  rules  and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

5.12     Section 401(k) Plan; Other Employee Benefits
         --------------------------------------------

         (a)  Effective on the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date with respect to
the 401(k)  plan of  FirstSpartan,  BB&T shall cause such plan to be merged with
the 401(k) plan maintained by BB&T and the BB&T Subsidiaries, or to be frozen or
terminated, in each case as determined by BB&T and subject to the receipt of all
applicable regulatory or governmental  approvals.  Each employee of FirstSpartan
at  the  Effective  Time  who  (i)  is a  participant  in  the  401(k)  plan  of
FirstSpartan,  (ii) becomes an employee immediately following the Effective Time
of BB&T or of any subsidiary of BB&T ("Employer Entity"), and (iii) continues in
the employment of an Employer Entity until the Benefit Plan  Determination  Date
for the 401(k) plan,  shall be eligible to  participate in BB&T's 401(k) plan as
of  such  Benefit  Plan  Determination   Date.  Any  other  former  employee  of
FirstSpartan who is employed by an Employer Entity on or after such Benefit Plan
Determination Date shall be eligible to be a participant in the BB&T 401(k) plan
upon  complying  with  eligibility  requirements.  All rights to  participate in
BB&T's  401(k) plan are subject to BB&T's right to amend or terminate  the plan.
Until such Benefit Plan  Determination  Date,  BB&T shall continue in effect for
the benefit of  participating  employees  the 401(k) plan of  FirstSpartan.  For
purposes of administering  BB&T's



                                       36
<PAGE>


401(k) plan,  service with FirstSpartan and the FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be service with BB&T for participation  and vesting  purposes,  but
not for  purposes  of  benefit  accrual.  Each  employee  of  FirstSpartan  or a
FirstSpartan   Subsidiary  at  the  Effective   Time  who  becomes  an  employee
immediately  following the Effective  Time of an Employer  Entity is referred to
herein as a "Transferred Employee."

         (b) Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in group
hospitalization,  medical,  dental,  life,  disability and other welfare benefit
plans and programs available to employees of the Employer Entity, subject to the
terms of such plans and programs,  as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date for
each such plan or program,  conditional  upon the Transferred  Employee's  being
employed by an Employer  Entity as of such Benefit Plan  Determination  Date and
subject to complying with  eligibility  requirements of the respective plans and
programs.  With respect to health care coverages,  participation in BB&T's plans
may be subject to availability of HMO options. In any case in which HMO coverage
is not  available,  substitute  coverage  will be provided that may not be fully
comparable  to the HMO  coverage.  With  respect to any welfare  benefit plan or
program  of  FirstSpartan  that  the  Employer  Entity  determines,  in its sole
discretion,  provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding plan
or program maintained by the Employer Entity, the Employer Entity shall continue
such  FirstSpartan  plan or program in effect for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees so long as they remain  eligible to  participate  and until they shall
become  eligible to become  participants  in the  corresponding  plan or program
maintained  by the  Employer  Entity  (and,  with  respect  to any such  plan or
program,  subject to complying with eligibility  requirements and subject to the
right of the Employer Entity to terminate such plan or program). For purposes of
administering  the welfare plans and programs  subject to this Section  5.12(b),
(A) service  with  FirstSpartan  shall be deemed to be service with the Employer
Entity for the purpose of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (if
applicable)  in such  welfare  plans and  programs,  but not for the  purpose of
computing  benefits,  if any,  determined in whole or in part with  reference to
service  (except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  5.12(c)),  and (B)  each
Transferred  Employee shall receive credit for any deductibles and out-of pocket
expenses paid prior to the applicable  Benefit Plan  Determination  Date (to the
same extent such credit was given under the analogous plan prior to such Benefit
Plan   Determination   Date)  in  satisfying  any   applicable   deductibles  or
out-of-pocket expenses.

         (c) Except to the  extent of  commitments  herein or other  contractual
commitments,  if any,  specifically made or assumed  hereunder by BB&T,  neither
BB&T nor any Employer  Entity shall have any obligation  arising from the Merger
to continue any Transferred Employees in its employ or in any specific job or to
provide to any  Transferred  Employee any specified level of compensation or any
incentive payments,  benefits or perquisites.  Each Transferred  Employee who is
terminated by an Employer Entity subsequent to the Effective Time, excluding any
employee who has a then  existing  contract  providing for severance or who is a
participant in the FirstSpartan  Severance  Compensation Plan, shall be entitled
to severance pay in accordance with the general  severance policy  maintained by
BB&T, if and to the extent that such employee is entitled


                                       37
<PAGE>


to severance pay under such policy. Such employee's service with FirstSpartan or
a FirstSpartan  Subsidiary shall be treated as service with BB&T for purposes of
determining the amount of severance pay, if any, under BB&T's severance policy.

         (d)  BB&T  agrees  to  honor  all  employment   agreements,   severance
agreements  and  deferred  compensation  agreements  that  FirstSpartan  and the
FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries  have with their  current  and former  employees  and
directors  and which have been  Disclosed  to BB&T  pursuant to this  Agreement,
except to the extent any such  agreements  shall be  superseded or terminated at
the Closing or following the Closing Date.  Except for the agreements  described
in the preceding sentence and except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.12,
the employee  benefit plans of  FirstSpartan  shall,  in the sole  discretion of
BB&T, be frozen,  terminated or merged into comparable plans of BB&T,  effective
as BB&T shall determine in its sole discretion.

         (e)  Notwithstanding  and without  limiting the  generality  of Section
5.12(d),  as soon as  practicable  following  the date hereof but, in any event,
prior  to the  Effective  Time,  FirstSpartan  shall  take  any and  all  action
necessary  to  terminate  the  ESOP  as of the  Effective  Time,  to  repay  any
outstanding  indebtedness  thereof and to allocate shares of FirstSpartan Common
Stock held  thereby to the  participants  therein in  accordance  with the terms
thereof.  No  purchases  of shares of  FirstSpartan  Common  Stock shall be made
thereunder after the date hereof.

5.13     Directors and Officers Protection
         ---------------------------------

         BB&T or a BB&T Subsidiary  shall provide and keep in force for a period
of three years after the  Effective  Time  directors'  and  officers'  liability
insurance  providing coverage to directors and officers of FirstSpartan for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance shall provide
at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in FirstSpartan's  policy on
the date  hereof;  provided,  that in no event shall the annual  premium on such
policy exceed 150% of the annual premium  payments on  FirstSpartan's  policy in
effect  as of the date  hereof  (the  "Maximum  Amount").  If the  amount of the
premiums  necessary to maintain or procure such insurance  coverage  exceeds the
Maximum  Amount,  BB&T shall use its  reasonable  efforts to  maintain  the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable
for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  BB&T
further  agrees to  indemnify  all  individuals  who are or have been  officers,
directors or employees of FirstSpartan or any  FirstSpartan  Subsidiary prior to
the Effective  Time from any acts or omissions in such  capacities  prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent that such  indemnification is provided pursuant to
the  Certificate of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of FirstSpartan on the date hereof
and is  permitted  under  the  DGCL  and the  NCBCA.  BB&T  shall  also  advance
indemnifiable expenses as incurred to the extent permitted by the Certificate of
Incorporation  or Bylaws of  FirstSpartan on the date hereof and permitted under
the DGCL and the NCBCA.

5.14     Forbearances of BB&T
         --------------------


                                       38
<PAGE>


         Except with the prior written consent of FirstSpartan, between the date
hereof and the Effective  Time neither BB&T nor any BB&T  Subsidiary  shall take
any  action  which  would  or  might  be  expected  to (i)  cause  the  business
combination contemplated hereby not to constitute a reorganization under Section
368 of the Code; (ii) result in any inaccuracy of a  representation  or warranty
herein that would allow for  termination of this  Agreement;  (iii) cause any of
the conditions  precedent to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement to
fail to be  satisfied;  or (iv) fail to comply in any material  respect with any
laws,  regulations,  ordinances or governmental  actions applicable to it and to
the conduct of its business.

5.15     Reports
         -------

         Each  of  FirstSpartan  and  BB&T  shall  file  (and  shall  cause  the
FirstSpartan  Subsidiaries and the BB&T  Subsidiaries,  respectively,  to file),
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports  required
to be filed by it with  the  Commission  and any  other  regulatory  authorities
having  jurisdiction over such party, and shall deliver to BB&T or FirstSpartan,
as the case may be,  copies  of all such  reports  promptly  after  the same are
filed. If financial  statements are contained in any such reports filed with the
Commission,  such  financial  statements  will fairly  present the  consolidated
financial  position  of the  entity  filing  such  statements  as of  the  dates
indicated and the consolidated  results of operations,  changes in shareholders'
equity,  and cash  flows for the  periods  then  ended in  accordance  with GAAP
(subject in the case of interim financial statements to the absence of notes and
to normal recurring  year-end  adjustments  that are not material).  As of their
respective  dates,  such reports  filed with the  Commission  will comply in all
material  respects  with the  Securities  Laws and will not  contain  any untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the  circumstances  under which they were made,  not  misleading.  Any financial
statements  contained in any other reports to a regulatory  authority other than

have, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstSpartan (evaluated without regard to the
Merger).

         (b)  No  regulatory  approval  shall  have  imposed  any  condition  or
requirement  which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors of BB&T,

such transactions inadvisable or unduly burdensome.

obligations and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by
this Agreement.

         (d) FirstSpartan shall have delivered to BB&T a certificate,  dated the

         (a) At any time prior to the Effective  Time, by the mutual  consent in
writing of the parties hereto.

         (b) At any time prior to the Effective  Time, by either party hereto in
writing (i) in the event of a material breach by the other party of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement,  or (ii) in the event of an inaccuracy
of any  representation  or  warranty  of  the  other  party  contained  in  this
Agreement,  which inaccuracy would provide the nonbreaching party the ability to
refuse to  consummate  the Merger  under the  applicable  standard  set forth in
Section  6.2(a) in the case of  FirstSpartan  and Section  6.3(a) in the case of
BB&T; and, in the case of (i) or (ii), if such breach or inaccuracy has not been
cured by the earlier of thirty days  following  written notice of such breach to
the party committing such breach or the Effective Time.

         (c) At any time prior to the Effective  Time, by either party hereto in
writing,  if any of the  conditions  precedent to the  obligations  of the other
party to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled  prior to the Closing Date,  and the party giving the notice is not in
material  breach  of  any  of  its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or
undertakings herein.

         (d) At any time,  by either  party  hereto  in  writing,  if any of the
applications for prior approval  referred to in Section 5.4 are denied,  and the
time period for appeals and requests for reconsideration has run.

         (e) At any time, by either party hereto in writing, if the shareholders
of FirstSpartan do not approve the Agreement and the Plan of Merger at a meeting
called and held for the purpose of voting thereon.

<PAGE>


         (f) At any time  following  April 30,  2001 by either  party  hereto in
writing, if the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of business on such
date,  and the party  giving the notice is not in material  breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings herein.

         (g) At any time prior to the Effective Time, by BB&T in writing, if the
Board of Directors of FirstSpartan shall have withdrawn,  modified,  conditioned

7.2      Effect of Termination
         ---------------------

         In the  event  this  Agreement  and the Plan of  Merger  is  terminated

void and have no effect,  except  that (i) the  provisions  hereof  relating  to
confidentiality  and expenses  set forth in Sections 5.7 and 8.1,  respectively,
shall survive any such  termination  and (ii) a termination  pursuant to Section
7.1(b) shall not relieve the breaching  party from liability for a breach of the
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty giving rise to such termination.
The BB&T Option  Agreement shall be governed by its own terms,  and no provision
contained  herein  shall limit the ability of BB&T to exercise  its rights under

expire on, and be terminated and extinguished at, the Effective Time, other than
covenants  that by their  terms are to be  performed  after the  Effective  Time
(including  Sections  5.13 and  5.17);  provided  that no such  representations,
warranties or covenants  shall be deemed to be terminated or  extinguished so as
to deprive BB&T or FirstSpartan (or any director,  officer or controlling person
thereof) of any defense at law or in equity which  otherwise  would be available
against the claims of any person, including, without limitation, any shareholder
or  former   shareholder   of  either  BB&T  or   FirstSpartan,   the  aforesaid
representations,   warranties  and  covenants  being  material   inducements  to
consummation by BB&T and FirstSpartan of the transactions contemplated herein.

at any time (whether  before or after  approval of the Agreement and the Plan of
Merger by the FirstSpartan  shareholders) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto and may waive (i)
any  inaccuracies  of the  other  party  in the  representations  or  warranties
contained  in this  Agreement,  the Plan of  Merger  or any  document  delivered
pursuant  hereto  or  thereto,  (ii)  compliance  with  any  of  the  covenants,


                                       44
<PAGE>


undertakings  or agreements of the other party,  or  satisfaction  of any of the
conditions  precedent  to its  obligations,  contained  herein or in the Plan of
Merger,  or (iii) the  performance by the other party of any of its  obligations
set out  herein or  therein;  provided  that no such  extension  or  waiver,  or
amendment or supplement pursuant to this Section 7.4, executed after approval by
the  FirstSpartan  shareholders of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger,  shall
reduce either the Exchange Ratio or the payment terms for fractional interests.

7.5      Amendment or Supplement

this Agreement and the BB&T Option  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the parties hereto and thereto and their respective  successors.
Nothing in this Agreement or the BB&T Option Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party,  other than the parties  hereto and  thereto,
