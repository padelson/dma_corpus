                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT") is made this 31st day
of October, 2005, by and between M & F Worldwide Corp., a Delaware corporation
("PURCHASER"), and Honeywell International Inc., a Delaware corporation
("HONEYWELL" or the "SELLER").

         WHEREAS, Honeywell owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock (the "SHARES") of Novar USA Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NOVAR
USA" or the "COMPANY");

         WHEREAS, Novar USA, together with its divisions and Subsidiaries, own
or hold the assets, rights, obligations and liabilities comprising the SPS
Business; and

         WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser desires to acquire from the Seller the Shares, and the
Seller desires to sell to Purchaser the Shares.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and
agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

         1.1      PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined below), Honeywell shall
sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser the Shares free and
clear of all Encumbrances, and Purchaser shall deliver to Honeywell the Purchase
Price.

         1.2      PURCHASE PRICE. The aggregate purchase price (the "PURCHASE
PRICE") to be paid for the Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement shall be Eight Hundred Million Dollars ($800,000,000) in cash, subject
to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver
the Purchase Price to Honeywell by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to the wire transfer instructions that will be provided by Honeywell
not later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.

                                   ARTICLE II
                           CLOSING; CLOSING DELIVERIES

         2.1      CLOSING DATE. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at
the New York offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, 1285
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, five (5) business days following
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature have to be satisfied at
Closing (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)), or at
such other place and time as the parties may agree; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing, at Purchaser's election, shall


<PAGE>

not occur prior to a date that is sixty (60) days from the date that the Recent
Financial Statements are delivered to Purchaser. The date on which the Closing
will occur is referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE." Assuming that the
Closing occurs in accordance with the preceding sentence, the transfer of the
Shares pursuant to Section 1.1 shall be deemed to have become effective at 12:01
a.m., in each relevant time zone where assets of the Company are located on the
Closing Date (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

         2.2      CLOSING DELIVERIES. At the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall
deliver to Honeywell (i) evidence of the wire transfers referred to in Section
1.2 and (ii) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c)
and (b) Honeywell shall deliver to Purchaser (i) stock certificates for the
Shares, which certificates shall be duly endorsed to Purchaser or accompanied by
duly executed stock powers, (ii) written resignations, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, of those officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are employees of Honeywell or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company) and
such other directors identified by Purchaser not later than three (3) days prior
to Closing, and (iii) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2(c).

         2.3      WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a)      Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
and the Company shall prepare and deliver to Honeywell (i) a statement (the
"PRELIMINARY WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT") setting forth a calculation of the Net
Working Capital (the "PRELIMINARY NET WORKING CAPITAL") and (ii) a calculation
of the amount Purchaser asserts is due and owing in accordance with Section
2.3(e). The "FINAL NET WORKING CAPITAL" shall be the Preliminary Net Working
Capital shown on the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, as modified pursuant
to this Section 2.3.

                  (b)      Unless Honeywell notifies Purchaser in writing that
Honeywell disagrees with any items included in the Preliminary Working Capital
Statement (such notice to include Honeywell's objections and reasonably detailed
proposed revisions to said documents and in reasonable detail the basis therefor
along with any relevant supporting data), within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof, the Preliminary Working Capital Statement shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties and shall be the Final Net Working Capital, it being
understood that Honeywell shall not thereafter be entitled to alter the scope or
amount of any such disputed items (it being understood that this sentence shall
not preclude any later agreement of Honeywell and Purchaser with respect to any
item relating to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement or the Final Net
Working Capital). Any items which are not disputed in writing by Honeywell
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed agreed in all respects by
Honeywell and shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. If Honeywell so
notifies Purchaser in writing within such thirty (30) day period, then Honeywell
and Purchaser shall attempt to resolve their differences with respect thereto
within fifteen (15) days after Purchaser's receipt of Honeywell's written notice
of disagreement. If Honeywell and Purchaser resolve their differences with
respect to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement within such fifteen (15)
day period, then the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, with such
modifications necessary to reflect such agreement

                                       2
<PAGE>

of Honeywell and Purchaser, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and
shall be the Final Net Working Capital. Any disputes not resolved by Honeywell
and Purchaser within such fifteen (15) day period regarding the Preliminary
Working Capital Statement will be resolved by an Independent Accounting Firm
jointly retained by Honeywell and Purchaser. Honeywell and Purchaser shall seek
to retain the Independent Accounting Firm not later than the last day of such
fifteen (15) day period. The Independent Accounting Firm shall make a
determination on the disputes so submitted as well as such modifications, if
any, to the Preliminary Working Capital Statement and the Final Net Working
Capital to reflect such determination, and the same shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
for any item in dispute cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the
greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that particular item in the
Preliminary Working Capital Statement, in the case of Purchaser, or in the
notice described in the first sentence of this paragraph, in the case of
Honeywell. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
shared equally by Honeywell and Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
be instructed to render its decision in accordance with the terms hereof,
including the Specified Accounting Policies.

                  (c)      In connection with Honeywell's review of the
Preliminary Working Capital Statement, Honeywell and its representatives shall
have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared
by Purchaser or the Company or their respective representatives, subject to
customary indemnification, confidentiality and other agreements that may be
requested by such representatives, and to the books and records, the financial
systems and finance personnel and any other information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that Honeywell reasonably requests, and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, to cooperate
reasonably with Honeywell and its representatives in connection therewith.

                  (d)      Not later than thirty (30) days after the engagement
of the Independent Accounting Firm (as evidenced by its written acceptance by
facsimile or otherwise to the parties), the parties shall submit simultaneous
briefs to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy to the other parties)
setting forth their respective positions regarding the issues in dispute, and
not later than thirty (30) days after the submission of such briefs the parties
shall submit simultaneous reply briefs (with a copy to the other parties). The
Independent Accounting Firm shall render its decision resolving the dispute
within thirty (30) days after submission of the reply briefs. If additional
briefing, a hearing, or other information is required by the Independent
Accounting Firm, the Independent Accounting Firm shall give notice thereof to
the parties as soon as practicable before the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, and the parties shall promptly respond with a view to minimizing any
delay in the decision date.

                  (e)      In the event that the Final Net Working Capital is
greater than Nineteen Million Dollars ($19,000,000), Purchaser shall pay to
Honeywell the amount of such excess, together with interest thereon from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate equal to the U.S. dollar prime
rate, as announced by The Bank of New

                                       3
<PAGE>

York as of the Closing Date (the "PRIME RATE"), by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, not later than five (5) business days after the Final Net
Working Capital has been agreed to or deemed to be agreed to by, or has been
delivered by the Independent Accounting Firm to, Purchaser and Honeywell
pursuant to this Section 2.3. In the event that the Final Net Working Capital is
less than Nineteen Million Dollars ($19,000,000), Honeywell shall pay to
Purchaser the amount of such deficit (such deficit to include the amount of any
negative Final Net Working Capital), together with interest thereon from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate equal to the Prime Rate, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, not later than five (5) business days
after the Final Net Working Capital has been agreed to or deemed to be agreed to
by, or has been delivered by the Independent Accounting Firm to, Purchaser and
Honeywell pursuant to this Section 2.3.

                  (f)      For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the parties agree that any matter specifically resolved
and reflected as part of Final Net Working Capital under this Section 2.3 shall
not also be recoverable as a Tax Loss pursuant to Article VII or a Loss pursuant
to Article IX to the extent that the amount of such Loss or Tax Loss, as
applicable, is reflected as a current liability in Final Net Working Capital.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the adjustments contemplated
by this Section 2.3 shall not be used to challenge the Specified Accounting
Policies used to calculate the Net Working Capital.

                                   ARTICLE III
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HONEYWELL

         Honeywell hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser on the date
hereof and at Closing (except to the extent such representations and warranties
are expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case such representations and
warranties are made as of such earlier date), that, except as set forth on the
disclosure schedule delivered by Honeywell to Purchaser concurrently herewith
(the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (it being understood that any matter set forth in
the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any section of
this Article III to which the matter relates, so long as the description of such
matter in the Disclosure Schedule plainly and clearly indicates its relevance to
the pertinent section):

         3.1      CORPORATE STATUS. The Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and each (a) has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and (b) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation or leasing of its
properties and assets and the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, licensed or authorized, except where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or authorized would not have an SPS Material Adverse Effect. Honeywell
has Made Available to Purchaser (A) a copy of the certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, regulations or other organizational or governing documents of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company, each as in effect on the date
hereof, and (B) copies of the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders, the
boards of directors and each committee

                                       4
<PAGE>

of the boards of directors of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company
held since January 1, 2003 until the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company is or, to the knowledge of Honeywell since January 1,

material benefit under), or result in the creation of any Encumbrance (not
including Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of the properties or assets of the

validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and owned with good and valid title
by such record owner, and free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, except
Encumbrances incurred in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company and the shares of the Subsidiaries of the Company
set forth on Section 3.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedule constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of such Subsidiaries. None of the Shares or

otherwise) or other agreements of any character to which any of Honeywell, the
Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company is a party, or is otherwise subject,
requiring, and there are no securities of the Company or the Subsidiaries of the
Company outstanding which upon conversion or exchange would require, the
issuance, sale or transfer of any additional shares of capital stock or other
securities of the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase capital
stock or any other securities of the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company.
There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit
participation, or similar rights with respect to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, any of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any authorized or outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing
the right to subscribe for or acquire securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company or any such Subsidiary on any matter. None of
Honeywell, the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company is a party, or is
otherwise subject, to any voting trust or other voting agreement or any
agreement restricting transfer of the Shares with respect to any of the shares
of capital stock of the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company or to any
agreement relating to the issuance, sale, repurchase, redemption, transfer,
acquisition or other disposition or the registration of the capital stock of the
Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company.

                  (c)      Other than the Subsidiaries of the Company listed in
Section 3.4(a) to the Disclosure Schedule, there are no joint ventures or other
Persons in which the Company or its Subsidiaries own, of record or beneficially,
any direct or indirect equity or other similar interest or any right (contingent
or otherwise) to acquire the same. All of the Subsidiaries of the Company are,
either directly or indirectly, wholly owned by the Company.

                  (b)      Since the Reference Date, there has not been an SPS
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Except as and to the extent reflected on, or
adequately reserved for on, the SPS Balance Sheet (the adequacy of such reserve
to be determined as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) and Liabilities
incurred since the date of the SPS Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not
have any material Liabilities (excluding Liabilities of the type covered by the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.8, 3.9,

                                       9
<PAGE>

3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13(b)). None of the Company, Novar Investments (USA)
Inc., Novar Finance Inc. and Novar Holdco Inc. (nor any of their Subsidiaries
other than Security Printing, Inc. and its Subsidiaries) has (A) any Liabilities
other than (i) Liabilities that will either be terminated or cancelled at or
prior to the Closing or fully reflected as current liabilities in Final Net
Working Capital under this Agreement, (ii) Liabilities reflected in the
Financial Statements or (iii) Liabilities which are incurred by any such entity
solely as a result of its direct or indirect ownership of all of the outstanding
securities of the SPI Group (but only to the extent that such Liabilities are no
greater than the related Liabilities of the SPI Group) (the Liabilities referred
to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any of the Liabilities listed in Section 3.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule,
other than the Liabilities under the sublease listed in item 7 thereof and, to
the extent provided in Section 5.11(d), the Contract listed in item 8 thereof)
being referred to herein as the "PERMITTED HOLDING COMPANY LIABILITIES") or (B)
any past or current assets or operations with respect to which such entities may
have continuing exposure to liability which is not reflected in the Financial
Statements. Except as set forth in the Financial Statements, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any "off-balance sheet arrangement" within
the meaning of Item 303 of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"). Based on prior experience, it is Honeywell's good faith
belief that the maximum exposure (without giving effect to any indemnities under
this Agreement) to the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Novar Guarantees
will not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount set forth on Section 3.6(c)(iii)
of the Disclosure Schedule.

         3.7      TAXES.

                  (a)      Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly
and timely filed (or there has been filed on its behalf) all material Tax
Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable
extensions) with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and (ii) paid all Taxes owed
by such companies (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Return). All such Tax
Returns (including information provided therewith or with respect thereto) are
true and correct in all material respects. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of September 30, 2005, exceed the reserve for
Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the SPS
Balance Sheet, and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage
of time through the Closing Date.

                  (b)      For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2001,
Honeywell, the Company or its Subsidiaries have Made Available to Purchaser
true, correct and complete copies, or pro forma or redacted copies, of all
material Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, examination reports and statements of deficiencies including the
Company or its Subsidiaries for taxable periods, or transactions consummated,
for which the applicable statutory period of limitations have not expired.

                  (c)      There are no material Encumbrances for Taxes upon any
property or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"PURCHASED

                                       10
<PAGE>

ENTITIES"), except for Encumbrances for Taxes that are not due and payable, are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or may thereafter be
paid without penalty and with respect to which appropriate reserves (if required
by GAAP, determined as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) are being held
by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

                 (d)       There is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund
litigations or proposed adjustment with respect to any amount of Taxes pending
or in progress or threatened with respect to any Taxes of the Purchased
Entities. As of the date hereof, none of the Purchased Entities has received
notice in writing of any claim made by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction
where the Purchased Entity does not file a Tax Return, that the Purchased Entity
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, where such claim has not
been resolved favorably to the Purchased Entity. All deficiencies for Taxes
asserted or assessed against the Purchased Entities have been fully and timely
paid, settled, disputed or properly reflected in the Financial Statements.

                  (e)      There are no outstanding written requests,
agreements, consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations
applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or assessment or
reassessment of any Taxes or Tax deficiencies against any of the Purchased
Entities.

                  (f)      Each of the Purchased Entities has each withheld (or
will withhold) from their respective employees, independent contractors,
creditors, stockholders and third parties and timely paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority proper and accurate amounts in all respects for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date in compliance with all applicable
information reporting and Tax withholding and remitting requirements under U.S.
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. Tax laws.

                  (g)      None of the Purchased Entities is a party to, is
bound by or has any obligation under any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax
indemnity agreement or similar contract or arrangement (collectively, "TAX
SHARING AGREEMENTS") or has any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than
members of the Affiliated Group filing consolidated federal income tax returns
of which the Company is the common parent) under Treas. Reg. 1.1502-6, Treas.
Reg. 1.1502-78 or similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

                  (h)      None of the Purchased Entities has engaged in a
transaction that the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") has identified by
regulation or other form of published guidance as a listed transaction, as set
forth in Treas. Reg. 1.6011-4(b)(2).

                  (i)      None of the Purchased Entities has taken any
reporting position on a Tax Return, which reporting position (i) if not
sustained would be more likely than not, absent disclosure, to give rise to a
penalty for substantial understatement of federal income Tax under Section 6662
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law), and
(ii) has not adequately been disclosed on such Tax Return

                                       11
<PAGE>

in accordance with Section 6662(d)(2)(B) of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local, or foreign Tax law).

                  (j)      None of the Purchased Entities has constituted a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of
Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of shares qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with this acquisition.

                  (k)      None of the Purchased Entities has agreed, or is
required to make, any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code, and no
Governmental Authority has proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting
method.

                  (l)      Any adjustment of Taxes of the Purchased Entities
made by the IRS, which adjustment is required to be reported to the appropriate
state, local, or foreign Governmental Authorities, has been so reported.

                  (m)      None of the Purchased Entities has executed or
entered into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, and none of the Purchased
Entities is subject to any private letter ruling of the IRS or comparable ruling
of any other Governmental Authority.

                  (n)      No power of attorney has been granted by the Seller
or the Purchased Entities related to Taxes of the Purchased Entities, which
power of attorney is currently in force.

                  (o)      No property owned by any of the Purchased Entities
(i) is property required to be treated as being owned by another Person pursuant
to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
amended and in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act
of 1986, (ii) constitutes "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of
Section 168(h)(1) of the Code or (iii) is "tax-exempt bond financed property"
within the meaning of Section 168(g)(5) of the Code.

                  (p)      None of the Purchased Entities is a direct or
indirect beneficiary of a guarantee of Tax benefits or any other arrangement
that has the same economic effect (including an indemnity from a seller or
lessee of property, or other insurance) with respect to any transaction or Tax
opinion relating to the Purchased Entities.

                  (q)      None of the Purchased Entities owes any "corporate
acquisition indebtedness" within the meaning of Section 279 of the Code.

been filed, and the issuance, registration or application numbers and dates with
respect to such item.

                  (b)      The Company and its Subsidiaries own, free and clear
of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), or have rights to use

its personnel or third parties in a manner violative of Law or the applicable
Privacy Policy and, to the knowledge of Honeywell, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to or made any unauthorized use of any Customer Information.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have adopted written information
security programs designed to protect all Customer Information, copies of which
have been Made Available to Purchaser.

                  (n)      The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in the granting by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries of any rights
or licenses to any Intellectual Property of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to any third party (including any
covenant not to sue with respect to any Intellectual Property of Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries).

suits, investigations or proceedings pending against or, to the knowledge of
Honeywell, threatened against, the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company or

to the knowledge of Honeywell, there are no such Governmental Orders threatened
to be imposed. There are no (a) formal governmental inquiries or investigations
pending with respect to which Honeywell or any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice or would generally be expected to receive notice, or to the knowledge of
Honeywell, otherwise pending or threatened relating to, affecting or involving
the SPS Business or (b) to the knowledge of Honeywell, informal governmental
inquiries or investigations, internal investigations or whistle-blower
complaints pending or threatened, relating to, affecting or involving the SPS
Business, except, in the case of clause (b) above, for those that are not
reasonably expected to give rise to material Liability or interfere, in any
material respect, with the conduct of the SPS Business. This representation and
warranty does not apply to environmental matters, which are the subject of
Section 3.11.

         3.10     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS.

material Permits that are necessary to the conduct of their respective
businesses as presently being conducted. All Permits are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not

material Liability or interfere, in any material respect, with the conduct of
the SPS Business. To the knowledge of Honeywell, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is in violation or default (other than immaterial violations or
defaults) of any Permits, other than any such violations or defaults which would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to give rise to
material Liability or interfere, in any material respect, with the conduct of
the SPS Business. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has received any
written notification from any Governmental Authority threatening to revoke any
Permit other than revocations which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to give rise to material Liability or
interfere, in any material respect, with the conduct of the SPS Business.

                  (c)      The Company and its Subsidiaries are and, within the
last two (2) years have been, in compliance in all material respects with all

compliance with applicable Environmental Laws in all material respects.

                  (b)      There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the

other location, for which the Company or its Subsidiaries have or will have a
material obligation to undertake any investigation, cleanup or remedial action
pursuant to any Environmental Laws. Except as permitted or allowed pursuant to
any Environmental Law, there are no Materials of Environmental Concern present
on, in, under or migrating from any Property, and no disposal, generation,
release, discharge, spill or treatment of Materials of Environmental Concern has

in a material default or violation of any Material Contract. Each of the
Material Contracts is in full force and effect, and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge
of Honeywell, of the other parties thereto. The

                                       21

Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all respective material obligations
required to be performed by them to date under the Material Contracts. Honeywell
has Made Available to Purchaser true and complete copies of each Material
Contract.

                  (c)      The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
controls, measures and safeguards in place to provide commercially reasonable
assurance as to the accuracy and timeliness of transactions (including cash,
check, credit card and electronic funds transactions) between (A) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, on the one hand, and (B) any account
holder of any party (or an Affiliate of any such Person) to a Partner Contract
or Direct Contract, on the other hand, whose financial account the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, may be authorized to debit or credit
under such Partner Contract or Direct Contract or otherwise. For the avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing sentence is not intended to be a representation and
warranty with respect to compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been (during the last twelve (12) months
as of the date hereof), is or, to the knowledge of Honeywell, is expected to be
(in each instance, as of the date hereof and based on notice received from the
other party to such Contract) the subject of an audit, review or investigation
by a party to a Partner Contract or Direct Contract in respect of the
transactions contemplated by such Contracts, other than audits, reviews or
investigations undertaken in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice that have not revealed any material defaults or violations.

Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of (a) the top 25
customers of the SPS Business (by revenue) during each of the last two (2)
fiscal years and for the first nine (9) months of the current fiscal year (the

approximate amount of revenue attributable to such Key Customer during such
period, and (b) the top 25 suppliers of the SPS Business during each of the last
two fiscal years and for the first nine (9) months of the current fiscal year
(the "KEY SUPPLIERS") and sets forth opposite the name of such Key Supplier the

Since the Reference Date and prior to the date hereof, no Key Customer or Key
Supplier (based on the revenues for the first nine (9) months of the current
fiscal year) has cancelled or otherwise terminated its relationship with the SPS
Business, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Key Customer or Key Supplier (based on the revenues for
the first nine (9) months of the current fiscal year) to the effect that any
such Key Customer or Key Supplier intends to terminate or adversely modify in
any material respect its relationship with the SPS Business.

the "LEASED REAL PROPERTY" and, collectively with the Owned Real Property, the
"PROPERTY"), which schedule sets forth the date of and the parties to each Real
Property Lease, and the address of the Leased Real Property covered thereby.
Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, as tenant, are in monetary default
beyond any applicable notice and cure periods with respect to the Real Property
Leases with annual base rents of at least $100,000.

                  (c)      Section 3.15(c) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a

holds, nor is it obligated under or a party to, any option, right of first
refusal or other contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell or dispose of the
Property or any portion thereof or interest therein.

                  (e)      The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and

repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and sufficient to operate the SPS
Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.

                  (f)      The Company and its Subsidiaries own, lease, sublease
or license all Property and Tangible Property that are used in the ordinary
course of their business and operations.

and other material improvements included within the Owned Real Property and to
the knowledge of Honeywell included within the Leased Real Property that is
actually and physically occupied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"IMPROVEMENTS"), including the roofs and structural elements thereof and the
heating, ventilation, air conditioning, systems and facilities included therein,
are in operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and
sufficient to operate the SPS Business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice.

as of the Closing Date, good and marketable fee title to the Owned Real Property
and a valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property, as provided in the
applicable Lease, in each case, free and clear of any liens, defects,
exceptions, rights of way, restrictions, covenants, claims, similar matters, or
other encumbrance in respect of such property or asset (collectively,
"ENCUMBRANCES"), except for Permitted Encumbrances.

                  (i)      Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice (and with respect to the Leased Real Property, written
notice from the respective landlord) of any pending, threatened or contemplated
condemnation proceeding affecting the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real
Property that is actually and physically occupied by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any part thereof or of any sale or other disposition of such
Leased Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation.

                  (j)      Since January 1, 2003, no material portion of the
Owned Real Property has suffered during the period of ownership, occupancy or
use of such Owned Real Property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
material damage by fire or other casualty which has not heretofore been
completely repaired or restored.

         3.16     SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS. The assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries constitute all of the material assets held by Honeywell and its
Affiliates for use in the SPS Business and are sufficient for the continued
conduct of the SPS Business in substantially the same manner as currently
conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, have good title
to or a valid leasehold or similar interest in all tangible assets (other than
Permitted Encumbrances). The tangible leased assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in operating condition and repair (normal wear and tear
excepted) and sufficient to operate the SPS Business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

<PAGE>

Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice with respect to employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries located in the United States, nor is there
pending or, to the knowledge of Honeywell, threatened, nor has there been since
December 31, 2003, any organized effort or demand for recognition or
certification or attempt to organize employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any labor organization. There is no pending nor, to the
knowledge of Honeywell, threatened labor strike, walk-out, work stoppage,
slowdown or lockout with respect to employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no labor strike, walk-out, work stoppage, slowdown or lockout
has occurred during the two (2) years preceding the date hereof.

carrier regarding any refusal of coverage under, or any rejection of any claim
under, any such policies and, to the knowledge of Honeywell, there is no basis
for any such refusal of coverage or rejection of any such claim.

any stockholder or board approvals) required to be taken by Purchaser to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the

         5.2      FILINGS WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

                  (a)      Honeywell and Purchaser shall as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date
hereof, cause to be filed with the FTC and the DOJ the notification and report
form pursuant to the HSR Act required for the transactions contemplated hereby.
Honeywell and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, comply with any
request for additional information and documents pursuant to the HSR Act.
Honeywell and Purchaser shall inform the other promptly of any communication
made by or on behalf of such party to (including

                                       32
<PAGE>

permitting the other party to review such communication in advance), or received
from, the FTC or the DOJ and shall furnish to the other such information and
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is necessary or
advisable under the HSR Act. Honeywell and Purchaser shall keep each other
timely apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ, and shall comply
promptly with any such inquiry or request. Neither party shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiries unless it consults with the other
party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

                  (b)      Purchaser shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
use its best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust or competition Law that may be asserted by any U.S. federal, state,
local or foreign antitrust or competition Governmental Authority so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of
its assets or businesses, or of the business to be acquired by it pursuant to
this Agreement, as is required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise
have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing regarding Governmental Authorities, Purchaser agrees to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to attempt to vacate or lift any order or
other restraint relating to antitrust matters that would have the effect of
making the transaction contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise
prohibiting its consummation. Honeywell shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with
Purchaser's obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2(b).

                  (c)      The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another
in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority (excluding the actions and filings described in Section
5.2(a)) is required or reasonably appropriate, or any action, consent, approval
or waiver from any party to any material Contract is required or reasonably
appropriate, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such actions or making
any such filings, the parties hereto shall furnish information required in
connection therewith and timely seek to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

         5.3      CONSENTS. Except as contemplated in Section 5.2, Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Honeywell, on the other hand, shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all consents (including all consents identified in good
faith by any of the parties as required under any Contract) and authorizations
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including obtaining

                                       33
<PAGE>

the consents and authorizations and making the filings referred to in Sections
3.3 and 4.3; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor
Honeywell, on the other hand, will be obligated to make any material payment to
any Person from whom consent or authorization is requested.

         5.4      CONFIDENTIALITY; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a)      Purchaser acknowledges that the information being
Made Available to it by Honeywell or its Subsidiaries (or their respective
agents or representatives) is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement, dated June 2, 2005, between MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. and
Honeywell (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference, and Purchaser hereby agrees to be bound by all of the
obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. under the Confidentiality
Agreement as if Purchaser were an original party to the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser hereby acknowledges
its confidentiality obligations in the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate
only with respect to information relating to the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and
all other information provided or Made Available to it by Honeywell or its
Subsidiaries (or their respective agents or representatives) concerning
Honeywell or their its Subsidiaries will remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

                  (b)      Honeywell shall, subject to compliance with
applicable Laws, provide Purchaser access and the opportunity to make such
investigation of the management, employees, properties, businesses and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and such examination of the
books, records and financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
it reasonably requests (excluding any subsurface or other intrusive
investigation of real or personal property). Any confidential information
provided pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall, subject to Section 5.4(a), be
kept confidential by Purchaser and will be subject to applicable Law and the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any such investigation and examination
will be conducted under reasonable circumstances after appropriate advance
notice and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the SPS Business. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect any
representation or warranty by Honeywell in this Agreement or any condition to
the obligations (or indemnification or other rights) of Purchaser hereunder.

         5.5      PUBLICITY. Honeywell shall not, and shall not permit the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, and Purchaser shall not, issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, in the reasonable judgment of Honeywell or Purchaser, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Honeywell or Purchaser lists its securities; PROVIDED that, to
the extent required by applicable Law or by the rules of any

                                       34
<PAGE>

stock exchange, the party intending to make such release or announcement shall
use its reasonable best efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

         5.6      BOOKS AND RECORDS.

                  (a)      Honeywell shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser at Closing all properties, books,
records, Contracts, information and documents relating to the SPS Business that
are not then in the possession or control of the Company or its Subsidiaries. As
soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, Honeywell will deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser any remaining properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating to the businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are not already in the possession or control of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Subject to Section 5.15 of this Agreement,
Honeywell shall be permitted to retain one (1) copy of materials that have been
Made Available to Purchaser solely for archival record-keeping purposes.

                  (b)      Subject to Section 7.2(a) (relating to the
preservation of Tax records), Honeywell and Purchaser agree that each of them
will preserve and keep the records held by it relating to the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing
Date in accordance with their respective corporate records retention policies;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to disposing of any such records in accordance
with such policies, the applicable party shall provide written notice to the
other party of its intent to dispose of such records and shall provide such
other party the opportunity to take ownership and possession of such records (at
such other party's sole expense) to the extent they relate to such other party's
business or obligations within 30 days after such notice is delivered. If such
other party does not confirm its intention in writing to take ownership and
possession of such records within such 30-day period, the party who possesses
the records may proceed with the disposition of such records. Honeywell and
Purchaser shall make such records available to the other as may be reasonably
required by such party in connection with, among other things, any insurance
claims by, legal proceedings against, or governmental investigations of
Honeywell or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or in order to
enable Honeywell or Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under
this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby or to the extent necessary in connection with their respective
financial reporting or tax reporting obligations relating to any period ending
on or before the Closing Date.

         5.7      FURTHER ACTION. Honeywell and Purchaser shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions (within their respective control) necessary or appropriate to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) cause the fulfillment
at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.8      EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and

                                       35
<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto incurring
such expenses except as expressly provided herein (it being understood that,
except for immaterial expenses that are fully reflected as current liabilities
in Final Net Working Capital, all such out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those incurred in connection with
Purchaser's financing hereunder, shall be paid by Honeywell at or prior to
Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Honeywell shall each pay
one-half of any fees required to be paid under the HSR Act.

         5.9      NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.

                  (a)      Each party shall give prompt notice to the other of
the following:

                           (i)      the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
         whose occurrence or nonoccurrence could reasonably be expected to cause
         any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI not to be
         satisfied; and

                           (ii)     the status of matters relating to completion
         of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing
         the other with copies of notices or other communications received by
         any party or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental Authority or
         other third party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

                  (b)      Honeywell shall use its reasonable best efforts to
keep Purchaser promptly informed of any material development related to any
Partner Contract or Direct Contract.

                  (c)      No notification pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall
affect any representation or warranty by Honeywell in this Agreement or any
condition to the obligations (or indemnification or other rights) of Purchaser
hereunder.

         5.10     EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (a)      The employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing (the "AFFECTED EMPLOYEES") shall remain employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing; PROVIDED, that nothing
in this Agreement shall limit or affect Purchaser's right to terminate the
employment of any such Affected Employee at any time following the Closing.
Honeywell and its Affiliates shall also agree to allow for the transfer of any
of the employees listed on Schedule 5.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on or prior to the Closing, at Purchaser's option,
subject to the continued recognition of any related severance obligations and
consent of any such employee. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities arising out of
or related to any Plan (including Liabilities attributable to periods prior to
Closing). The foregoing, however, shall not limit Purchaser's rights under
Article IX for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

                                       36
<PAGE>

                  (b)      For a period of not less than twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause its
Affiliates or the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide,
compensation and health and welfare and defined contribution plan benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and health and
welfare and defined contribution plan benefits provided to the Affected
Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
comply (or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply) with the
terms of all Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
any reserved right to amend or terminate any Plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such amendment or termination may be inconsistent with Purchaser's obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.10.

                  (c)      Affected Employees shall be given credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, if greater) under all employee benefit plans and
arrangements currently maintained or established in the future by Purchaser, its
Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which they are or become
participants for purposes of participation, eligibility, vesting, and level of
benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or
any plan providing post-retirement medical, dental or prescription drug benefits
or as would otherwise result in duplication of benefits). Purchaser, its
Affiliates, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical
examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Purchaser, its Affiliates, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to Affected Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent waived under the corresponding Company
Employee Benefit Plan in which the applicable Affected Employee participated
prior to the Effective Time (to the extent permitted by the applicable welfare
plans and as required by applicable Law).

                  (d)      No later than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date, Honeywell shall provide Purchaser with a list setting forth the
number of employees terminated or to be terminated from each site of employment
of the Company and of each of its Subsidiaries during the 90-day period ending
on the Closing Date for reasons qualifying the termination as "employment
losses" under the WARN Act and the date of each such termination with respect to
each termination; provided, that this sentence shall not apply with respect to
any site of employment at which sufficient employees have not been employed at
any time in such 90-day period for terminations of employment at such site to be
subject to the WARN Act.

         5.11     INDEBTEDNESS; INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS.

                  (a)      No later than the Closing Date, (x) Honeywell shall
discharge (or otherwise cause to be extinguished), or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to discharge (or otherwise cause to be extinguished) any and all
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than (i) Indebtedness
owing from one member of the SPI Group to another member of the SPI Group
(unless Purchaser shall have given written notice to Honeywell on or prior to
the earlier of (i) December 1, 2005 or (ii) ten (10) business days prior to the
Closing that any such Indebtedness be discharged or

                                       37
<PAGE>

extinguished), (ii) any letters of credit and (iii) any surety bonds) and (y)
Honeywell shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries, to terminate or
cancel or otherwise extinguish any and all intercompany accounts and Contracts
(provided that items 3, 4 and 9 set forth in Section 3.13(a)(vii) of the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be so terminated and extinguished but shall be
addressed as provided in Section 5.11(d) and Section 5.12 of this Agreement, to
the extent applicable) and other intercompany Indebtedness between any of
Honeywell or its Subsidiaries (other than the SPI Group), on the one hand, and
the SPI Group, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, and without
limiting Honeywell's obligations to indemnify for Excluded Liabilities, the
obligations to discharge or extinguish Indebtedness pursuant to this Section
5.11(a) shall not apply to the items listed in Section 3.13(a)(iv)(A), (B) or
(C) of the Disclosure Schedule but shall apply to all of the items listed in
Section 3.13(a)(iv)(D) of the Disclosure Schedule; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the following sentence, the
Indebtedness set forth in item 1 of Section 3.13(a)(iv)(D) of the Disclosure
Schedule shall not be discharged or extinguished if (x) Honeywell shall not have
elected to effect the Restructuring Transactions pursuant to Section 10.11 and
(y) Purchaser shall have given written notice to Honeywell on or prior to the
earlier of (i) December 1, 2005 or (ii) ten (10) business days prior to the
Closing that such Indebtedness shall remain outstanding. In the event Honeywell
elects to effect the Restructuring Transactions and Purchaser gives written
notice to Honeywell on or prior to the earlier of (i) December 1, 2005 or (ii)
ten (10) business days prior to the Closing that such Indebtedness shall remain
outstanding as an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as of
the Closing giving effect to the Restructuring Transactions), Honeywell shall
cause the receivable in respect of such Indebtedness to be contributed to
Security Printing, Inc. or assigned to Novar USA Inc., provided that such
contribution or assignment will not have any adverse consequences to Honeywell.
Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement, if Honeywell
elects to effect, and effects, the Restructuring Transactions pursuant to
Section 10.11, Honeywell shall not be obligated to discharge or extinguish (or
cause to be discharged or extinguished) any Indebtedness of Novar Finance, Inc.,
Novar Holdco, Inc. or Novar Investments (USA) Inc. owed to any Person (other
than the Company or its Subsidiaries as of Closing Date after giving effect to
the Restructuring Transactions).

                  (b)      To the extent that any obligations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Closing Date after giving effect to the
Restructuring Transactions, if applicable) are secured by a letter of credit or
guarantee by Honeywell or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any of the Company
or its Subsidiaries determined as of the Closing Date after giving effect to the
Restructuring Transactions, if applicable) (all of which are set forth in
Section 5.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule and, if Honeywell elects to effect,
and effects, the Restructuring Transactions pursuant to Section 10.11, item 6 of
Section 3.13(a)(iv)(C) of the Disclosure Schedule but only to the extent that it
relates to the SPS Business), and such letters of credit or guarantees cannot be
discharged or extinguished prior to or at the Closing Date, Purchaser and
Honeywell shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates to be substituted for Honeywell or a Subsidiary of
Honeywell (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), as applicable, with
respect to (and cause Honeywell or

                                       38
<PAGE>

such Subsidiary of Honeywell to be released from) such guarantees (or, if
feasible on commercially reasonable terms, to cause such guarantees to be
extinguished) prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) cause to be issued letters of
credit as replacement letters of credit for, or back-to-back letters of credit
supporting (for so long as the original letters of credit are in effect) such
letters of credit (but, in each case, solely to the extent allocated to the SPS
Business as set forth in Section 3.13(a)(iv)(C) of the Disclosure Schedule)
prior to the Closing Date. To the extent such guarantees cannot be extinguished
or substituted for, or such letters of credit cannot be replaced or supported by
back-to-back letters of credit, at or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to do so as promptly as practicable
following the Closing. In any event, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
Honeywell and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
harmless from and against (A) any and all Losses resulting from any payment
following the Closing Date by any of Honeywell or its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) under the guarantees or letters of credit set
forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule or, if Honeywell elects to
effect, and effects, the Restructuring Transactions pursuant to Section 10.11,
item 6 of Section 3.13(a)(iv)(C) of the Disclosure Schedule (as well as any
immaterial letters of credit or guarantees that Honeywell inadvertently excluded
from Section 5.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) and (B) in the case of such
letters of credit set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, any
bank fees incurred by any of Honeywell or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing Date to maintain such
letters of credit, in any such case, only to the extent that such Losses,
Liabilities or fees are (i) allocable to the SPS Business as set forth in
Section 3.13(a)(iv)(C) of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) (x) relate to periods
following the Closing or (y) are fully reflected as current liabilities in Final
Net Working Capital. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to any Excluded
Liability for which Honeywell has agreed to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
Article IX.

                  (c)      (i) With respect to the guarantees listed under items
6 and 7 of Section 3.13(a)(iv)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "TERMINABLE
GUARANTEES"), Honeywell shall cause Novar Holdco Inc., promptly but no later
than ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, to deliver termination
notices to the beneficiaries of the Terminable Guarantees in accordance with the
terms of such Terminable Guarantees and provide Purchaser with copies of such
notices; (ii) with respect to all guarantees listed in Section 3.13(a)(iv)(B) of
the Disclosure Schedule other than the Terminable Guarantees (the "OTHER
GUARANTEES" and, together with the Terminable Guarantees, the "NOVAR
GUARANTEES"), Honeywell shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (including
using commercially reasonable efforts to assume any liabilities under such Other
Guarantees) to cause the Other Guarantees to be terminated or assumed by
Honeywell as a substitute guarantor or, if acceptable to the other party to, or
beneficiary of, such Other Guarantee, any other Person (other than the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the Closing and (B) the closing
of the sale of the "Indalex Aluminum Solutions" business to Indalex Holding
Corp. or another third party; provided, however, that Honeywell shall be
relieved of its obligations under this Section 5.11(c)(ii) with respect to any
Other Guarantees if and at such time as Novar Holdco Inc. (or the Company or any
of its

                                       39
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, as the case may be) shall have been released and discharged from
any liability thereunder pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser (whether or not in connection with any substitution thereunder); and
(iii) with respect to all Novar Guarantees, Honeywell shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts (including using commercially reasonable efforts to assume
any liabilities under such Novar Guarantees) to cause Novar Holdco Inc. (or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be) from and after the
Closing to be released and discharged from any Liability (whether arising prior
to or following the Closing) under the Novar Guarantees pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. From and after the date
hereof, Honeywell shall not, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries not to,
(x) extend or amend (to the extent such amendment increases in any material
respect the exposure of Novar Holdco Inc. (or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be)) the applicable Contracts underlying the Novar
Guarantees or (y) incur any new Liabilities under such Contracts (other than
Liabilities incurred prior to the Closing in the ordinary course), in each case,
without the applicable Novar Guarantee being terminated or a Person (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) being substituted for Novar Holdco Inc.
(or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be) thereunder.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, Honeywell shall indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all liabilities in respect of the Novar
Guarantees pursuant to Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell
shall not have any obligations under this Section 5.11(c) from and after such
time as it elects to effect, and thereafter effects, the Restructuring
Transactions pursuant to Section 10.11.

                  (d)      With respect to the arrangement set forth under item
9 of Section 3.13(a)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule, in the event such
arrangement with respect to surety bonds associated with the SPS Business cannot
be discharged or extinguished prior to or at the Closing, Purchaser shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts (including using commercially reasonable
efforts to assume any liabilities under such arrangement as it relates to the
SPS Business) to either (i) cause Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted for Honeywell with respect to (and cause Honeywell to be released
from) such arrangement as it relates to the SPS Business or (ii) cancel all such
bonds such that Honeywell will have no liability with respect thereto under such
arrangement as it relates to the SPS Business, in either case, prior to the
Closing. To the extent such arrangement cannot be extinguished or substituted
for, at or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to do so as promptly as practicable following the Closing. In any event,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Honeywell and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) harmless from and against (A) any and all
Losses resulting from any payment following the Closing Date by any of Honeywell
or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) under such
arrangement as it relates to the SPS Business and (B) any fees incurred by any
of Honeywell or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) following the Closing Date to maintain such arrangement as it
relates to the SPS Business.

         5.12     INSURANCE MATTERS.

                                       40
<PAGE>

                  (a)      Except as set forth in Section 5.12(b), Honeywell
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep, or cause to be kept, all
insurance policies presently maintained that are material to the conduct of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their properties, or
replacements therefor, in full force and effect through the Closing. Except with
respect to the Occurrence Policies, as defined in Section 5.12(b), coverage for
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the Closing Date under
policies not directly held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (b)      Prior to the Closing Honeywell shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any carriers who have underwritten any global,
primary casualty and excess liability insurance policies which provides
insurance coverage to the Company and its Subsidiaries on an "occurrence" basis
(the "OCCURRENCE POLICIES") to continue to make coverage available to the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date for claims arising out
of occurrences prior to the Closing Date. Honeywell acknowledges (without making
any representation with respect to such Occurrence Policies, except as set forth
in Section 3.18) the right of Purchaser for access to the benefit of insurance
for such pre-Closing occurrences under the historic Occurrence Policies which
have provided coverage to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Following the
Closing Date, each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the
other party, at such other party's expense, in issuing notice of claims under
the Occurrence Policies, presenting such claims for payment and collecting
insurance proceeds related thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any right that
Purchaser shall have under the policies shall be limited to the terms and
conditions set forth therein. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Honeywell and
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any of Honeywell or such Affiliates
in connection with Honeywell's obligations under this Section 5.12(b) (including
any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with maintaining or
replenishing any loss fund or similar arrangement required under the Occurrence
Policies) (it being understood that Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted for Novar Inc. with respect to the portion of any loss fund or
similar arrangement associated with the SPS Business (and cause Novar Inc. to be
released with respect to such portion)).

                  (c)      On or prior to the Closing Date, Honeywell shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the underwriters and insurers of any
fiduciary liability policies and directors & officers liability insurance
policies which provide insurance coverage to any officer, director or employee
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "D&O POLICIES") to
provide quotations for extended coverage to individuals who will be officers,
directors or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing for a period of up to six (6) years on a "trailing" or "run-off" basis
on terms no less favorable (as determined by the parties acting reasonably) to
such D&O Policies maintained in effect by Honeywell or its Affiliates on the
date hereof (the "RUN-OFF COVERAGE"). Before entering into any agreement with
respect to Run-Off Coverage, Honeywell shall obtain Purchaser's consent to
purchase such Run-Off Coverage. Any such purchase shall be at Purchaser's sole
cost and expense. Amounts paid pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be
disregarded for

                                       41
<PAGE>

purposes of preparing the Preliminary Working Capital Statement or calculating
the Final Working Capital Statement pursuant to Section 2.3.

         5.13     NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. From and after the date hereof
and through the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Honeywell shall not (and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (other than clerical or non-salaried employees); provided,
HOWEVER, the foregoing shall not prohibit Honeywell from (a) engaging in the
general solicitation (whether by newspaper, trade publication or other
periodical) of employees (or hiring any employees that respond to such general
solicitation) so long as such solicitation is not directed at employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or at employees in the industries in which the SPS
Business operates as of the date hereof or the Closing Date, or (b) soliciting
or hiring any such employee (other than clerical or non-salaried employees) who
is no longer employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries and has not been an
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for at least six (6) months prior to
such solicitation or employment by Honeywell or its Affiliates.

         5.14     NON-COMPETITION.

                  (a)      For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date,
Honeywell agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, whether as principal, agent, partner, officer, director,
stockholder, employee, consultant or otherwise, alone or in association with any
other Person, own, manage, operate, control, participate in, acquire more than
five percent (5%) of (or the right to acquire more than five percent (5%) of)
any class of voting securities of, perform services for, or otherwise carry on,
a business which is in competition with the SPS Business (a "COMPETING
BUSINESS"). The restrictions set forth in this Section 5.14(a) shall not be
construed to prohibit or restrict Honeywell or any of its controlled Affiliates
from acquiring any Person or business that engages in any Competing Business
provided that (i) such activities do not constitute the principal activities of
the Person or business to be acquired (based on the sales of such business
during the preceding four (4) full calendar quarters) and (ii) if the Competing
Business constitutes in excess of five percent (5%) of the revenues of the
Person or business acquired, Honeywell will divest that portion of such Person
or business that engages in the Competing Business within nine (9) months after
such acquisition.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the prohibitions in Section 5.14(a) shall not apply to (i) any
businesses or operations of Honeywell or any of its Subsidiaries which are
transferred to any third party (other than to a Subsidiary of Honeywell) after
the date hereof, or (ii) to any Subsidiaries of Honeywell the stock of which is
transferred to any third party (other than to a Subsidiary of Honeywell) after
the date hereof.

                  (c)      Honeywell acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at
Law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this
Section 5.14 will be inadequate and, accordingly, Honeywell covenants and agrees
that Purchaser shall, in

                                       42
<PAGE>

addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have at Law, be
entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to the remedy of
specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened breach of such
covenant, as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction. In
addition, Honeywell and Purchaser agree that the terms of the covenant in this
Section 5.14 are fair and reasonable in light of Purchaser's plans for the SPS
Business and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and
other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.14 shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any
such provision or provisions shall not be deemed void, and the parties hereto
agree that said limits may be modified by the court and that said covenant
contained in this Section 5.14 shall be amended in accordance with said
modification, it being specifically agreed by the parties that it is their
continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to the full extent of its terms
and conditions or if a court finds the scope of the covenant unenforceable, the
court should redefine the covenant so as to comply with applicable Law.

         5.15     SPS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                  (a)      Honeywell acknowledges and agrees that the books,
records, data and other documents and confidential information concerning the
SPS Business and/or the products, services, customer development information
(including customer and prospect lists), sales activities and procedures,
promotional and marketing techniques, pricing, plans and strategies, financing,
development and expansion plans and credit and financial data concerning
customers and suppliers and other information of or to the extent relating to
the SPS Business, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are considered by
Purchaser to be confidential and in the nature of trade secrets, and are
valuable, special and unique assets of the SPS Business, access to and knowledge
of which are essential to preserve the goodwill, customer relationships and
ongoing business relationships of the SPS Business for the benefit of Purchaser.
Honeywell further agrees that all knowledge and information described in the
preceding sentence that is not in the public domain (unless such knowledge and
information is in the public domain as a result of a breach of this or any other
confidentiality agreement by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates) shall be
considered confidential information (collectively, the "SPS CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION"). For the avoidance of doubt, the term "SPS Confidential
Information" shall not include information that (i) does not relate to the SPS
Business, (ii) becomes available to Honeywell or any of its Affiliates on a
non-confidential basis from a source other the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, PROVIDED that to Honeywell's or any of its Affiliates' knowledge such
source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or similar obligation to
Purchaser, the Company or their Affiliates with respect to such information,
(iii) is independently developed by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates under
circumstances not involving a breach of this Section 5.15, or (iv) is publicly
disclosed pursuant to a lawful requirement or request from a Governmental
Authority acting within its jurisdiction, or non-confidential disclosure is
otherwise required by Law. As used in this Section 5.15, "knowledge" shall mean
the knowledge of Honeywell and its Affiliates and not the knowledge of the
individuals set forth in Section 10.2(a)(xvi) of the Disclosure Schedule.

                                       43
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Honeywell hereby agrees that following the Closing
Date it shall hold the SPS Confidential Information in confidence and not use or
disclose or cause or permit to be used or disclosed any of the SPS Confidential
Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever, except and to the extent any
disclosure of SPS Confidential Information is required by Law or appropriate
court order and sufficient advance written notice thereof, if permitted, is
provided to Purchaser to permit Purchaser to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. The foregoing obligations of Honeywell and its Subsidiaries
shall be in addition to and not lieu of any protections available to Purchaser
pursuant to any applicable Law regarding the protection of trade secrets. The
provisions of this Section 5.15 shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing.

         5.16     OTHER TRANSACTIONS. Honeywell shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its representatives to,
immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person that has made or indicated an intention to make an investment in or
takeover proposal for the Company, the SPS Business or any Subsidiary of the
Company or other substantial portion thereof. Honeywell shall promptly, and in
any event not later than ten (10) days following the date hereof, request that
each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with that
Person's consideration of a transaction involving the Company or the SPS
Business return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that Person
by or on behalf of Honeywell or its Subsidiaries.

         5.17     FINANCING.

                  (a)      Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain as of the Closing the debt financing under, and on the terms
and conditions described in, the Debt Commitment Letter (the "DEBT FINANCING"),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to
satisfy or cause to be waived all conditions in such definitive agreements.
Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not agree to any amendment or modification
of the Debt Commitment Letter that would adversely affect Purchaser's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of Honeywell. To the extent that the Debt Commitment Letter is
terminated or any or all of the borrowings or amounts under the Debt Commitment
Letter are otherwise unavailable for any reason, Purchaser shall give Honeywell
prompt notice thereof and use its reasonable best efforts (with the reasonable
cooperation of Honeywell) to arrange for alternative financing in an amount at
least equal to that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, provided that
nothing shall obligate Purchaser to enter into any replacement financing if the
terms and conditions of such replacement financing are materially less favorable
to Purchaser than the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter;

                  (b)      As soon as reasonably practicable, Honeywell shall
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company) and its and
their representatives to provide, including through the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any employees of Honeywell and its Affiliates who are
actively involved in the SPS Business,

                                       44

Debt Financing as may be requested by Purchaser (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including:

         Purchaser and to the extent reasonably available;

                           (iii)    assisting Purchaser and its financing
         sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any debt
         raised to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) materials
         for rating agency presentations, and (C) business projections;

efforts to cause all cash and cash equivalents held by any of the Companies or
their Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to be transferred to Honeywell or

Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent any
cash or cash equivalents held by any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time is not so transferred prior to the Closing, the

amount of such cash and cash equivalents not so transferred shall be reflected

Working Capital.

         5.19     TRANSITION SERVICES. Prior to the Closing, Honeywell and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith a transition services agreement for the
provision of any services which either party may reasonably request (to the
extent that such services have been performed by or on behalf of the SPS
Business), which services shall be provided at an amount equal to the cost of
providing such services (and, in any event, the recipient of such transition
services shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
provider thereof in connection with the provision of such services). In any
event, Purchaser shall provide those services that are reasonably requested by
Honeywell in connection with its preparation of any Tax Return that include the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to any pre-Closing period,
including if appropriate the preparation of the entire Tax Return. Purchaser
shall be entitled to charge Honeywell for such services an amount equal to the
cost of internal salary time (without markup for any overhead) and out-of-pocket
third party preparation fees.

         5.20     FUTURE TRANSACTION.

                  (a)      In the event that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
consummates an SPS Divestiture on or prior to the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date and receives Net Consideration of at least Eight Hundred Seventy
Five Million Dollars ($875,000,000), Purchaser shall pay to Honeywell, within
twenty-five (25) business days following the consummation of such SPS
Divestiture, an amount of cash (in immediately available funds) equal to 50% of
the excess of such Net Consideration over Eight Hundred Seventy Five Million
Dollars ($875,000,000).

                  (b)      For purposes hereof:

                           (i)      "NET CONSIDERATION" means, without
         duplication, the aggregate value of all consideration received by
         Purchaser or its Affiliates in an SPS Divestiture, which shall be
         calculated to include the value of all Indebtedness of the SPS Business
         which remains outstanding as of the closing of such SPS Divestiture
         (net of all cash and cash equivalents of the Company, its Subsidiaries
         or the SPS Business), in each case, net of all transactions fees and
         expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser and its
         Affiliates in connection with such SPS Divestiture.

                           (ii)     "SPS DIVESTITURE" means any sale or other
         disposition, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of
         all or substantially all of the SPS Business (whether by way of asset
         sale, stock offering or sale, distribution, merger, reorganization,
         liquidation or the like); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that none of (x) a
         spin-off or other disposition of all or any portion of the SPS Business
         to the stockholders of Purchaser (or any successor thereof), (y) any
         change of control, or other issuance, sale or disposition of the equity
         securities, of Purchaser (or any successor thereof) or (z) any other
         sale, issuance or other disposition of the SPS Business to an Affiliate
         of Purchaser or which

                                       48
<PAGE>

         results in Purchaser and its Affiliates retaining greater than 50% of
         the equity interests in the SPS Business shall be deemed to constitute
         an SPS Divestiture; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that, for the avoidance of doubt,
         the foregoing clause (z) shall not apply if Purchaser has sold
         substantially all of the assets of the SPS Business to a Person who is
         not (or as a result of the transaction does not become) an Affiliate of
         Purchaser.

                  (c)      For purposes of calculating the Net Consideration, if
all or any portion of the consideration involved in the SPS Divestiture is in
the form of: (i) cash, the consideration shall be valued based on the face value
of the cash; (ii) publicly traded securities, the consideration shall be valued
based on the volume-weighted average of the closing price of such securities for
the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the date of the consummation
of the SPS Divestiture; (iii) securities that are not publicly traded until the
date of completion of the SPS Divestiture, the consideration shall be valued
based on the volume-weighted average closing price of such securities for the
twenty (20) trading days immediately following the completion of the SPS
Divestiture; or (iv) any other consideration, the consideration shall be valued
at its fair market value as Honeywell and Purchaser shall mutually agree, acting
reasonably. In the event of any disagreement between the parties with respect to
the calculation of the Net Consideration received in any SPS Divestiture, the
matter will be submitted to an internationally recognized accounting firm to be
agreed upon by the parties, provided that such firm may not be the auditors of
either Honeywell or Purchaser. The decision of such accounting firm as to the
Net Consideration received in any SPS Divestiture will be final and binding on
the parties.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the rights of Honeywell set forth in this Section 5.20 shall
be assignable to any other Person.

         6.3      ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF HONEYWELL. The
obligations of Honeywell to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are subject to the fulfillment, on the Closing Date, of each of the

                  (a)      the representations and warranties of Purchaser

                                   ARTICLE VII
                               CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

         7.1      TAX RETURNS. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5:

                  (a)      Honeywell shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, and Honeywell shall prepare such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with past practices, except as required by applicable Law, and
shall remit or cause to be remitted when due all Taxes shown due on such Tax
Returns, as well as all Taxes payable by it (or them) that are due prior to the
Closing Date for which no such Tax Return is required; provided,

                                       51
<PAGE>

however, that if any such Tax Return to be filed or any Tax required to be paid
in accordance with this Section 7.1(a) is to be filed or paid after the Closing
Date, Honeywell shall remit to Purchaser the amounts required to be so paid no
later than five (5) business days prior to the due date for any such payment,
and Purchaser shall file and pay when due such Tax Returns and such Taxes.

                  (b)      With respect to any Tax Return described in Section
7.1(a), Honeywell shall provide Purchaser with such Tax Returns (including all
necessary supporting schedules and information), or, in the case of any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes Honeywell or any
Affiliate, a pro forma draft of the portion of such Tax Return (including all
necessary supporting schedules and information) reflecting only the tax items of
the Company or such Subsidiaries of the Company, as the case may be, at least 30
days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of
such Tax Return, and Purchaser and its authorized representatives shall have the
right to review and comment on such Tax Return (including any supporting
schedules or information) prior to the filing of such Tax Return. If Purchaser
disputes an item on such Tax Return on the grounds that it is inconsistent with
past practice and could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
future Tax periods, it shall notify Honeywell and the Seller of such disputed
item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax
Return is required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item,
the item in question shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm. The
fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Honeywell
and Purchaser. Purchaser's failure to comment shall not prevent or preclude
Honeywell from timely filing with the appropriate Taxing authority such Tax
Returns. Purchaser shall at its own cost and expense fully and accurately
complete and submit any Tax data packages required by Honeywell within the time
periods established by the Tax Department of Honeywell consistent with past
practices.

                  (c)      Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending after
the Closing Date (other than Tax Returns with respect to periods for which a
consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of the Seller or any Subsidiary of
the Seller other than the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company will
include the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). In the case of Tax Returns
relating to taxable periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
("STRADDLE PERIODS"), to the extent such Tax Returns relate to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practices and shall remit or cause
to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to any
such Tax Returns filed with respect to any Straddle Period, Honeywell shall be
responsible for the portion of Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns relating
to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, determined in
accordance with Section 7.4(c). Purchaser shall notify Honeywell of any amounts
due from Honeywell in respect of any such Tax Return no later than ten (10)
business days prior to the date on which such Tax

                                       52
<PAGE>

Return is due, and Honeywell shall remit such payment to Purchaser no later than
five (5) business days prior to the date such Tax Return is due.

                  (d)      With respect to any Tax Return described in Section
7.l (c) as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to, or would otherwise be
borne by, Honeywell, or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries), Purchaser shall provide Honeywell with a copy of such completed
Tax Return (including all necessary supporting schedules and information) at
least 30 days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the
filing of such Tax Return, and Honeywell and its authorized representatives
shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return (including any
supporting schedules or information) prior to the filing of such Tax Return. If
Honeywell disputes an item on such Tax Return on the grounds that it is
inconsistent with past practice and could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse affect on Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, it shall
notify Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its
objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior
to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If the
parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by Honeywell and Purchaser. Honeywell's failure to
comment shall not prevent or preclude Purchaser from timely filing with the
appropriate Taxing authority such Tax Returns.

         7.2      COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS; TAX AUDITS AND CONTESTS.

                  (a)      After the Closing Date, except as provided in (b) and
(c) below, Purchaser shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such audit, claim for refund, or
proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a
"CONTEST").

                  (b)      In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that
relates solely to Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified under Section 7.4,
Honeywell shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Honeywell shall
not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is
reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for any taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, that if Honeywell fails to assume control of the
conduct of any such Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by
Honeywell of notice of such Contest, Purchaser shall have the right to assume
control of such Contest and shall have the right to settle, compromise and/or
concede such Contest in its sole discretion.

                  (c)      In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that
relates both to Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified under Section 7.4 and
Taxes for which Purchaser is not indemnified under Section 7.4, Purchaser shall
control the conduct of

                                       53
<PAGE>

such Contest, but Honeywell shall have the right to participate in such Contest
at its own expense, and Purchaser shall not settle, compromise and/or concede
any portion of such Contest as relates to a period ending on or before the
Closing Date, or is reasonably likely to effect the Tax liability of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for any taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning prior to
the Closing Date, without the consent of Honeywell, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (d)      Purchaser and Honeywell shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article VII and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Honeywell agrees (i) to retain and maintain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority,
and (ii) to give Purchaser reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Purchaser so
requests, Honeywell shall allow Purchaser to take possession of such books and
records.

                  (e)      Purchaser and Honeywell further agree, upon request,
to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

         7.3      TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All Tax Sharing Agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

         7.4      TAX INDEMNIFICATIONS.

                  (a)      From and after the Closing Date, Honeywell shall be
liable for, and shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
harmless against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other outside consultants'
fees and expenses) suffered or incurred (each a "TAX LOSS" and collectively, the
"TAX LOSSES") arising out of:

                           (i)      all Taxes imposed on any member of any
         Affiliated Group that includes Honeywell with which the Company or its
         Subsidiaries files or filed a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined or
         unitary basis for a taxable year (of the Company or any Subsidiary
         thereof) beginning before the Closing

                                       54
<PAGE>

         Date and for which the Company or Subsidiary thereof is liable pursuant
         to Treas. Reg. 1.1502-6, Treas. Reg. 1.1502-78 or a comparable
         provision of Law, solely as a result of its inclusion in such a
         consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return;

                           (ii)     except as provided in Section 7.6, all Taxes
         arising out of any transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

                           (iii)    all Taxes or other payments required to be
         paid after the Closing Date by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         to any party (other than to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
         under any Tax Sharing Agreement entered into on or before the Closing
         Date (whether written or not) by reason of being a
         successor-in-interest or transferee of another entity.

                  (b)      Honeywell shall be liable for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Company, and the
Company's Subsidiaries against, Tax Losses arising out of all of the following
Taxes: (i) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to taxable periods of the Company or such Subsidiaries ending on or before the
Closing Date; (ii) Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
are allocable, pursuant to Section 7.4(c), to the portion of such period ending
on the Closing Date; and (iii) Taxes arising out of any breach of any
representation contained in Section 3.6 or 3.7 or any covenant contained in
Section 5.1(g) with respect to any Straddle Period.

                  (c)      In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to
the Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

                           (i)      in the case of Taxes that are either (x)
         based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in
         connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property
         (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances
         pursuant to this Agreement), deemed equal to the amount which would be
         payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date; and

                           (ii)     in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
         basis with respect to the assets or otherwise measured by the level of
         any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
         (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
         amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied
         by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
         the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
         the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit
         or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period
         shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this Section 7.4(c)
         taking into account the type of the Tax to which the refund relates. In
         the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net
         worth or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to
         be allocated under this Section 7.4(c) shall be computed by reference
         to the level of such items on the Closing Date.

                                       55
<PAGE>

         All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall
         be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.

         7.5      TAX INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

                  (a)      After the Closing, each party to this Agreement
(whether Purchaser or Honeywell, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an
audit received by such party from any Taxing Authority or any other Person with
respect to Taxes for which such other party is liable pursuant to Section 7.4;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a failure to give such notice will not affect such other
party's rights to indemnification under this Article VII, except to the extent
that such party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability
and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document
received from any Taxing Authority or any other Person in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability.

                  (b)      Payment by an indemnitor of any amount due to an
indemnitee under Section 7.4 of this Agreement shall be made within ten (10)
days following written notice by the indemnitee that payment of such amounts to
the appropriate Taxing Authority or other applicable third party is due by the
indemnitee, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any
payment earlier than five (5) business days before it is due to the appropriate
Taxing Authority or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2, payment of such
contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date a "final
determination" to such effect is made by such Taxing Authority or a court. For
this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a settlement, compromise, or
other agreement with the relevant Taxing Authority, whether contained in an IRS
Form 870 or other comparable form, or otherwise, or such procedurally later
event, such as a closing agreement with the relevant Taxing Authority, and
agreement contained in IRS Form 870-D or other comparable form, an agreement
that constitutes a "determination" under Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a
deficiency notice with respect to which the period for filing a petition with
the tax court or the relevant state, local or foreign tribunal has expired or a
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or
as to which the time for appeal has expired.

                  (c)      All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this
Article VII shall be paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to a bank account designated by the indemnified party.

                  (d)      Any payments required pursuant to this Article VII
that are not made within the time period specified in this Section 7.5 shall
bear interest at a rate and in the manner provided in the Code for interest on
underpayments of federal income tax.

         7.6      CERTAIN TAXES. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest)

                                       56
<PAGE>

incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be shared equally by Honeywell
and Purchaser, and Purchaser shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees (and Honeywell shall promptly reimburse
Purchaser for one half of the expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with
any such filing).

         7.7      TAX REFUNDS. Honeywell shall be entitled to (a) all refunds of
Taxes received by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to taxable
periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date
(other than refunds of Taxes attributable to carry backs of losses or credits
from taxable periods ending after the Closing Date), and (b) all refunds of
Taxes allocable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
as determined pursuant to Section 7.4(c). Purchaser shall cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries to pay any such Tax refunds received by any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to Honeywell within ten (10) days of receipt thereof, net of
any increase in Taxes paid by Purchaser on account of receipt of such Tax refund
and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Purchaser in obtaining such refund.
For purposes of this Section 7.7, Tax refunds shall include any Tax refunds that
are (i) actually received by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) credited
against Tax liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries for periods
beginning after the Closing Date or for the portion of any Straddle Period after
the Closing Date.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TERMINATION

         8.1      TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
before the Effective Time as follows:

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of Honeywell and Purchaser;

                  (b)      by Honeywell or Purchaser on or after the four (4)
month anniversary of the date hereof (or, if Honeywell has not provided (or
caused to be provided) the Recent Financial Information to Purchaser on or prior
to November 15, 2005, the five (5) month anniversary of the date hereof) (the
"OUTSIDE DATE") if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business
on such date; provided, however, that if on the Outside Date the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 6.2(f) shall not have been satisfied but all other
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied (or
waived, if permitted), or capable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, then
the Outside Date shall be extended to the two (2) month anniversary of the
Outside Date if Honeywell notifies the Purchaser in writing of its election to
so extend the Outside Date; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER that the breach by the
terminating party in any material respect of any of its covenants or other
obligations hereunder shall not be the principal cause of the failure of the
Closing to occur by the Outside Date;

                  (c)      by Honeywell or Purchaser if there shall be in effect
a final nonappealable Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

                                       57
<PAGE>

                  (d)      by Purchaser if there shall have been a breach in any
material respect of any of the covenants or agreements on the part of Honeywell
set forth in this Agreement or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Honeywell that would cause the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied, in each case which has not been cured within
30 days after receipt of notice of such breach;

                  (e)      by Honeywell if there shall have been a breach in any
material respect of any of the covenants or agreements on the part of Purchaser
set forth in this Agreement or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Purchaser that would cause the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied, in each case which has not been cured within
30 days after receipt of notice of such breach; and

                  (f)      by Purchaser if Honeywell shall not have provided (or
caused to be provided) the Recent Financial Statements to Purchaser on or prior
to December 31, 2005.

         8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
(other than as set forth in Section 3.21, Section 3.22, Section 4.6, Section
4.9, the first sentence of Section 5.4(a), Section 5.8, this Section 8.2,
Section 10.7, Section 10.8 and Section 10.9) shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its Affiliates or
representatives); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto from any liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                          NO SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1      SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in Articles III and IV
shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.1, terminate on the date
that is one (1) year after the Closing Date, except that (a) the representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.11 shall survive for three (3) years
following the Closing, (b) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.7 and Section 3.12 shall survive the Closing until the date that is 60
days following the expiration of the statute of limitations (including all
periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) for the applicable
representation and warranty and (c) the representations and warranties contained
in Section 3.2, Section 3.4, Section 3.21, Section 3.22, Section 4.2, Section
4.6 and Section 4.9 shall survive indefinitely following the Closing. All
covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (other than Section 5.1, which shall
terminate on the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date). The period
of time a representation or warranty or covenant or agreement survives the
Closing pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be the "SURVIVAL PERIOD" with respect
to such representation or warranty or covenant or agreement. In the event notice
of any claim for indemnification under this Article IX shall have been given
within the applicable Survival Period and

                                       58
<PAGE>

such claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival
Period, the representations or warranties or covenants or agreements that are
the subject of such claim shall survive, but only to the extent related to the
facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim, until such matters are
finally resolved.

         9.2      INDEMNIFICATION. Subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing Date:

                  (a)      Honeywell shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and each of
their respective officers, directors, members, partners, managers and employees
(collectively, the "PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against any Losses
that are imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out
of or related or attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Honeywell in this Agreement, (ii) any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of Honeywell set forth in this Agreement, (iii) any ERISA
Affiliate Liability, (iv) any Liabilities of the Company, Novar Investments
(USA) Inc., Novar Finance Inc. or Novar Holdco Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries
(other than Security Printing, Inc. and its Subsidiaries) under guarantees or
letters of credit given by them on behalf of Affiliates or any other Person to
the extent unrelated to the SPS Business (which shall include all of the Novar
Guarantees), (v) any Liabilities of the Company, Novar Investments (USA) Inc.,
Novar Finance Inc. or Novar Holdco Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries (other than
Security Printing, Inc. and its Subsidiaries), other than Permitted Holding
Company Liabilities (the Liabilities referred to in clause (iv) and (v), the
"EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"), and (vi) any Indebtedness outstanding as of the
Effective Time that is required to be discharged or otherwise extinguished prior
to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement but which is not so discharged or
otherwise extinguished prior to the Closing or any other Indebtedness that
constitutes an Excluded Liability.

                  (b)      Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Honeywell
and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and each of
their respective officers, directors, members, partners, managers and employees
(collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against any Losses
that are imposed on or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of
or related or attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by Purchaser in this Agreement and (ii) any failure to perform any covenant
or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

         9.3      INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

                  (a)      In order for a party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Article IX in respect of
a claim made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement (a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), such Indemnified Party must notify the
indemnifying party hereunder (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice
of the Third-Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to give such
notification (or to provide any of the notices or documents contemplated by the
next sentence) shall not affect the indemnification provided

                                       59
<PAGE>

hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than
those notices and documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions related to the settlement
of Third-Party Claims set forth in Section 9.3(c), the Indemnifying Party will
have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third-Party Claim (other than a Third-Party Claim relating to or involving a
customer or supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries (which shall be
controlled at all times by the Company or Purchaser, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Honeywell)) which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder and to select counsel of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party). If the Indemnifying Party does not, within
twenty-one (21) days of its receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
Section 9.3(a), elect to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim. If the applicable
Indemnified Party defends any Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnified Party for the reasonable
costs and expenses of defending such Third-Party Claim upon submission of
periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such applicable
Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by
the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the applicable Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the applicable Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that
would make such separate representation advisable; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more than one (1) such
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third-Party Claim.

                  (c)      If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the
applicable Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the other party shall (and shall cause the applicable Indemnified Parties to)
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that (i) by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party (or its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the liability
in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not require any payment,
admission or other action by, or limitation on, any Indemnified Party, and (iii)
releases all Indemnified Parties in connection with such Third-Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
or in the event of a Third-Party Claim relating to or involving a customer or
supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the applicable Indemnified Parties
shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim

                                       60
<PAGE>

without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

                  (d)      In the event any Indemnified Party should have a
claim against any Indemnifying Party under this Article IX that does not involve
a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware
of the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party under this Article IX, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure.

         9.4      INDEMNIFICATION LIMITATIONS.

                  (a)      In no event shall Honeywell be liable for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate of
all Losses with respect to Section 9.2(a)(i) that are imposed on or incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000)
(the "DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT"), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Deductible
Amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Losses in respect of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.4, 3.7 and 3.11 (the
"EXCLUDED REPRESENTATIONS") shall be recoverable from the first dollar of Loss
and shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount (and, as such, shall not
reduce the Deductible Amount otherwise available). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Honeywell shall not be required to make payments for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) in an aggregate amount in excess of One Hundred
Sixty Million Dollars ($160,000,000), other than in connection with breaches of
any of the Excluded Representations. Purchaser shall not be required to make
payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i) in an aggregate
amount in excess of One Hundred Sixty Million Dollars ($160,000,000).

                  (b)      In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified
Party hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined
without duplication of any other Loss which is actually recovered pursuant to
Article VII or this Article IX and shall be computed net of payments actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Losses (it being understood and agreed that, without affecting the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder (unless proceeds are
recovered), the Indemnified Party shall, where appropriate and commercially
reasonable, make claims under applicable insurance policies, other than
self-insurance or retrospective policies but that the Indemnified Party shall
have no obligation to engage in any litigation in connection therewith);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no
obligation to make any claim under any insurance policy in respect of Losses
related to any Excluded Liability or Indebtedness for which Honeywell is
obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 9.2(a). Any indemnification payment
payable under this Agreement shall be net of any Tax Benefit actually realized
by the Indemnified Party in respect of any indemnified Loss. For purposes
hereof, "TAX BENEFIT" means any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount
of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid as result of such indemnified

                                       61
<PAGE>

Loss (with the timing of the receipt or realization of such refund or reduction
to be estimated in good faith by the Indemnified Party), net of any increase in
Taxes paid by the Indemnified Party on account of receipt of the indemnification
payment. Purchaser shall cause its independent auditor to certify in writing to
Honeywell if and when Purchaser receives or realizes such refund or reduction,
and such certification shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
thereof.

                  (c)      In no event shall Honeywell or Purchaser be liable
for (i) any punitive or consequential damages regardless of the form of action
through which such damages are sought or (ii) any lost profits of any Person
(but only to the extent that such lost profits would be deemed to constitute
consequential damages), unless, in the case of clause (i) and (ii) above, but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 9.4, such damages are recovered
by a third party in a Third Party Claim pursuant to an order entered against a
Purchaser Indemnified Party or in a settlement agreement to which a Purchaser
Indemnified Party is a party (it being understood that the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall promptly appeal any such order if Honeywell requests it to do so,
provided that Honeywell promptly pays all fees, expenses, costs and damages
incurred through to such date and pays all fees, expenses, costs and damages
when and as incurred after such date, in each case, which are incurred in
connection with such Third Party Claim and posts any necessary bonds pending
such appeal); PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not apply to indemnification for
Losses that are imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
arising out of or related or attributable to (i) the Excluded Liabilities or
(ii) any Indebtedness for which Honeywell is obligated to indemnify pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(iv). The Parties acknowledge that, subject to the other
provisions of Section 9.4, nothing in this Section 9.4(c) shall limit
Purchaser's right to seek damages (other than punitive or consequential damages)
corresponding to the diminution in value, if any, of the SPI Group as measured
against the Purchase Price arising out of or related to Seller's breach of the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement. By way of
illustration, in such event, Purchaser would be entitled to seek damages
corresponding to the amount by which Purchaser would have reduced the Purchase
Price paid at closing for the SPI Group (using the same valuation methodology
used by Purchaser at the time of its execution and delivery of this Agreement to
determine the amount of the Purchase Price) had Purchaser been aware of such
breach on the Closing Date.

                  (d)      The remedies provided in this Article IX, Article VII
and, if the Restructuring Transactions are not consummated pursuant to Section
10.11(a), Section 10.11(b) shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of
the parties, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, except with respect to claims based on fraud which shall, in any case,
be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.21, 3.22, 4.6, 4.9, 10.8 and 10.9 of
this Agreement. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from seeking injunctive
relief as provided in Section 5.14. All payments made pursuant to this Articles
VII and IX shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Honeywell shall not be liable for any Losses related to any breach or
inaccuracy of any

                                       62
<PAGE>

representation or warranty contained in Section 3.11 (Environmental Matters) to
the extent such Loss or Losses (i) arise from any conduct by any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Company and its Subsidiaries after Closing,
including (A) any Management of any Materials of Environmental Concern and (B)
failure to comply with any Environmental Law (except for Continuing
Noncompliance); (ii) are not required to be incurred pursuant to any
Environmental Law or pursuant to any Environmental Claim; (iii) at any Property,
are required to be incurred by a clean-up or remediation standard that is more
costly than the lowest-cost clean-up standard reasonably applicable pursuant to
Environmental Laws to allow continued operation of the relevant Property in the
manner that it was operated at the Closing; or (iv) are detected or caused by
any Voluntary Environmental Investigation. For purposes of this paragraph, (i)
"MANAGEMENT" means generation, production, handling, distribution, processing,
storage, treatment, operation, transportation, recycling, reuse and/or disposal,
as those terms are defined in any Environmental Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Management does not include the ongoing release of Materials of Environmental
Concern which is not known to the Company and its Subsidiaries if such release
results from a pre-closing condition; (ii) "VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL
INVESTIGATION" means any environmental sampling, monitoring or other surface or
subsurface investigation of the Property except to the extent required by any
Environmental Law or reasonably conducted in response to a Third-Party Claim
asserting liability for an environmental condition at the Property; and (iii)
"CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE" means any failure to comply with Environmental Laws
that began prior to the Closing and continues after the Closing, except that
Continuing Noncompliance shall not include any noncompliance after the date that
any officer, employee or agent of the Purchaser Indemnified Party either (i)
learned of the noncompliance or (ii) in the ordinary course of operating the SPS
Business, should have learned of the noncompliance, it being understood that the
ordinary course of operating the SPS Business shall be deemed not to include any
Voluntary Environmental Investigation.

                  (f)      In the event that Honeywell is obligated to indemnify
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any clean-up or remediation
pursuant to this Agreement, Honeywell will have the right, but not the
obligation, to manage and control the clean-up or remediation; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if Honeywell elects to manage and control the clean-up or
remediation (i) any such clean-up or remediation shall be conducted in a timely
manner consistent with applicable Environmental Laws and shall not unreasonably
interfere with the continued operations of the SPS Business; (ii) Honeywell
shall provide the Purchaser Indemnified Party with a reasonable opportunity to
review proposed governmental filings and material proposed remediation decisions
in connection with such clean-up or remediation; (iii) Honeywell shall
reasonably consult with the Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with such
clean-up or remediation; and (iv) the approval of the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall be required for any such governmental filings and remediation
decisions; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such approval is unreasonably withheld or
delayed, Honeywell may proceed with the governmental filing or remediation
decisions as proposed by Honeywell; and (iv) in the event that Honeywell
requires access to any Property in connection with such clean-up or

                                       63
<PAGE>

remediation, Honeywell and the relevant Purchaser Indemnified Party shall enter
into a commercially reasonable access and indemnity agreement governing such
access.

Articles, Sections, or Disclosure Schedule, such reference is to an Article or a
Section of, or Disclosure Schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a party or parties,
such reference is to parties to this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, Honeywell and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original
intent as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules attached hereto, the Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and any certificate or side letter
delivered in connection herewith (that is referenced as a certificate or side

any rights or remedies hereunder.

         10.5     AMENDMENT; WAIVER. This Agreement maybe amended only in a
writing signed by all parties hereto. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be set
forth in writing. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the terms
or conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or waive
either party's rights at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with
every term or condition of this Agreement.

         10.6     BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives and successors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement
shall not be assigned by any party hereto by operation of Law or otherwise
without the express written consent of each of the other parties; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (i) Purchaser may, at its election and provided it remains liable
for its obligations hereunder, assign its rights (but not its obligations) under
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Purchaser (or to any successor to Purchaser
by way of merger or otherwise) and (ii) Purchaser or any such assignee may make
a collateral assignment of its rights (but not its obligations) under this
Agreement to any lender providing financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         10.7     DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. The Disclosure Schedule shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as
if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed pursuant to
the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation
as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.

         10.8     GOVERNING LAW. Any and all claims, disputes or controversies
in any way arising out of or relating to (a) this Agreement, (b) any breach or
termination of, or the validity of, this Agreement, (c) the transactions
contemplated hereby or (d) any discussions or communications relating in any way
to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby, and the existence or
validity of any and all defenses to such claims, disputes or controversies,
shall be governed and resolved exclusively by the laws of the State of New York,
notwithstanding the existence of any conflict of laws principles that otherwise
would dictate the application of any other State's law. Each party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right to object to the application of New York
law, or argue against its applicability to any of the matters referenced in the
immediately preceding sentence.

         10.9     DISPUTE RESOLUTION; MEDIATION; JURISDICTION.

                  (a)      In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or
validity thereof, or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "DISPUTE"), upon
the written notice of either party hereto, the parties hereto shall attempt to
negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. If the parties hereto are unable for any
reason to resolve a Dispute within 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the
Dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with Section 10.9(b)
hereof.

                                       72
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Any Dispute not resolved pursuant to Section 10.9(a)
hereof shall, at the request of either party hereto (a "MEDIATION REQUEST"), be
submitted to non-binding mediation in accordance with the then current CPR
Mediation Procedure (the "PROCEDURE"), except as modified herein. The mediation
shall be held in New York, New York. The parties shall have 20 days from receipt
by a party of a Mediation Request to agree on a mediator. If no mediator has
been agreed upon by the parties within 20 days of receipt by a party (or
parties) of a Mediation Request, then any party may request (on written notice
to the other parties), that the CPR appoint a mediator in accordance with the
Procedure. All mediation pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall
be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or documentary
representations made by the parties during such mediation shall be admissible
for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings. No party hereto shall disclose or
permit the disclosure of any information about the evidence adduced or the
documents produced by the other parties in the mediation proceedings or about
the existence, contents or results of the mediation without the prior written
consent of such other parties except in the course of a judicial or regulatory
proceeding or as may be required by Law or requested by a Governmental Authority
or securities exchange. Before making any disclosure permitted by the preceding
sentence, the party intending to make such disclosure shall give the other
parties reasonable written notice of the intended disclosure and afford the
other parties a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. If the Dispute
has not been resolved within 60 days of the appointment of a Mediator, or within
90 days of receipt by a party of a Mediation Request (whichever occurs sooner),
or within such longer period as the parties may agree to in writing, then any
party may file an action on the Dispute in any court having jurisdiction in
accordance with Section 10.9(c).

                  (c)      Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
of the State of New York and the courts of the United States of America located
in the State of New York for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating hereto except in such courts), and further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its respective
address set forth in Section 10.1, shall be effective service of process for any
litigation brought against it in any such court. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any litigation arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of the
State of New York or the courts of the United States of America located in the
State of New York and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such litigation brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY OF THE
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         10.10    CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.

                  (a)      At or prior to the Closing, Honeywell shall cause the
Company, Novar Investments (USA), Inc., Novar Finance Inc. and Novar Holdco Inc.
to consolidate pursuant to one or more mergers reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser such that, following such consolidation, Security Printing, Inc. is a
direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, with the other corporations
ceasing to exist; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Honeywell shall not have any
obligation under this sentence if Honeywell elects to effect, and thereafter
effects, the Restructuring Transactions.

                  (b)      Promptly following the Closing, Purchaser shall, to
the extent the Company continues to exist as a separate entity, change its name

that, as between Honeywell and Purchaser, Honeywell is retaining all rights to
the name "Novar."

         10.11    CERTAIN ACTIONS At or prior to the Closing, Honeywell shall
take (or cause to be taken) either the series of actions set forth below in
Section 10.11(a) or the series of actions set forth below in Section 10.11(b),
as it determines in its sole discretion (and with reasonable notice to
Purchaser):

                  (a)      Honeywell shall cause the following actions
(collectively, the "RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS") to occur in the following order
(such that following the completion of the Restructuring Transactions, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no Liability on or after the Closing
with respect to the Novar Guarantees and the Other New Guarantees):

                           (i)      Each of Novar Holdco Inc. and Novar
         Investments (USA) Inc. shall be converted into Delaware limited
         liability companies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
         Delaware General Corporation Law.

                           (ii)     Novar Finance Inc. shall either be (A)
         converted into a Delaware limited liability company in accordance with
         the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or
         (B) merged with and into Novar Investments (USA) Inc.

                           (iii)    Novar Holdco Inc. shall distribute all of
         the outstanding shares of capital stock of Security Printing, Inc. to
         Novar Finance Inc. or, if Novar Finance Inc. has been merged with and
         into Novar Investments (USA) Inc., to Novar Investments (USA) Inc.

                           (iv)     Novar Finance Inc., to the extent that it
         has not been merged with and into Novar Investments (USA) Inc., shall
         distribute all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Security
         Printing, Inc. to Novar Investments (USA) Inc.

                                       74
<PAGE>

                           (v)      Novar Investments (USA) Inc. shall
         distribute all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Security
         Printing, Inc. to Novar USA Inc.

                           (vi)     All of the outstanding limited liability
         company interests in Novar Investments (USA) Inc. (as converted) held
         by Novar USA Inc. shall be distributed to Honeywell.

                  (b)      Honeywell (and, to the extent applicable, Purchaser)
shall take the following actions:

                           (i)      As security for the performance of the
         indemnification obligations of Honeywell under Section 9.2(a)(iv) with
         respect to the Novar Guarantees and any other guarantee (the "OTHER NEW
         GUARANTEES") given by the Company, Novar Investments (USA) Inc., Novar
         Finance Inc. or Novar Holdco Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries (other
         than Security Printing, Inc. and its Subsidiaries) to the extent
         unrelated to the SPS Business (in each case other than any such
         guarantees as to which Novar Holdco Inc. (or the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries, as the case may be) shall have been released and
         discharged from all Liabilities under any such guarantee on or prior to
         the Closing Date), Honeywell shall deliver to Purchaser an irrevocable
         letter of credit, in a form reasonably acceptable to Honeywell and
         Purchaser, issued by an Eligible Bank, in the initial face amount equal
         to the lesser of (i) $60,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate amount as may
         be necessary to secure the maximum exposure under such guarantees, as
         reasonably agreed upon by Honeywell and Purchaser (the "LETTER OF
         CREDIT"). "ELIGIBLE BANK" means a banking, financial or other similar
         institution capable of issuing the Letter of Credit (i) the
         Dollar-denominated long-term senior unsecured debt obligations of which
         shall be rated at least AA by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's and (ii) which
         maintains an office in New York City at which the Letter of Credit may
         be drawn.

                           (ii)     Purchaser shall deliver a written notice to
         Honeywell at least two (2) business days prior to drawing down any
         amounts under the Letter of Credit, which notice shall specify the
         amount to be so drawn down and shall include a copy of the notice of
         the demand for payment (or description thereof to the extent such
         notice has not been delivered in writing) received by Purchaser (or its
         Affiliates) from the beneficiary under the applicable guarantee.
         Purchaser shall be entitled to draw upon the Letter of Credit only if
         and to the extent Honeywell has not paid to Purchaser the amount to be
         so drawn down (as specified in such notice) within two (2) business
         days of Honeywell's receipt of such notice from Purchaser. To effect a
         draw down, Purchaser shall deliver a sight draft to the issuer of the
         Letter of Credit (with a copy to be delivered to Honeywell
         simultaneously) in the amount to which it is entitled pursuant to this
         Section 10.11(b)(ii), together with a certificate signed by a Vice
         President or the General Counsel of Purchaser which certifies (A) the
         amount to which Purchaser is entitled to draw upon pursuant to this
         Section 10.11(b)(ii), (B) that Purchaser has complied with its
         obligation to deliver the notice described in

                                       75
<PAGE>

         the first sentence hereof and (C) that Purchaser has not received any
         payment in respect of the demand for payment specified in such notice
         from Honeywell prior to the expiration of the two (2) business day
         period described above. In the event that Honeywell makes an
         indemnification payment within the two (2) business day time period
         referred to above or Purchaser draws upon the Letter of Credit,
         Purchaser acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and its
         Affiliates) that, (A) such payment or draw down, as applicable, shall
         be in full satisfaction of Honeywell's obligations with respect to the
         amount of such claim under such guarantee, (B) Honeywell shall be
         subrogated, to the extent of such payment or draw down, as applicable,
         to any rights that Purchaser or the applicable guarantor may have
         against the beneficiary under the applicable guarantee with respect to
         the subject matter (including the validity) of such claim for which an
         indemnity payment was made or draw down occurred, and (C) Purchaser
         shall take (or cause to be taken), at Honeywell's expense, such actions
         as Honeywell may reasonably request to perfect such subrogation or to
         pursue such rights against such beneficiary as Purchaser or the
         applicable guarantor may have with respect thereto (it being understood
         that in no event shall Purchaser be required to provide more than
         reasonable cooperation in connection with any litigation, arbitration
         or similar proceeding).

                           (iii)    Honeywell's obligation to maintain the
         Letter of Credit shall continue until the second anniversary of the
         Closing Date (the "L/C TERMINATION DATE"); PROVIDED, that (A) the
         expiration date of the Letter of Credit may be a date prior to the L/C
         Termination Date if the terms of the then existing Letter of Credit
         allow for it to be drawn down in full at or prior to its expiration
         date unless Honeywell has put in place, at least thirty (30) days prior
         to the expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit, a
         substitute letter of credit containing the same terms and conditions as
         the then existing Letter of Credit in the then-existing face amount
         issued by an Eligible Bank which shall take effect no later than the
         expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit and shall
         thereafter be deemed to be the Letter of Credit and (B) if the issuing
         bank of the then existing Letter of Credit is no longer an Eligible
         Bank, then Purchaser shall be permitted to draw down in full such
         Letter of Credit unless Honeywell has put in place within thirty (30)
         days of such event a substitute letter of credit containing the same
         terms and conditions as the then existing Letter of Credit in the then
         existing face amount issued by an Eligible Bank, which shall thereafter
         be deemed to be the Letter of Credit. In the event that Purchaser so
         draws down upon the Letter of Credit, Purchaser shall hold any funds so
         received in escrow, drawing down on such escrowed funds only to the
         extent it could have so drawn down under the Letter of Credit and
         returning to Honeywell on the L/C Termination Date or, if applicable,
         such earlier date when the face amount of the Letter of Credit would
         have been reduced to zero (0) in accordance with the terms hereof, any
         funds not so drawn down upon by the L/C Termination Date or, if
         applicable, such earlier date.

                           (iv)     If and at such time after the Closing Date
         as events shall occur (such as any of the applicable guarantors shall
         have been released or

                                       76
<PAGE>

         discharged from all Liabilities under the applicable guarantee (whether
         or not in connection with any substitution or assumption by another
         Person thereunder) or the obligations underlying the applicable
         guarantee shall have expired) reducing the maximum aggregate exposure
         under all Novar Guarantees and Other New Guarantees, Honeywell and
         Purchaser shall discuss in good faith an appropriate reduction in the
         face amount of the Letter of Credit based on the aggregate amount as
         may be necessary to secure the maximum aggregate remaining exposure
         under the remaining Novar Guarantees and Other New Guarantees.
         Similarly, if and at such time after the Closing events shall occur
         (such as the parties identify any additional Other New Guarantees)
         increasing the maximum aggregate exposure under all Novar Guarantees
         and Other New Guarantees, Honeywell and Purchaser shall discuss in good
         faith an appropriate increase in the face amount of the Letter of
         Credit based on the aggregate amount as may be necessary to secure the
         maximum exposure under such newly identified guarantee(s); PROVIDED,
         that any such increase in the face amount of the Letter of Credit shall
         not be for an amount greater than $60,000,000 (less any amounts that
         have been previously drawn under the Letter of Credit and less any
         indemnification payments made by Honeywell to Purchaser described in
         sub-section (ii) above). Once any new face amount for the Letter of
         Credit is determined pursuant to this Section 10.11(b)(iv), Honeywell
         and Purchaser shall deliver a certificate to the issuer of the Letter
         of Credit certifying that, pursuant to the provisions of this Section
         10.11, the face amount of the Letter of Credit may be increased or
         reduced (as the case may be) and the new face amount then required
         under this Section 10.11(b). The parties shall, thereafter, cooperate
         in amending the face amount of the Letter of Credit.

                  (c)      The parties acknowledge and agree that even if
Honeywell is required to maintain a Letter of Credit under Section 10.11(b),
Honeywell shall still be permitted to effect the Restructuring Transactions so
as to minimize the face amount of any Letter of Credit required to be maintained
by Honeywell pursuant to Section 10.11(b).

                  (d)      Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Honeywell may
effect any alternative structure or variation(s) of the Restructuring
Transactions that accomplishes the intent and purposes of Section 10.11(a);
PROVIDED that, prior to effecting any such alternative structure or
variation(s), Honeywell shall review and discuss such alternative structure or
variation(s) with Purchaser and Purchaser shall not have objected thereto (which
objection may not be made unless such structure or variation(s) is reasonably
expected to have an adverse impact on Purchaser) within five (5) business days
of Honeywell's initial notification to Purchaser of such alternative structure
or variation(s). To the extent Purchaser does not object to such alternative
structure or variation(s) within such time period, the parties shall cooperate
to take such actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to implement
any such alternative structure or variation(s), in lieu of the actions described
above.

                                       77
<PAGE>

                  (e)      Nothing contained in this Section 10.11 shall affect
Purchaser's rights to indemnification for any Excluded Liability, including the
Novar Guarantees or the Other New Guarantees.

                  (f)      The parties agree and acknowledge that the
Restructuring Transactions, if effected, shall result in Novar Investments (USA)
Inc., Novar Financial Inc. and Novar Holdco Inc. becoming Subsidiaries of
Honeywell and not the Company at Closing and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
representations and warranties of Honeywell concerning such entities shall not
be deemed inaccurate solely as a result the fact that such entities are no
longer Subsidiaries of the Company at Closing. For purposes of post-closing
administration of the Subsidiaries (such as confidentiality obligations, access
to and preservation of books and records and the like), such entities shall be
deemed Subsidiaries of Honeywell and not the Company if the Restructuring
Transactions are effected.

         10.12    CONSTRUCTION. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction
or interpretation. The language used in this Agreement is the language chosen by
the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party.

         10.13    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic .pdf submission),
and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement.
