numerator of which is a number equal to $9.04 _minus_ the cumulative amount
of Extraordinary Dividends per share declared or paid by Nova II prior to the
Nova II Merger Effective Time, and the denominator of which is equal to $9.04.

ARTICLE III

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

3.01  _Newco_ _to Make Merger Consideration Available_. Promptly after the
Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger Effective Time, Newco
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Constellation OP and reasonably acceptable to the Other
Parties (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , (a)
New Certificates to be issued pursuant to _Sections 2.08_ and _2.09_ and
exchanged pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_ for Old Certificates and (b)
cash in an amount sufficient to pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares
(such cash and any New Certificates described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_
and _(b)_ , together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Newco, _provided_ that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Nova I Merger
Consideration or Nova II Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable to
the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Newco.

 



\- 32 - 3.02 _Payment of Dividends_. Prior to the Applicable Effective Time, Nova I
and Nova II shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for further payment to holders prior to such time of Nova I Common
Stock or Nova II Common Stock, as applicable, an amount in cash, or units or
other securities of the Liquidating Trust (if any), equal to any dividend or
other distribution theretofore declared in respect of the Nova I Common Stock
or the Nova II Common Stock for any record date prior to the Applicable
Effective Time in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.01(e)_, including any
Extraordinary Dividend and any Distributing Party Special Dividend, that shall
not then have been paid to holders of Nova I Common Stock or Nova II Common
Stock, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Applicable Effective
Time occurs prior to any record date in respect of a dividend or other
distribution declared by the Nova I Board or the Nova II Board, no holder
shall have any right to any such dividend or other distribution in respect of
the Nova I Common Stock or the Nova II Common Stock, all such rights shall be
extinguished at the Applicable Effective Time and any such declared dividend
or other distribution shall no longer be due and payable. Any resolution of
the Nova I Board or the Nova II Board declaring a dividend shall provide for
the same.

3.03 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Applicable Effective Time, Newco
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Old Certificates in exchange for the applicable New Certificates and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares that the Nova I Common Stock or Nova II Common
Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement, as well as any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_. From and after the Applicable Effective Time,
upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
and duly executed letter of transmittal (or upon proper delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to book-entry shares), the holder of such Old
Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable: (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
shares of Newco Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of _Article II_ ; (ii) a check representing the amount of
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ ; and (iii) any dividends or
other distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or any dividends or other
distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Applicable Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
respect of dividends or other distributions as contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 3.03_.

 



\- 33 - (b) No dividends or other distributions authorized and declared with respect
to Newco Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in
accordance with this _Article III_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate
in accordance with this  _Article III_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, that following the Applicable Effective Time had become
payable with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock that the shares of
Nova I Common Stock or the applicable class of shares of Nova II Common Stock,
as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into
the right to receive. The surrender of an Old Certificate shall not impact a
holders right, to the extent applicable, to receive any declared but unpaid
dividends or other distributions on the shares of Nova I Common Stock or Nova
II Common Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate. 

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Newco Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Newco
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Applicable Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Nova I or Nova II of the shares of Nova I Common
Stock or Nova II Common Stock, as applicable, that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Applicable Effective Time. If, after the Applicable
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration and dividends or other distributions to which
the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled, as provided in this
_Article III_.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of Nova I or Nova II one (1) year after the Applicable
Effective Time shall be paid to Newco. Any former stockholders of Nova I or
Nova II who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Newco for payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration as well as dividends or other distributions
that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided
in this _Article III_ , and any unpaid dividends and other distributions on
the shares of Newco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Article II_ , in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Nova I Parties, the Nova II Parties, the Newco
Parties, Constellation OP, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former stockholder of Nova I or Nova II for any amount delivered
in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(f) Each of the parties and each of their Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.03_ or any consideration or amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and

 



\- 34 -  withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made.

 

(g) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Newco, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Newco may determine is reasonably necessary as an indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and dividends or other
distributions to which the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed is entitled, as provided in this _Article III_.

31, 2015 and 2016, and all other reports, registration statements, definitive
proxy statements or information statements filed by Nova I or any of the Nova
I Subsidiaries subsequent to January 1, 2015 under the Securities Act
or under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the form

SEC as of the date filed, (A) complied in all material respects as to form
with the applicable requirements under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (B) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the financial statements contained in or incorporated by
reference into any such Nova I SEC Document (including the related notes and
schedules, the " _Nova I Financial Statements_ ") (1) complied or will comply,
as the case may be, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto; (2) have been or will be, as the case may be,
prepared from, are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books and
records of Nova I and the Nova I Subsidiaries in all material respects; (3)
have been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial
statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments and as may be
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or like form
under the Exchange Act) in all material respects and (4) fairly presented in

schedules thereto) fairly presented in all material respects, the
consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and
changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of Nova I and the Nova I
Subsidiaries for the periods to which those statements relate, in each case
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved
(except in each case as may be noted therein, and subject to normal year-end

internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of Nova I.

 



\- 38 - (2) Nova I has made available to each of the Other Parties complete and
correct copies of all material written correspondence between the SEC, on one
hand, and Nova I, on the other hand, since January 1, 2015, other than as
publicly filed as correspondence in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval Database of the SEC.

(3) Since January 1, 2015, Nova I has designed and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and
includes those policies and procedures that: (A) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Nova I and its consolidated
Subsidiaries; (B) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Nova I Board; and (C)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Nova Is management has completed
an assessment of the effectiveness of Nova Is system of internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and, except as
set forth in the Nova I SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Since
January 1, 2015, Nova I (1) has designed and maintained disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Nova I in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Nova Is
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and (2) has not been subject to (A) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Nova Is ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information or (B) any fraud, whether or not material, involving
members of management who have a significant role in Nova Is internal control
over financial reporting.

 

(4) Neither Nova I nor any of the Nova I Subsidiaries has entered into or is
subject to (A) any "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item
303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) or (B)
any commitment to become party to any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary,
on one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,

 



\- 39 -  including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand, in each case where the results, purpose or
effect of such commitment or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Nova I or any Nova
I Subsidiary in Nova Is or such Subsidiarys published financial statements
or other Nova I SEC Documents.

with the Transactions, neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on, or disclosed in the notes to, the
consolidated financial statements of Nova I and the Nova I Subsidiaries,
other than as have not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to
result in, a Nova I Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to Nova Is Knowledge, threatened against Nova I or any Nova I
Subsidiary, nor is there any Order or arbitration outstanding against Nova I
or any Nova I Subsidiary, in each case, except for those that have not

(further Section 4.01(l) of the Nova I Disclosure Letter shall specifically
note if the consummation of the Transactions, absent a consent from the
counterparty to such Contract, results in a right of termination,
cancellation, acceleration or amendment of, triggers any payments or results
in any violation of or constitutes a breach or default of such Contract);

(3) Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary is in default, and to the
Knowledge of Nova I no other party is in default, under any Nova I Material
Contract to which it is a party, and there has not occurred any event that,

for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on
any Tax Return. Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary has received a
written claim, or to the Knowledge of Nova I, an unwritten claim, by any
authority in a jurisdiction where any of them does not file Tax Returns that
it is or may be subject to material Tax in that jurisdiction. Nova I and each

proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Nova I, threatened,
by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled,
except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been made or
with respect to which the failure to pay has not resulted in a Nova I
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary has waived
any statute of limitations with respect to material Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to any material Tax assessment or deficiency
for any open tax year (in each case other than in connection with any
extension of time to file any Tax Return). Neither Nova I nor any Nova I
Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law) with regard to material Taxes.

the meaning of Section 857(b)(6)(B)(iii) of the Code, as modified by Sections
857(b)(6)(C) and 857(b)(6)(D) of the Code. No event has occurred, and no

material Tax under Section 857(b)(6)(A) of the Code will be imposed on Nova I
or any Nova I Subsidiary.

 

(5) Nova I and each of the Nova I Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the

without having to comply with, any (A) procedure for payment of a material
deficiency or other post-Closing dividend for any taxable year, or (B)
provision for relief from any requirement of the Code which may be available
from the IRS on a discretionary basis or only upon the payment of a material
excise, penalty or similar Tax); and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take
any action if such action or omission, as the case may be, could reasonably be

contract or otherwise.

 



\- 44 - (13) Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary has been the
"distributing corporation" or "controlled corporation" (as such terms are
defined in Section 355 of the Code) with respect to a distribution of stock
described in or intended to qualify for tax-free treatment (in whole or in
part) under Section 355(a) of the Code or Section 361 of the Code (i) within
the two-year period ending as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) in a
distribution that otherwise constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of
related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(14) Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary is, will be (regardless of

internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Nova IIs ability to record,

(3) Neither Nova II nor any Nova II Subsidiary is in default, and to the
Knowledge of Nova II no other party is in default, under any Nova II Material

been settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been
made or with respect to which the failure to pay has not resulted in a Nova II
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Nova II nor any

 



\- 59 -  Nova II Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any material
Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year (in each case other than
in connection with any extension of time to file any Tax Return). Neither Nova

of its jurisdiction of formation and (ii) duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in all jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing
of property or assets or its conduct of business requires such Constellation

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, and (ii) is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing in all jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of

except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not
resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Power and Authority_. Each Constellation Party, each Contributed Entity
and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary has the corporate (or comparable)
power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
to own or lease all of its properties and assets. Each Constellation Party has
the corporate (or comparable) power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions to which such Constellation Party is a party.

 



\- 68 - (c) _Due Authorization and Execution_.

 

(1) Each Constellation Party has duly authorized, executed and delivered this
Agreement and has taken all corporate or limited liability company action
necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement. This Agreement, the

liability company action necessary on the part of each Constellation Party.
Assuming due execution by the Other Parties, this Agreement is a valid and
legally binding obligation of each Constellation Party, enforceable against

moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles).

Contributed Entity Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by Constellation OP or RED REIT of this Agreement or the
consummation by Constellation OP, RED REIT or any Contributed Entity
Subsidiary of the Transactions to which it is a party. As of the date hereof,

of any reason why the necessary Constellation Regulatory and Third Party
Approvals will not be received in order to permit consummation of the

\- 69 - (2) Subject to (i) receipt, filing or registration, as applicable,

the consummation by the Constellation Parties and the Contributed Entity
Subsidiaries of the Transactions to which either of them is a party, do not
and will not (A) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, or

material benefit payable or right of termination under, any applicable Law,
any Contract or other instrument or agreement of any Constellation Party, any
Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary or to which any
Constellation Party, any Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity
Subsidiary or any of their material, directly owned properties is subject
or bound ( _provided_ that Equity Interests in any person shall not be deemed
to be the properties or assets of any Constellation Party, any Contributed
Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary), (B) constitute a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of any
Constellation Party, any Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity

consent or approval that has not resulted in, and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _Contributed Entities_. 

(1) Section 4.03(e) of the Constellation OP Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all of the Contributed Entities, together
with (i) the jurisdiction of organization of each Contributed Entity, (ii) the
type of and percentage of voting, equity, profits, capital and other
beneficial interest held, directly or indirectly, by Constellation OP or RED
REIT, as applicable, in and to each Contributed Entity, (iii) the names of and
the type of and percentage of voting, equity, profits, capital and other

Entity.

 

(2) Constellation OP has previously made available to the Other Parties true
and correct copies of (i) all Organizational Documents of each Contributed
Entity and (ii) all documents effectuating the Pre-Signing Constellation
Internal Transfers.

 

(3) The documents effectuating the Pre-Signing Constellation Internal
Transfers are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, and are in full force and effect, except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at Law).

 



\- 70 - (f) _Financial Statements_. Attached as Section 4.03(f) of the Constellation
OP Disclosure Letter are copies of the following: (i) unaudited combined
balance sheets, combined statements of operations and comprehensive income and
combined statements of equity with respect to the Contributed Entities on an
aggregate basis, as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and
2015 (the " _Contributed Entity Annual Financial Statements_ "), (ii) the
unaudited combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and
consolidated statements of equity as of and for the six (6) months ended June
30, 2017 (the " _Contributed Entity Second Quarter Financial Statements_ "),
and (iii) any financial statements prepared and delivered for any other
reporting period subsequent to June 30, 2017, each of the financial statements
described in the foregoing clauses (i)(iii) unaudited and with any footnotes
in draft format only (the " _Contributed Entity Interim Financial
Statements,_ " and collectively with the Contributed Entity Annual Financial
Statements and Contributed Entity Second Quarter Financial Statements, the "
_Contributed Entity Financial Statements_ "). The Contributed Entity Financial
Statements (1) have been prepared from, are in accordance with and accurately
reflect the books and records of the Contributed Entities in all material
respects, (2) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the
absence of footnotes) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments)
in all material respects, and (3) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Contributed Entities as of the date of
such statement in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes)
consistently applied during the periods involved (except in each case as may
be noted therein, and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). It is
understood, however, that the Contributed Entities have not been operating
historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment and,
therefore, when the Contributed Entity Annual Financial Statements (including
footnotes) are audited (the " _Contributed Entity Audited Financial
Statements_ "), and the Contributed Entity Audited Financial Statements,
Contributed Entity Second Quarter Financial Statements (if applicable) and
Contributed Entity Interim Financial Statements are filed in connection with
the Form S-4, they will (A) with respect to the Contributed Entity
Audited Financial Statements, (i) contain an unqualified report from the
Contributed Entities independent registered public accountant(s) and (ii)
conform to the Contributed Entity Annual Financial Statements in all material
respects except for any material audit-related adjustments and corresponding
adjustments to footnotes; (B) with respect to the Contributed Entity Second
Quarter Financial Statements (if applicable) and Contributed Entity Interim
Financial Statements, conform to the Contributed Entity Audited Financial
Statements (except that such Contributed Entity Second Quarter Financial
Statements (if applicable) and Contributed Entity Interim Financial Statements
will not include year-end adjustments and footnote disclosures); (C) comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; (D) be prepared from, and be in accordance with and
accurately reflect the books and records of the Contributed Entities; (E) be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) in all
material respects and (F) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of each Contributed Entity as of the date of
such statement, and each of the statements of income and changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows or equivalent statements (including any
related notes and schedules thereto) fairly present in all material respects,
the consolidated results of 

 



\- 71 -  operations, changes in stockholders equity and changes in cash flows, as
the case may be, of each Contributed Entity for the periods to which those
statements relate, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved (except in each case as may be noted therein).

(g) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (i) as reflected or adequately
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheets included in the
Contributed Entity Second Quarter Financial Statements, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since March 31, 2017 and (iii) for liabilities and
obligations contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with the
Transactions, no Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has
any liabilities or obligations, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on, or disclosed in the notes to, the
Contributed Entity Financial Statements, other than as have not resulted in,
and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed Entity
Material Adverse Effect.

(h) _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Constellation OP, threatened against any
Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary, nor is there any
Order or arbitration outstanding against any Contributed Entity or any
Contributed Entity Subsidiary, in each case, except for those that have not
resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) _Compliance with Laws_. Each Contributed Entity and each Contributed
Entity Subsidiary:

 

(1) conducts, and since the later of (x) January 1, 2015 and (y) the date of
formation of such Contributed Entity has conducted, its business in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws;

(2) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and
has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental
Authorities that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties, if any, and to conduct its business as presently conducted,
except those the absence of which have not resulted in, and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse
Effect; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and
approvals are in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of the
Constellation Parties, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is
threatened, in each case, except as has not resulted in, and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse
Effect; and

(3) has not received, since the later of (x) January 1, 2015 and (y) the date
of formation of such Contributed Entity, any written notification from any
Governmental Authority (A) asserting that any Contributed Entity or any
Contributed Entity Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances that such Governmental Authority enforces or (B)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization of any Contributed Entity, in each case of  _clauses_ __ _
(A)_ and _(B)_ , except as has not resulted in, and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 72 - To the extent that a Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary
received certain Equity Interests or note receivable in connection with a
Pre-Signing Constellation Internal Transfer (or any earlier similar transfer
from a Constellation Affiliate), references in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.03(i)_
to a Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary shall also refer to
the entity that transferred such Equity Interests or note receivable, as the
case may be, to such Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary, but
only to the extent that any conduct covered by the representations contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 4.03(i)_ could reasonably be expected to result in
liability being ascribed to a Contributed Entity or a Contributed Entity
Subsidiary.

(j) _Material Contracts; Defaults_.

 

(1) Section 4.03(j)(1) of the Constellation OP Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of Contracts, including all amendments, supplements, exhibits and side
letters to any such Contract, to which each Contributed Entity or any
Contributed Entity Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound ( _provided_ that Equity Interests in any
person shall not be deemed to be the properties or assets of any Contributed
Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary), which, as of the date of this
Agreement:

 

(i) contains any non-compete or exclusivity provisions with respect to any
line of business or geographic area with respect to any Contributed Entity or
any Contributed Entity Subsidiary, or which restricts the conduct of any line

and the Contributed Entity Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

(ii) establishes a material partnership, joint venture or similar
arrangement;

(iii) relates to the borrowing of money from, or extension of credit to, a
third party, in each case having a principal amount of Indebtedness in excess

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (further
Section 4.03(j) of the Constellation OP Disclosure Letter shall specifically
note if the consummation of the Transactions, absent a consent from the
counterparty to such Contract, results in a right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration or amendment of, triggers any
payments or results in any violation of or constitutes a breach or default of
such Contract);

 

(iv) requires any Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary to
dispose of or acquire assets or properties with a fair market value in excess
of $50 million, or involves any pending or contemplated merger, consolidation

a Governmental Authority;

(vi) is the current allocation policy of Constellation (the "
_Allocation Policy_ ") as of the date hereof; or

(vii) is material to the Contributed Entities and the Contributed
Entity Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and contains any so-called "most
favored nations" or similar provisions requiring any Contributed Entity to
offer a person any terms or conditions that are at least as favorable as
those offered to any other person.

(2) Each Contract of the type described above in  _Section_ __ _ 4.03(j_
_)(_ _1)_ , and any Contributed Entity MBS Agreement, any Contract forming
part of the Contributed Entity Loan Files, any Contributed Entity PE
Investment Agreement or any Contributed Entity Major Lease, whether or not
set forth in Section 4.03(j) of the Constellation OP Disclosure Letter, is
referred to herein as a " _Contributed Entity Material Contract_." Except as
has not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a
Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect, each Contributed Entity Material
Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms
on each Contributed Entity and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary that is a
party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Constellation OP, each other party
thereto, and is in full force and effect, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at Law).

 

(3) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary is in default,
and to the Knowledge of Constellation OP no other party is in default, under
any Contributed Entity Material Contract to which it is a party, and there has
not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default, in each case, except as has not
resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect.

 

(4) Except as provided in Section 4.03(j)(1) of the Constellation OP
Disclosure Letter, Constellation OP has delivered or made available to each
of the Other Parties or provided to the Other Parties for review, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of all of the
Contributed Entity Material Contracts.

 

(5) To the extent that a Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary
received certain Equity Interests or note receivable in connection with a
Pre-Signing Constellation Internal Transfer (or any earlier similar transfer
from a Constellation Affiliate), references in _Section_ __ _ 4.03(j)(3)_ to
a Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary shall also refer to the
entity that transferred such equity interests or note receivable, as the case
may be, to such Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary, but only
to the extent that any conduct covered by the representations contained in
_Section_ __ _ 4.03(j)(3)_ could reasonably be expected to result in
liability being ascribed to a Contributed Entity or a Contributed Entity
Subsidiary.

 



\- 74 - (k) _Employees_. None of the Contributed Entities or any Contributed
Entity Subsidiaries have, or have ever had, any employees.

(l) _Taxes_.

 

(1) Each Contributed Entity and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary has timely
filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority all Tax Returns required to
be filed, taking into account any extension of time within which to file such
Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns are complete and correct, subject in
each case to such exceptions as have not resulted in, and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse
Effect. Each Contributed Entity and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary has
duly paid (or there has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate
provisions for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or
not shown on any Tax Return. No Constellation Party (in respect of the
Contributed Entities) nor any Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity
Subsidiary has received a written claim, or to the Knowledge of Constellation
OP, an unwritten claim, by any authority in a jurisdiction where any of them
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to material Tax in that
jurisdiction. Each Constellation Party (in respect of the Contributed
Entities), each Contributed Entity and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary have
established reserves in accordance with GAAP that are adequate for the payment
of all material Taxes not yet due and payable with respect to each of
them through the date of the most recent Contributed Entity Financial
Statements.

(2) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the Knowledge of Constellation OP threatened,
with regard to any material Taxes or material Tax Returns of any Contributed
Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary. No deficiency for Taxes of any
Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has been claimed,
proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Constellation OP,
threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been
settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been made or
with respect to which the failure to pay has not resulted in a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect. No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed
Entity Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
material Taxes, or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any
material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year (in each case
other than in connection with any extension of time to file any Tax Return).
No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has entered into
any "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law)
with regard to material Taxes.

 



\- 75 - (3) No Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary is or holds any
asset the disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar to)
Section 337(d) or Section 1374 of the Code or the regulations thereunder.

 

(4) Each Contributed Entity and each Contributed Entity Subsidiary has
complied, in all material respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and
regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 and
3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign Laws) and have duly
and timely withheld and have paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on
or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(5) There are no, and never have been any, Contributed Entity Tax Protection
Agreements in force or otherwise binding upon any Contributed Entity or
Contributed Entity Subsidiary.

(6) There are no material Tax Liens upon any property or assets of any
Contributed Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary except for Permitted
Liens with respect to such Contributed Entity.

 

(7) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has requested,
has received or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Authority
or has entered into any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with
respect to any material Taxes.

 

(8) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to, binding, or otherwise involving any Contributed Entity or
any Contributed Entity Subsidiary other than customary gross-up provisions of
any credit or similar commercial contract the primary purpose of which does
not relate to Taxes.

 

(9) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary (i) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Constellation) or (ii) has
any liability for material Taxes of any person (other than such Contributed
Entity or such Contributed Entity Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Laws),
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

 

(10) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has
participated in any "reportable transaction," within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) other than any loss transaction within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(5). 

 



\- 76 - (11) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary is, will
be (regardless of whether the Constellation OP Contribution or the RED REIT
Contribution, as applicable, occurs) or would be, as a result of the
Transactions, required to include material amounts in income, or exclude items
of deduction (in either case for Tax purposes), for any Tax period as a
result of (i) a change in method of Tax accounting or period; (ii) an
installment sale or "open transaction" disposition; (iii) a prepaid amount
received, accrued, or paid; (iv) deferred income or gain; (v) an election
under Section 108(i) of the Code; (vi) Section 481 of the Code, or, in the
case of each of the foregoing, any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Law; (vii) the recapture of any tax credit or other
special tax benefit; or (viii) the use of any special accounting method (such
as the long-term method for accounting for long-term contracts). No
Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary has pending a
transaction under Section 1031 or 1033 of the Code or other tax-deferral
transactions for which deferral will not be available as a result of the
Transactions.

(12) No written power of attorney that has been granted by any Contributed
Entity or any Contributed Entity Subsidiary is currently in force with
respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(13) No Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary directly or
indirectly (i) manages a lodging facility or a health care facility or (ii)
provides to any other person (under a franchise, license, or otherwise) rights
to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is
operated, in each case within the meaning of Section 856(l)(3) of the Code.

 

(14) No Contributed Entity owns any stock of Nova I or Nova II.

 

(15) Constellation OP and RED REIT are not "foreign persons" within the
meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code.

(m) _Mortgage Backed Securities_. Section 4.03(m) of the Constellation OP
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the mortgage backed securities owned
by a Contributed Entity or a Contributed Entity Subsidiary that have a net
book value of $10 million or more (collectively, the " _Contributed Entity
MBS_ "). A Contributed Entity or a Contributed Entity Subsidiary is the sole
owner of the Contributed Entity MBS, free and clear of any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens). Constellation OP has made available to each of the Other
Parties complete and correct copies of the Contributed Entity MBS, the
Contributed Entity Principal MBS Agreements and the related certificates and
other instruments evidencing ownership of the Contributed Entity MBS to the
extent that such foregoing documents are in Constellation OPs, RED REITs, a
Contributed Entitys or a Contributed Entity Subsidiarys possession, custody
or control. Except as has not resulted in, and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect,
no Contributed Entity nor any Contributed Entity Subsidiary (or the
applicable Affiliate of a Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary
that transferred Equity Interests or note receivable, as the case may be, to
such Contributed Entity or Contributed Entity Subsidiary in connection with a
Pre-Signing Constellation Internal Transfer or an earlier similar transfer
from a Constellation Affiliate) (1) is in default in the performance of any
of its obligations under any pooling and servicing agreements, trust and

 



\- 77 -  servicing agreements, trust agreements, servicing agreements or other
similar documents providing for the creation of the Contributed Entity MBS or
the servicing of the mortgage loans underlying the Contributed Entity MBS
(collectively, but only to the extent that a Contributed Entity or Contributed
Entity Subsidiary is a party to any of such foregoing agreements, the "
_Contributed Entity Principal MBS Agreements_ ") or (2) has received any
notice of any default by any master or special servicer of any Contributed
Entity MBS. There are no material agreements (other than the Contributed
Entity Principal MBS Agreements) between any Contributed Entity or
any Contributed Entity Subsidiary and the master or special servicer with
respect to any series of Contributed Entity MBS.

(n)  _Loans_.

(1) Section 4.03(n) of the Constellation OP Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the loans or participations in loans owned by a Contributed Entity or
a Contributed Entity Subsidiary that have a net book value of $25 million or
more (collectively, the " _Contributed Entity Loans_ "). A Contributed Entity
or a Contributed Entity Subsidiary is (x) the sole owner of the Contributed
Entity Loans and (y) the sole owner or beneficiary of or under any related
notes (collectively, the " _Contributed Entity Notes_ "), deeds of

(a) _Go Shop_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement but subject to _Sections 6.01(b)(3)_ ,  _(d)_ and _(e)_ , during
the period beginning on the date of the first public announcement of this
Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
that is thirty (30) days after the date of the first public announcement of
this Agreement (the " _Go Shop Period End Time_ "), Nova I, the Nova I

purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Nova I Go Shop Bidder_ " shall

 



\- 95 -  mean any person (including its controlled Affiliates and Representatives)
that submits a written proposal or offer regarding a Nova I Acquisition
Proposal prior to the Go Shop Period End Time that the Nova I Board Special
Committee determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors, prior to the Go Shop Period End Time
(or in the case of any Nova I Acquisition Proposal received fewer than five
(5) business days before the date of the Go Shop Period End Time, no later
than five (5) business days after the receipt of such Nova I Acquisition
Proposal), has resulted in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a Nova
I Superior Proposal.

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.

 

(1) Except with respect to a Nova I Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go Shop
Period End Time, Nova I shall, and shall cause the Nova I Subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, Affiliates and Representatives,
and shall direct each of its and the Nova I Subsidiaries other
Representatives (to the extent acting on behalf of Nova I) to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations

Representatives (to the extent acting on behalf of Nova I) not to, directly
or indirectly, (I) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers for, or engage in any negotiations concerning,
or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have
any discussions with, any person relating to any inquiry, proposal, offer or
other action that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Nova I Acquisition Proposal, (II) enter into or engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding or

Acquisition Proposal, (III) release any person from or fail to enforce any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation to Nova I or any of the
Nova I Subsidiaries, or (IV) approve, recommend or enter into any letter of
intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
contract or agreement in principle (whether binding or not) with respect
to, contemplating or otherwise relating to a Nova I Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Nova I shall be permitted to waive or to not
enforce any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
obligation to permit a person to make a confidential Nova I Acquisition
Proposal directly to the Nova I Board Special Committee if the Nova I Board
Special Committee determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that any such failure to waive or to not enforce would be
inconsistent with or otherwise result in a breach of the Nova I directors
duties under applicable Law. Upon the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova I shall,
and shall cause the Nova I Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, Affiliates and Representatives to: (1) withdraw and terminate access
that was granted to any person (other than any Nova I Go Shop Bidder and
the Other Parties and their

 



\- 96 -  respective Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual or physical) that
was established with respect to or in connection with any Nova I Acquisition
Proposal or potential Nova I Acquisition Proposal and (2) exercise and use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any contractual rights available to
Nova I to cause each person (other than any Nova I Go Shop Bidder and the
Other Parties and their respective Representatives) who received non-public
or confidential information of Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary to promptly
return to Nova I or destroy such information. For the avoidance of doubt,
after the Go Shop Period End Time and until the receipt of the Nova I
Requisite Vote, Nova I, the Nova I Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives may continue to take any of the actions described in _Section
6.01(a)_ with respect to any proposals or offers regarding any Nova I
Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Nova I Go Shop Bidder on or before the Go
Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or modified proposal or
offer with respect to any such Nova I Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Nova I Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if the Nova I Board
Special Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors that such Nova I Acquisition
Proposal (as may be amended or modified) is or is reasonably likely to lead to
a Nova I Superior Proposal; _provided_ that a Nova I Go Shop Bidder shall
cease to be a Nova I Go Shop Bidder if the negotiations between Nova I
and such Nova I Go Shop Bidder with respect to the Nova I Acquisition
Proposal that resulted in such Nova I Go Shop Bidder becoming a Nova I Go Shop
Bidder shall have been terminated.

 

(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to the time, but not after, the
Nova I Requisite Vote is obtained, Nova I and its Representatives may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a person or persons
who has made a written Nova I Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)(1)_ ( _provided_ that Nova I (x) receives
from the person or persons so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement (containing provisions limiting the use and
disclosure of non-public written and oral information furnished to such person
by or on behalf of Nova I at least as favorable to Nova I as the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement), and (y) as contemplated below, Nova I
discloses to the Other Parties (and provides copies to the Other Parties of)
such written Nova I Acquisition Proposal and concurrently furnishes, makes
available or provides access to any nonpublic information provided to such
person or persons to the extent not previously so provided to such Other
Party), and (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any person who has made such a written Nova I Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in _clause_ __ _
(A)_ or _(B)_ above, the Nova I Board Special Committee has either determined
that such Nova I Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Nova I Superior Proposal
or determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and
outside financial advisors that such Nova I Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Nova I Superior Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by the Representatives or Affiliates of Nova I or any Nova I
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ by
Nova I.

 



\- 97 - (3) As soon as is reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova I will

keep the Other Parties reasonably informed of all material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning any such Nova I Acquisition Proposal

Parties in writing if (A) any Nova I Acquisition Proposal is received by Nova
I, (B) any request for information relating to Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary
is received by Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary from any person who informs
Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made a
Nova I Acquisition Proposal or (C) any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated with Nova I regarding any Nova I Acquisition Proposal, in
each case from a person that is not a Nova I Go Shop Bidder, and shall, in any
such notice to the Other Parties, indicate the identity of the person making,
and the material terms and conditions of, such Nova I Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of
any written Nova I Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed transaction
agreement), and thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions
or negotiations or receipt of materials) (x) keep the Other Parties reasonably
informed of all material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning
any such Nova I Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (y) provide the
Other Parties with any written supplements or written additions to any written
Nova I Acquisition Proposal, including any revisions to any proposed
transaction agreement. Neither Nova I nor any Nova I Subsidiary will enter
into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits Nova I from providing any information to the Other Parties in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_.

 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as expressly provided in _Sections_
__ _ 6.01(d)_, _6.01(e)_ and  _8.03(d)_ , neither the Nova I Board, nor any
committee thereof, nor any group of directors, formally or informally, shall:

 

(1) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose or
announce or authorize or resolve to, or announce its intention to change,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to the
Other Parties, the Nova I Board Recommendation;

 



\- 98 - (2) authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or recommend
or propose to publicly authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt
or recommend, any Nova I Acquisition Proposal;

 

(3) authorize, cause or permit Nova I or any Nova I Subsidiary to enter into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement for any Nova I Acquisition Proposal; or

(4) fail to make the Nova I Board Recommendation or fail to include the Nova I
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses
(1), (2) or (4) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01(c)_ being referred to as a "
_Nova I Change of Recommendation_ ").

 

(d) _Nova I Change of Recommendation; Right to Terminate_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Nova I Requisite Vote
is obtained, and subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.01(d)_ in all material respects, if (i) Nova I receives a Nova I
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not from a Nova I Go Shop Bidder) that did
not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ (and such proposal is
not withdrawn) and the Nova I Board Special Committee determines that such
Nova I Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Nova I Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Nova I
Change of Recommendation in connection with such Nova I Superior Proposal
or that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement for such Nova I Superior Proposal would be inconsistent
with the Nova I directors duties under applicable Law, then the Nova I Board
(based on the recommendation of the Nova I Board Special Committee) may
effect a Nova I Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ or (ii) a Nova I Intervening Event
occurs, and the Nova I Board Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Nova I Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Nova I
directors duties under applicable Law, then the Nova I Board (based on the
recommendation of the Nova I Board Special Committee) may effect a Nova I
Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Nova I Board may
not take action contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) pursuant to the foregoing
unless:

(1) Nova I has provided written notice to the Other Parties of its intention
to take such action at least four (4) business days in advance of effecting a
Nova I Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement (unless at the
time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
four (4) business days prior to the Nova I Stockholders Meeting, in which
case Nova I will provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " _Nova I_ ___Notice Period_ ")),
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action
and, if such action is made in response to a Nova I Superior Proposal, such
prior written notice shall include a description of the material terms
of such Nova I Superior Proposal and a copy of the then existing draft of the
definitive agreement providing for such Nova I Superior Proposal and any then
existing drafts of the other relevant transaction agreements (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment, supplement or modification to the
terms of any Nova I Superior Proposal shall be

 



\- 99 -  deemed a new Nova I Superior Proposal and Nova I may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ or make a Nova I Change of
Recommendation unless Nova I has provided a new notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.01(d)(1)_, except that such new Nova I Notice Period in
connection with any such amendment, supplement or modification shall be for
two (2) business days from the time the Other Parties receive such notice (or
as much notice as is reasonably practicable if there are fewer than two (2)
business days prior to the Nova I Stockholders Meeting));

 

(2) if such action is made in response to a Nova I Superior Proposal, during
the Nova I Notice Period, Nova I has negotiated (and directed its outside
financial and outside legal advisors to negotiate) with the Other Parties in
good faith (to the extent the Other Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Nova I
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith determination of the
Nova I Board Special Committee, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and outside financial advisors) a Nova I Superior Proposal; and

 

(3) if such action is made in response to a Nova I Intervening Event, during
the Nova I Notice Period, Nova I has negotiated (and directed its outside
financial and outside legal advisors to negotiate) with the Other Parties in
good faith (to the extent the Other Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the
failure to effect a Nova I Change of Recommendation would not, in the good
faith determination of the Nova I Board Special Committee, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, be inconsistent with the Nova I directors duties
under applicable Law.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Nova I or the Nova I Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to a Nova I Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that, if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying, or does not expressly restate and publicly reaffirm, the
Nova I Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Nova I
Change of Recommendation.

6.02 _Nova II Acquisition Proposals_ _._

 

(a) _Go Shop_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement but subject to _Sections 6.02(b)(3)_ ,  _(d)_ and _(e)_ , during
the period beginning on the date of the first public announcement of this
Agreement and continuing until the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova II, the Nova
II Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may and shall have the
right to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or
facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers for, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to any inquiry,
proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Nova II Acquisition Proposal, including by way of
contacting third parties, broadly disseminating public disclosure or
providing access to the properties, offices, assets, books, records and
personnel of Nova II and the Nova II Subsidiaries and furnishing non-public 

 



\- 100 -  information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more executed
confidentiality agreements (containing provisions limiting the use and
disclosure of non-public written and oral information furnished to such
person by or on behalf of Nova II at least as favorable to Nova II as the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ , _ however_, that
Nova II has previously furnished, made available or provided access to such
nonpublic information to the Other Parties or concurrently does so; (ii) enter
into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding or otherwise in furtherance of any inquiry, proposal,
offer or other action that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, or otherwise to obtain, a Nova II Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any person from or fail to enforce any confidentiality, "standstill"
or similar obligation to Nova II or any of the Nova II Subsidiaries; and (iv)
disclose to the stockholders of Nova II any information required to be
disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
this clause (iv), if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying, or does not expressly restate and publicly reaffirm, the
Nova II Board Recommendation, then such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Nova II Change of Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Nova II Go Shop Bidder_ " shall mean any person (including its controlled
Affiliates and Representatives) that submits a written proposal or offer
regarding a Nova II Acquisition Proposal prior to the Go Shop Period End Time
that the Nova II Board Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors, prior
to the Go Shop Period End Time (or in the case of any Nova II Acquisition
Proposal received fewer than five (5) business days before the date of the Go
Shop Period End time, no later than five (5) business days after the receipt
of such Nova II Acquisition Proposal), has resulted in, or would be reasonably
likely to result in, a Nova II Superior Proposal.

 

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.

 

(1) Except with respect to a Nova II Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go
Shop Period End Time, Nova II shall, and shall cause the Nova II Subsidiaries
and its and their respective directors, officers, Affiliates and
Representatives, and shall direct each of its and the Nova II Subsidiaries
other Representatives (to the extent acting on behalf of Nova II)
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted theretofore with respect to any Nova II
Acquisition Proposal. Except with respect to a Nova II Go Shop Bidder, from
and after the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova II shall not, and shall cause the
Nova II Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates, and shall direct each of its and the Nova II Subsidiaries other
Representatives (to the extent acting on behalf of Nova II) not to, directly
or indirectly, (I) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers for, or engage in any negotiations concerning,
or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to any inquiry, proposal, offer or other
action that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Nova II
Acquisition Proposal, (II) enter into or engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding or otherwise in
furtherance of, or furnish to any other person any information in connection
with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal,
offer or other action that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, or otherwise to obtain, a Nova II Acquisition Proposal, (III) release
any person from or fail to enforce any

 



\- 101 -  confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation to Nova II or any of the
Nova II Subsidiaries, or (IV) approve, recommend or enter into any letter of
intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, arrangement,
understanding, contract or agreement in principle (whether binding or not)
with respect to, contemplating or otherwise relating to a Nova II Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Nova II shall be permitted to waive or
to not enforce any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
obligation to permit a person to make a confidential Nova II Acquisition
Proposal directly to the Nova II Board Special Committee if the Nova II Board
Special Committee determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors that any such failure to
waive or to not enforce would be inconsistent with or otherwise result in a
breach of the Nova II directors duties under applicable Law. Upon the Go Shop
Period End Time, Nova II shall, and shall cause the Nova II Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers, Affiliates and Representatives to: (1)
withdraw and terminate access that was granted to any person (other than any
Nova II Go Shop Bidder and the Other Parties and their respective
Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual or physical) that was
established with respect to or in connection with any Nova II Acquisition
Proposal or potential Nova II Acquisition Proposal and (2) exercise and use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any contractual rights available
to Nova II to cause each person (other than any Nova II Go Shop Bidder and the
Other Parties and their respective Representatives) who received non-public or
confidential information of Nova II or any Nova II Subsidiary to promptly
return to Nova II or destroy such information. For the avoidance of doubt,
after the Go Shop Period End Time and until the receipt of the Nova II
Requisite Vote, Nova II, the Nova II Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives may continue to take any of the actions described in _Section
6.02(a)_ with respect to any proposals or offers regarding any Nova II
Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Nova II Go Shop Bidder on or before the
Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or modified proposal or
offer with respect to any such Nova II Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Nova II Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if the Nova II Board
Special Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that such Nova II Acquisition Proposal (as may be amended or
modified) is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Nova II Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that a Nova II Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Nova II Go Shop
Bidder if the negotiations between Nova II and such Nova II Go Shop Bidder
with respect to the Nova II Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such
Nova II Go Shop Bidder becoming a Nova II Go Shop Bidder shall have been
terminated.

(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to the time, but not after, the
Nova II Requisite Vote is obtained, Nova II and its Representatives may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a person or persons
who has made a written Nova II Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)(1)_ ( _provided_ that Nova II (x) receives
from the person or persons so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement (containing provisions limiting the use and
disclosure of non-public written and oral information

 



\- 102 -  furnished to such person by or on behalf of Nova II at least as favorable to
Nova II as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement), and (y) as
contemplated below, Nova II discloses to the Other Parties (and provides
copies to the Other Parties of) such written Nova II Acquisition Proposal and
concurrently furnishes, makes available or provides access to any nonpublic
information provided to such person or persons to the extent not previously
so provided to such Other Party), and (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person who has made such a written Nova
II Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in each such
case referred to in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or _(B)_ above, the Nova II Board
Special Committee has either determined that such Nova II Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Nova II Superior Proposal or determined in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors
that such Nova II Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Nova II Superior Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Representatives or
Affiliates of Nova II or any Nova II Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ by Nova II.

 

(3) As soon as is reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova II will
notify the Other Parties in writing (i) if any Nova II Go Shop Bidders remain
at such time, (ii) of the identity of such Nova II Go Shop Bidder(s) and (iii)
concerning the material terms and conditions of the most recent Nova II
Acquisition Proposal received from such Nova II Go Shop Bidder(s) (and shall
include with such notice copies of any written Nova II Acquisition Proposal,
including any proposed transaction agreement), and thereafter shall promptly
(and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of
such developments, discussions or negotiations or receipt of materials) (x)
keep the Other Parties reasonably informed of all material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such Nova II
Acquisition Proposal and (y) provide the Other Parties with any written
supplements or written additions to any written Nova II Acquisition Proposal,
including any revisions to any proposed transaction agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time, Nova II
will promptly (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt thereof) notify the Other Parties in writing if (A) any Nova II
Acquisition Proposal is received by Nova II, (B) any request for information
relating to Nova II or any Nova II Subsidiary is received by Nova II or any
Nova II Subsidiary from any person who informs Nova II or any Nova II
Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made a Nova II Acquisition
Proposal or (C) any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
with Nova II regarding any Nova II Acquisition Proposal, in each case from a
person that is not a Nova II Go Shop Bidder, and shall, in any such notice to
the Other Parties, indicate the identity of the person making, and the
material terms and conditions of, such Nova II Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of any written Nova II
Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed transaction agreement), and
thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations
or receipt of materials) (x) keep the Other Parties reasonably informed of all
material developments, discussions and negotiations

 



\- 103 -  concerning any such Nova II Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (y)
provide the Other Parties with any written supplements or written additions to
any written Nova II Acquisition Proposal, including any revisions to any
proposed transaction agreement. Neither Nova II nor any Nova II Subsidiary
will enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits Nova II from providing any information to the Other
Parties in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

(c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as expressly provided in _Sections_
__ _ 6.02(d)_, _6.02(e)_ and _8.04(d)_ , neither the Nova II Board, nor any
committee thereof, nor any group of directors, formally or informally,
shall:

withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to the

(2) authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or recommend or
propose to publicly authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or
recommend, any Nova II Acquisition Proposal;

Proposal; or

(4) fail to make the Nova II Board Recommendation or fail to include the Nova
II Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (1), (2) or (4) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_ being referred to as
a " _Nova II Change of Recommendation_ ").

(d) _Nova II Change of Recommendation; Right to Terminate_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Nova II Requisite Vote is
obtained, and subject to compliance with the provisions of this  _Section_ __
_ 6.02(d)_ in all material respects, if (i) Nova II receives a Nova II
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not from a Nova I Go Shop Bidder) that did
not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ (and such proposal is
not withdrawn) and the Nova II Board Special Committee determines that such
Nova II Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Nova II Superior Proposal and,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Nova
II Change of Recommendation in connection with such Nova II Superior Proposal
or that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement for such Nova II Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the Nova II directors duties under applicable Law, then the
Nova II Board (based on the recommendation of the Nova II Board Special
Committee) may effect a Nova II Change of Recommendation and/or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.04(d)_ or (ii) a Nova II
Intervening Event occurs, and the Nova II Board Special Committee determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Nova II Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the Nova II directors duties under applicable Law, then the Nova II
Board (based on the recommendation of the Nova II Board Special Committee) may
effect a Nova II Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Nova II Board may not take action contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) pursuant
to the foregoing unless:

 



\- 104 - (1) Nova II has provided written notice to the Other Parties of its intention
to take such action at least four (4) business days in advance of effecting a
Nova II Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement (unless at the
time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
four (4) business days prior to the Nova II Stockholders Meeting, in which
case Nova II will provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " _Nova II Notice Period_ ")),
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action
and, if such action is made in response to a Nova II Superior Proposal, such
prior written notice shall include a description of the material terms of such
Nova II Superior Proposal and a copy of the then existing draft of the
definitive agreement providing for such Nova II Superior Proposal and any then
existing drafts of the other relevant transaction agreements (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment, supplement or modification to the
terms of any Nova II Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new Nova II Superior
Proposal and Nova II may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.04(d)_ or make a Nova II Change of Recommendation unless Nova II has
provided a new notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)(1)_, except
that such new Nova II Notice Period in connection with any such amendment,
supplement or modification shall be for two (2) business days from the time
the Other Parties receive such notice (or as much notice as is reasonably
practicable if there are less than two (2) business days prior to the Nova II
Stockholders Meeting));

 

(2) if such action is made in response to a Nova II Superior Proposal, during
the Nova II Notice Period, Nova II has negotiated (and directed its outside
financial and outside legal advisors to negotiate) with the Other Parties in
good faith (to the extent the Other Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Nova
II Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith determination of
the Nova II Board Special Committee, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors) a Nova II Superior Proposal; and

 

(3) if such action is made in response to a Nova II Intervening Event, during
the Nova II Notice Period, Nova II has negotiated (and directed its outside
financial and outside legal advisors to negotiate) with the Other Parties in
good faith (to the extent the Other Parties desire to negotiate) to make such

faith determination of the Nova II Board Special Committee, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, be inconsistent with the Nova II
directors duties under applicable Law.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Nova II or the Nova II Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to a Nova II Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that, if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying, or does not expressly restate and publicly reaffirm, the
Nova II Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Nova II
Change of Recommendation.

of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of
the Newco Common Stock issuable in connection with the Constellation OP

and each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. The

information and assistance as may be reasonably requested, necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of the parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
the applicable National Securities Exchange or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, including in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement. In
addition, each of Nova I, Nova II and Constellation OP will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) provide interim financial statements (including
footnotes) of Nova I and the Nova I Subsidiaries, Nova II and the Nova II
Subsidiaries or the Contributed Entities, as applicable, that are required by

each case, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Newco to prepare the
Form S-4. In addition to the preceding sentence and without limiting any
obligations thereunder, the Constellation Parties shall deliver to the Other
Parties the Contributed Entity Audited Financial Statements as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and except as required by applicable Law, no party
shall furnish any information that is the subject of any confidentiality
agreement with any third party ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party with respect to furnishing such information) or subject to any
attorney client privilege ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit the furnishing of such information
in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of privilege).

(c) If, at any time prior to receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote or the Nova
II Requisite Vote, any information relating to Nova I, Nova II, the
Contributed Entities, Newco or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by Nova I, Nova II, Constellation OP or Newco that, in the
reasonable judgment of Nova I, Nova II, Constellation OP or Newco, should be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the Other Parties, and the parties shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, as applicable and, to the extent required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to common stockholders of Nova I or Nova II. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under

information concerning or related to Nova I, its Affiliates or the Nova I
Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Nova I, any
information concerning or related to Nova II, its Affiliates or the Nova II
Stockholders Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Nova II, and any

6.05 _Preparation of the Form S-11; Listing Process_ _._

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Newco
shall prepare and file or submit with the SEC the Form S-11 with respect to
the registration of shares of Newco Class A Common Stock in connection with an
initial public offering by Newco (the " _IPO_ "). Newco shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to ensure that the Form S-11 complies in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or
Securities Act, (ii) to respond as promptly as practicable to SEC comments
received with respect to the Form S-11, (iii) if requested by Constellation OP
(and subject to the IPO/Listing Parameters), to have the Form S-11 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing, and (iv) if declared effective by the SEC, to keep the Form S-11
effective for so long as necessary to complete the IPO by Newco. Each of the
parties shall promptly furnish all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates, and the holders of its stock to Newco (including financial
statements required to be included in the Form S-11) and provide such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested or necessary in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-11. Newco shall promptly
notify the Other Parties upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-11, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the Other
Parties with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with
respect to the Form S-11 received from the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or submitting the Form S-11 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Newco
shall cooperate with and provide to the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider in
good faith including in such document or response any comments reasonably
proposed by the Other Parties. Newco also shall take any other action required
to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign
or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder, or the MGCL, as applicable, the rules of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc., and the rules of the applicable National
Securities Exchange in connection with the filing of the Form S-11.

(b) Constellation OP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
IPO on terms consistent with those terms that may be mutually agreed upon by
the Parties and set forth in Section 6.05(b) of the Constellation OP
Disclosure Letter (the " _IPO/Listing Parameters_ ") prior to the
Outside Date. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.05(e)_, as promptly as practicable
following receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and the Nova II Requisite Vote,
Newco shall file with or submit to the SEC a preliminary prospectus relating
to the IPO, in order to permit the commencement of a "road show" for the
initial public offering of Newco Class A Common Stock.

 

(c) If the terms of the IPO are within the IPO/Listing Parameters, then
Constellation OP may, in its discretion, pursue and consummate the IPO at any
time within six (6) months after the receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and
Nova II Requisite Vote. Constellation OP shall have the sole discretion to
determine if market conditions are favorable 

 



\- 109 -  for effecting the IPO; _provided_ that if Constellation OP desires to pursue
the IPO (i) after the date that is six (6) months following the later of the
receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and the receipt of the Nova II Requisite
Vote or (ii) on terms that are not consistent with the IPO/Listing Parameters,
then such decision as to whether to effect an IPO of Newco shall require the
prior approval of the Nova I Board Special Committee and the Nova II Board
Special Committee.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Constellation OP determines, in
its sole discretion, that market conditions are not favorable for an IPO, it
may, following receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and the Nova II Requisite
Vote, elect to proceed with a listing (without an initial public offering) of
the shares of Newco Class A Common Stock on a National Securities Exchange in
lieu of the IPO of Newco; _provided_ that such listing shall be within the
IPO/Listing Parameters; and _provided_ _further_ that Constellation OP shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such listing following such
determination. Each of the parties shall promptly furnish all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, and the holders of its stock to Newco and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested or necessary in
connection with the listing process. At any time during the six (6)-month
period following the later of the receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and the
receipt of the Nova II Requisite Vote, Constellation OP shall have the sole
discretion to determine when to pursue a listing of the Newco Class A Common
Stock within the IPO/Listing Parameters. If Constellation OP desires to pursue
a listing of the Newco Class A Common Stock (i) after the date that is six
(6) months following the later of the receipt of the Nova I Requisite Vote and
the receipt of the Nova II Requisite Vote or (ii) on terms that are not
consistent with the IPO/Listing Parameters, then such decision as to whether
to effect a listing of the Newco Class A Common Stock shall require the prior
approval of the Nova I Board Special Committee and the Nova II Board Special
Committee.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, nothing in this  _Article VI_ shall require
Constellation OP to cause Newco to file a preliminary prospectus with the SEC,
commence a "road show," or effect an IPO of Newco or a listing of the Newco
Class A Common Stock if Constellation OP determines, in its sole discretion,
that market conditions are not favorable to effect an IPO of Newco or a
listing of the Newco Class A Common Stock.

 

6.06 _Actions_ _._

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party
will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in
good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable under applicable Laws, so as to permit consummation of the
Constellation OP Contribution, the RED REIT Contribution and the Mergers
as promptly as practicable in accordance with this Agreement and otherwise to
enable consummation of the Transactions, and each will cooperate fully with,
and furnish information to, the Other Parties to those ends.

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.06(b) of the Disclosure Letter of each party, the
parties and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare as promptly as

and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Mergers (including
material Regulatory

 



\- 110 -  and Third Party Approvals) and the other Transactions and will make all
necessary filings in respect of the material Regulatory and Third Party
Approvals as soon as practicable. Each of the parties will have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
Other Parties with respect to, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, all written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Regulatory and Third Party Approvals. In addition, subject to Section 6.06(b)
of the Disclosure Letter of each party, each party shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents, approvals or waivers under any material Contract pursuant
to which the Transactions could give rise to a default or acceleration
(following the provision of any notice, passage of time or both) thereunder
and to take any further actions reasonably requested by any Other Party to
avoid any such default or acceleration. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
party will consult with the Other Parties with respect to obtaining all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate
the Transactions and each party will keep the Other Parties apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the Transactions.

 

(c) Each party will, upon request, furnish the Other Parties with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such Other Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries with or to
any third party or Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall make appropriate
filings with respect to the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof and take any and all other
actions reasonably necessary, including to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by
a Governmental Authority, to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, in each
case as soon as practicable.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private person, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), such party against whom the action or proceeding
has been brought (or that has Knowledge such action or proceeding has been
threatened), shall promptly notify the Other Parties thereof. The parties
shall reasonably cooperate and consult each other in good faith on
any material decisions in the defense of any Transaction Litigation and none
of the parties shall settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any such
Transaction Litigation without each of the Other Partys prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



\- 111 - 6.07 _Press Releases_. Each party will consult with the Other Parties
before issuing any press release or other written stockholder communication
with respect to the Constellation OP Contribution, the RED REIT Contribution,
the Mergers or the other Transactions or this Agreement and will not issue any
such stockholder communication or make any such public statement with respect
to the Constellation OP Contribution, the RED REIT Contribution, the Mergers
or the other Transactions or this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Other Parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; provided that a party may, without the prior written
consent of the Other Parties (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such communication or make such
public statement as may be required by applicable Law or securities exchange
rules; provided, further, that a party may, without the prior written consent
of the Other Parties, and without consultation, issue any communications
relating to a Nova I Acquisition Proposal or Nova II Acquisition Proposal, as
applicable; provided, further, that any such communication relating to a Nova
I Acquisition Proposal or Nova II Acquisition Proposal that does not
expressly restate and publicly reaffirm the Nova I Board Recommendation or
Nova II Board Recommendation, respectively, shall be a Nova I Change of
Recommendation or Nova II Change of Recommendation, as the case may be. The
parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate on a prompt basis to develop all public communications and make
appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the
Transactions as reasonably requested by the Other Parties. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ limits the obligations of
Nova I and Nova II under _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_,
respectively.

 

6.08 _Access; Information_ _._

 

(a) Each of the parties agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, it will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Other Parties, and the Other Parties
respective directors, officers, counsel, accountants and other authorized
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the
period from the date hereof until the Closing to the books, records
(including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors) and properties
and to such other information as the Other Parties may reasonably request and,
during such period, each party will furnish promptly to the Other Parties (1)
a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and (2) such other
information concerning the business and properties of it as any of the Other
Parties may reasonably request; _provided_ that the obligation of
Constellation OP and RED REIT hereunder shall be limited to the books,
records, properties and such other information to the extent relating solely
to the Contributed Entities. None of the parties will be required to afford
access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege
or contravene any binding agreement with any third party. The parties will use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

 

(b) Each party will, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries and
representatives to, hold any information that is nonpublic and
confidential in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



\- 112 - 6.09 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. Each party shall not, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries and representatives not to, take any action that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become
applicable to this Agreement, the Transactions, or grant any waiver under any
Takeover Law with respect to any Nova I Acquisition Proposal or Nova II
Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, or other transaction with a third party
or otherwise take any action to exempt any person from any Takeover Law or
similar restrictive provision of such partys Organizational Documents. If
any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Transactions, each of the
parties and the respective board of directors shall grant such approvals and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Law on the Transactions. After giving effect to the
First Nova I Charter Amendment and the Nova II Charter Amendment, no
dissenters, appraisal or similar rights are available to the holders of Nova
I Common Stock or Nova II Common Stock with respect to the REIT Mergers and
the other Transactions.

6.10 _Indemnification_ _._

 

(a) From and after the Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger
Effective Time, Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (and Newco shall also advance reasonable
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director
or officer of Nova I and Nova II and each of their respective Subsidiaries, in
each case, when such individual is acting in such capacity (collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ " and each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Applicable Effective Time, including
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, arising out of or
pertaining to the REIT Mergers or the other Transactions.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger Effective Time,
Newco shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Newco
Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification
(including advancement of expenses) of any Indemnified Parties in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties,
it being the intent of the parties that the Indemnified Parties shall continue
to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification (including advancement
of expenses) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_. Newco shall, and shall cause the Newco
Subsidiaries to, honor and perform under all indemnification obligations owed
to any of the Indemnified Parties.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section_ __
_ 6.10(a)_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Newco thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Newco of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party (and only to the extent of such prejudice). In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the

 



\- 113 -  Applicable Effective Time), (1) Newco shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof, and Newco shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Newco elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties and advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of
interest between Newco and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Newco shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Newco shall
be obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use
of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels necessary
to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (2) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (3) Newco shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
_provided_ ___further_ that Newco shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

(d) Prior to Closing, Newco shall obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Nova Is and Nova
IIs current insurance carriers with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
Nova Is and Nova IIs existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Applicable Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). If Newco fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger Effective Time, Newco
shall maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Nova I Merger Effective Time and the Nova II Merger Effective Time the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement, with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in Nova Is and Nova IIs
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or Newco shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six (6)-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable
as provided in Newcos existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) If Newco or any of its successors or assigns (1) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (2) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Newco shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10._

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(g) The rights of each of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have
under the Organizational Documents of Nova I, Nova II, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Laws.

 



\- 114 - 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Nova I Parties shall give
prompt notice to the Other Parties of any fact, event or circumstance known

in, a Nova I Material Adverse Effect, or (b) would cause or constitute a

management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company and the
Subsidiaries hereunder, the members of which team shall devote such portion
of their time to the management of the Company and the Subsidiaries as is

their respective investment professionals in order to support the day-to-day
operations of the Company.

(b) Subject to the terms of the Investment Allocation Policy, none of

refrain from directly or indirectly:

 

(i) engaging in any business opportunity, including business opportunities in
the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which the
Company or any of its Affiliates may, from time to time, be engaged or propose
to engage (a " _Business Opportunity_ "), including (x) investing in, or
rendering advisory services to others investing in, any type of business
(including investments that meet the principal investment objectives of the
Company), whether or not the investment objectives or policies of any such
other Person are similar to those of the Company, including the
sponsoring, branding, advising and/or managing of any Other Constellation
Funds that employ investment objectives or strategies that overlap, in whole
or in part, with the Investment Guidelines of the Company, (y) __ buying,
selling or trading any securities or investments for their own accounts or
for the account of others for whom Constellation or any of its Affiliates,
including the Manager, or any of its or their officers, directors, employees
or personnel may be acting, and (z) __ receiving fees or other compensation
or profits from such activities described in this _Section 3(b)(i)_, which

(ii) competing with the Company, and none of Constellation or any of its
Affiliates, including the Manager, shall be liable to the Company for breach
of any duty (statutory, contractual or otherwise (other than for breach by
Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the Manager, of any express
restrictions on competition contained in any written contract
between Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the Manager, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand)) by reason of the fact
Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the Manager, engages in any
such activities, and the doctrine

 



18  of corporate opportunity or any similar doctrine applicable to the Company
shall not apply to Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the
Manager. The Company hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or in
being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Business Opportunity
presented to Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the Manager,
unless such Business Opportunity is offered to an Affiliate of Constellation
who is a director or officer of the Company and such Business Opportunity is
expressly offered to such director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company (a "Protected Opportunity"). Except for a
Protected Opportunity, in the event that Constellation or any of its
Affiliates, including the Manager, acquires knowledge of a Business
Opportunity, Constellation or its applicable Affiliate, as the case may be,
shall have no duty to communicate or offer such Business Opportunity to the
Company or any of its Affiliates and shall not be liable to the Company by
reason of the fact that Constellation or any of its Affiliates, including the
Manager, pursues or acquires such Business Opportunity for itself, directs
such Business Opportunity to another Person, or does not present such
opportunity to the Company or its subsidiaries.

 

(c) While information and recommendations supplied to the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall, in the Managers reasonable and good faith judgment, be
appropriate under the circumstances and in light of the investment objectives
and policies of the Company, such information and recommendations may be
different in certain material respects from the information and
recommendations supplied by the Manager or any Affiliate of the Manager to
others (including, for greater certainty, the Other Constellation Funds and
their investors, including Other Constellation Funds in which the Manager or
its Affiliates may have a beneficial interest, as described more fully in
_Section 3(d)_). The Manager and the Company acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) __ Affiliates
of the Manager sponsor, brand, advise and/or manage one or more Other
Constellation Funds and may in the future sponsor, brand, advise and/or manage
additional Other Constellation Funds, (ii) __ the Manager will allocate
investment opportunities that overlap with the Investment Guidelines of the
Company and such Other Constellation Funds in accordance with the Investment
Allocation Policy, to the extent applicable, and (iii) __ nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company and the Subsidiaries from entering into
transactions that constitute co-investments with Other Constellation Funds;
_provided_ that any such transaction described in this _clause (iii)_ __ is
(1) permitted pursuant to the Investment Guidelines or (2) __ receives or
has received the prior approval of the Board of Directors (including a
majority of the Independent Directors). The Investment Allocation Policy may
not be materially amended in any manner that is reasonably likely to
be adverse to the Company, unless such amendment has been approved by a
majority of the Independent Directors.

(d) In connection with the services of the Manager hereunder, the Company
acknowledges and/or agrees that (i) as part of Constellations regular
businesses, personnel of the Manager and its Affiliates may from time-to-
time work on other projects and matters (including

 



19  with respect to one or more Other Constellation Funds), and that conflicts
may arise with respect to the allocation of personnel between the Company and
the Subsidiaries and one or more Other Constellation Funds and/or the Manager
and such other Affiliates, (ii) there may be circumstances where investments
that are consistent with the Companys Investment Guidelines may be shared
with or allocated to one or more Other Constellation Funds (in lieu of the
Company and the Subsidiaries) in accordance with the Investment Allocation
Policy, to the extent applicable, (iii) __ the Manager and its Affiliates may
from time-to-time receive fees from portfolio entities or other issuers for
the arranging, underwriting, syndication or refinancing of investments or
other additional fees, including acquisition fees, loan servicing fees,
special servicing fees and administrative fees and fees or advisory or asset
management fees, including with respect to Other Constellation Funds and
related portfolio entities, and while such fees may give rise to conflicts of
interest, the Company and the Subsidiaries will not receive the benefit of any
such fees, and (iv) __ the terms and conditions of the Governing Instruments
of such Other Constellation Funds (including with respect to the economic,
reporting and other rights afforded to investors in such Other Constellation
Funds) are materially different from the terms and conditions applicable to
the Company and the Subsidiaries and their respective equityholders, and none
of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any such equityholders (in such capacity)
shall have the right to receive the benefit of any such different terms
applicable to investors in such Other Constellation Funds as a result of an
investment in the Company or the Subsidiaries or otherwise.

 

(e) Where investments that are consistent with the Companys Investment
Guidelines are shared with one or more Other Constellation Funds, the Manager
may, but is not obligated to, aggregate sales and purchase orders of
securities and other investments of the Company and the Subsidiaries with
similar orders being made simultaneously for such Other Constellation Funds,
if in the Managers judgment, such aggregation is likely to result generally
in an overall economic benefit to the Company and the Subsidiaries. The
determination of such economic benefit to the Company and the Subsidiaries by
the Manager is subjective and represents the Managers evaluation that the
Company and the Subsidiaries are benefited by relatively better purchase or
sales prices, lower commission expenses, increased access to investment
opportunities, beneficial timing of transactions or a combination of these
and other factors.

(f) Managers, partners, officers, employees, personnel and agents of the
Manager or Affiliates of the Manager may serve as directors, officers,
employees, partners, personnel, agents, nominees or signatories for the
Company and/or any Subsidiary, to the extent permitted by their Governing
Instruments or by any resolutions duly adopted by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Companys Governing Instruments. When executing documents or
otherwise acting in such capacities for the Company or the Subsidiaries, such
persons shall use their respective titles in the Company or the Subsidiaries.

 



20 (g) Subject to _Section 2(d)_, the Manager is authorized, for and on behalf
of the Company, and at the sole cost and expense of Operating Company or its
designee(s), to employ securities dealers for the purchase and sale of
Investments as the Manager deems necessary or appropriate, in its sole
discretion.

 

(h) The Company agrees to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably
required to permit and enable the Manager to carry out its duties and
obligations under this Agreement, including all steps reasonably necessary to
allow the Manager to make any filing or application, or provide any notice,
required to be made or provided under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, Code,
or other applicable law, rule or regulation, including the rules and
regulations of the applicable National Securities Exchange on which the Common
Stock is listed, on behalf of the Company in a timely manner. The Company
further agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to
the Manager all resources, information and materials reasonably requested by
the Manager to enable the Manager to satisfy its obligations hereunder,
including its obligations to deliver financial statements and any other
information or reports with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary.

(i) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to _Section 14(a)_, for two (2) __ years after such termination of this
Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause any
successor to the Manager not to, without the consent of the Manager, employ
or otherwise retain any employee of the Manager or any of its Affiliates or
any person who has been employed by the Manager or any of its Affiliates at
any time within the two (2)-year period immediately preceding the date on
which such person commences employment with or is otherwise retained by the
Company, a Subsidiary or any successor to the Manager. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to any damages, the Manager may be
entitled to equitable relief for any violation of this _Section 3(i)_ by the
Company, the Subsidiaries or any successor to the Manager, including
injunctive relief.

 

Section 4\. _Agency_. The Manager shall act as agent of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in making, acquiring, financing and disposing of Investments,
disbursing and collecting the funds of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
paying the debts and fulfilling the obligations of the Company and the

on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries and handling, prosecuting and
settling any claims of or against the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Board
of Directors, holders of the Companys securities or representatives or assets
of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

Section 5\. _Bank Accounts_. At the direction of the Board of Directors, the
Manager may establish and maintain as an agent on behalf of the Company, one
or more bank accounts in the name of the Company or any Subsidiary (any such
account, a " _Company Account_ "), and may collect and deposit funds into any
such Company Account or Company Accounts, and disburse funds from any such
Company Account or Company Accounts, under such terms and conditions as the
Board of Directors may approve; and the Manager from time to time render
appropriate accountings of such collections and payments to the Board of
Directors and, upon request, to the auditors of the Company or any Subsidiary.

 



21 Section 6\. _Records; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Manager shall maintain appropriate books of accounts and records
relating to services performed under this Agreement, and such books
of account and records shall be accessible for inspection by representatives

(b) The Manager shall keep confidential any and all confidential, proprietary
or non-public information of or concerning the performance, terms, business,

undertaking of confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use, disclosure or
presentations to investors of the Company or Constellation; (vii) __
to existing or prospective investors in Other Constellation Funds and their

Agreement, (C) __ was already in the possession of the Manager prior to the
time it was received by the Manager from the Company or its Affiliates, (D) __
was obtained by the Manager from a third party and, to the Managers
knowledge, was not disclosed in breach of an obligation of such third party
not to disclose such information, or (E) __ was developed independently by
the Manager without using or referring to any of the Confidential Information.
The provisions of this  _Section 6(b)_ shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) __ year.

 

Section 7\. _Obligations of Manager; Restrictions_.

 

(a) The Manager shall require each seller or transferor of Investments to the
Company and the Subsidiaries to make such representations and warranties
regarding such assets as may, in the judgment of the Manager, be necessary and
appropriate. In addition, the Manager shall take such other action as it deems
necessary or appropriate with regard to the protection of the Investments.

 

(b) The Manager shall refrain from any action that, in its sole judgment made
in good faith:

 

(i) is not in compliance with the Investment Guidelines;

 

(ii) would adversely and materially affect the qualification of the Company as
a REIT under the Code;

 

(iii) would adversely and materially affect the Companys or any Subsidiarys
status as an entity intended to be exempted or excluded from registration
under the Investment Company Act; or

(iv) would violate any law, rule or regulation of any governmental body or
agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or that would
otherwise not be permitted by the Companys Governing Instruments, code of
conduct or other compliance or governance policies and procedures or those of
the applicable National Securities Exchange on which the Common Stock is
listed.

If the Manager is ordered to take any such action by the Board of Directors,
the Manager shall promptly notify the Board of Directors if it is the
Managers judgment that such action would adversely and materially affect the
qualification of the Company as a REIT, the Companys or any Subsidiarys
status as an entity intended to be exempted or excluded from registration
under the Investment Company Act, or violate any such law, rule or regulation
or the Governing Instruments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager and
its officers, directors, members, managers and employees shall not be liable
to the Company or any Subsidiary or to any director or stockholder of the
Company or any Subsidiary for acts or omissions performed in accordance with
and pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 13_ of
this Agreement.

 



23 (c) The Board of Directors may periodically review the Investment Guidelines
and the Companys and the Subsidiaries portfolio of Investments, but will
not review each proposed investment; _provided_ that the Manager shall not
consummate on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary any transaction (other
than a transaction that constitutes a co-investment, which is addressed in
_Section 3(c)(iii)_ above) that involves (i) __ the sale of any investment
to, (ii) __ the acquisition of any investment from, (iii) __ investing in,
(iv) __ merging with, (v) __ arranging financing from, or (vi) __ providing
financing to, Constellation, any Other Constellation Fund or any of their
Affiliates, unless such transaction (A) __ is on terms no more favorable to
Constellation, any Other Constellation Fund or any of their Affiliates than
would be obtained from a third party on an arms length basis and (B) __ has
been approved by a majority of the Independent Directors. In connection with
the foregoing, it is understood and/or agreed for greater certainty that,
while conflicts of interests may arise from time-to-time in connection with
the investment activities of the Company, Constellation and the Other
Constellation Funds (including as more fully described in _Sections 3(c)_ __
and _3(d)_ above) and the Manager will seek to resolve any such conflicts of
interest in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with the Investment
Allocation Policy, to the extent applicable, and its prevailing policies and
procedures with respect to conflicts resolution among Other Constellation
Funds generally, there can be no assurance that any such conflicts will be
resolved in favor of the Company and the Subsidiaries and only those
transactions set forth above shall be required to be presented for approval by
the Independent Directors; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit the
ability of the Manager, in its discretion, to present additional matters
involving the Company and/or the Subsidiaries to the Independent Directors
from time-to-time for review, advice and/or approval to the extent the Manager
reasonably determines that doing so is appropriate under the circumstances
(including as a result of a determination that such matters give rise to
material conflicts of interest that are appropriate to be reviewed and/or
approved by the Independent Directors); _provided_   _further_ that if (x) __
the majority of the Independent Directors approve any matter or transaction
presented for their approval despite a conflict of interest after the Manager
has disclosed all material facts relating to such conflict of interest or (y)
__ the Manager acts in a manner, or pursuant to standards or procedures,
approved by a majority of the Independent Directors with respect to such
conflicts of interest that arise or may arise from time to time, then the
Manager shall not have any liability to the Company, the Subsidiaries or any
of their respective equityholders by reason of such conflict of interest for
actions in respect of such matter taken in good faith by any of them,
including actions in the pursuit of their own interests. If a majority of the
Independent Directors determine in their periodic review of transactions that
a particular transaction does not comply with the Investment Guidelines, then
a majority of the Independent Directors will consider what corrective action,
if any, can be taken. The Manager shall be permitted to rely upon the
direction of the Secretary of the Company to evidence the approval of the
Board of Directors or the Independent Directors with respect to a proposed
investment.

 



24 (d) The Manager agrees to be bound by all policies and procedures, including
the Companys code of conduct and other compliance and governance policies
and procedures, applicable to the Manager and its officers, directors,
members, managers and employees that are adopted by the Board of Directors
from time to time, including those required under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, or by the applicable National Securities Exchange on which the
Common Stock is listed, and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
reasonably required to cause its officers, directors, members, managers and
employees, and any principals, officers or employees of its Affiliates
(including Constellation) who are involved in the business and affairs of the
Company, to be bound by such policies and procedures to the extent applicable
to such Persons.

(e) The Manager shall at all times during the term of this Agreement maintain
"errors and omissions" insurance coverage and other insurance coverage that
is customarily carried by asset and investment managers performing functions
similar to those of the Manager under this Agreement with respect to assets
similar to the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in an amount which
is comparable to that customarily maintained by other managers or servicers of
similar assets.

such initial and final quarter, respectively, that this Agreement was in

the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or the Investments.

 

(b) The Manager shall compute each installment of the Base Management Fee
within thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar quarter with respect to
which such installment is payable. A copy of the computations made by the
Manager to calculate such installment of the Base Management Fee shall
thereafter promptly be delivered to the Board of Directors and, upon such
delivery, payment of such installment of the Base Management Fee shown
therein shall, subject in any event to _Section 14(a)_ of this Agreement, be
due and payable in cash no later than the date that is five (5) __ Business
Days after the date of delivery to the Board of Directors of such

the Manager to calculate such installment shall thereafter promptly be
delivered to the Board of Directors and, upon such delivery, payment of such
installment of the Incentive Fee shown therein shall be due and payable no
later than the date which is five (5) __ Business Days after the date of
delivery to the Board of Directors of such computations.

Section 10\. _Other Compensation Matters_. As a component of the Managers
compensation, the Company or any Subsidiary may issue to the Manager or
personnel of the Manager stock-based or other equity-based compensation under
the Companys or any such Subsidiarys equity incentive plan.

Section 11\. _Expenses of the Company_.

 

(a) Operating Company or its designee(s) shall pay all of the expenses of the
Company Parties and shall reimburse the Manager for documented expenses of
the Manager incurred on behalf of the Company Parties (collectively, the "
_Expenses_ ") excepting only those expenses that are specifically the
responsibility of the Manager pursuant to _Section 2_ of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Manager shall
have the right to cause any services contemplated by this Agreement (including
pursuant to _Sections 2(d)_ and _2(f)_ ) to be rendered by the Managers
personnel or Affiliates (and Operating Company or its designee(s) shall pay or
reimburse the Manager or its applicable Affiliate performing such services for
the documented cost thereof); _provided_ that such services may be provided

Manager in connection with assets acquired by or services rendered to the
Company together with any Other Constellation Funds, Operating Company or its
designee(s) shall only be responsible for the Company Parties pro rata share
of such expenses, based on the ratio of the amount of capital contributed by
the Company Parties for any investment in such assets compared to the total
capital invested in such assets.

and the Subsidiaries pro rata portion of rent, telephone, utilities, office

expenses of the Manager and its Affiliates required for the operations of the

Manager, on the one hand, and the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, based on the ratio of the Companys and the Subsidiaries proportion of
gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed or held
by Constellation and its Affiliates, including the Manager, as calculated at
each quarter end. The Manager and the Company will modify this allocation
methodology, subject to the Independent Directors approval, if the allocation
becomes inequitable ( _i.e_., if the Company and the Subsidiaries become
highly leveraged compared to Constellation or the Other Constellation Funds).
Operating Company or its designee(s) will also be required to pay the rent for
office space and other office, internal and overhead expenses incurred by
persons who are employed directly by the Company or the Subsidiaries and who
are not simultaneously employed by the Manager or any of its Affiliates.

 

(c) The Manager may, at its option, elect not to seek reimbursement for
certain expenses during a given quarterly period, which determination shall
not be deemed to constitute a waiver of reimbursement for similar expenses in
future periods.

 



29 (d) The provisions of this _Section 11_ shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement to the extent such expenses have
previously been incurred or are incurred in connection with such expiration or
termination.

 

Section 12\. _Calculations of Expenses_. The Manager shall prepare a written
statement documenting in reasonable detail the Expenses during each calendar
quarter, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such
statement to the Company within thirty (30) days after the end of each
calendar quarter (subject to reasonable delays resulting from delays in
the receipt of information). Expenses shall be reimbursed by Operating
Company or its designee(s) to the Manager no later than the fifteenth (15th)
Business Day immediately following the date of delivery of such statement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such reimbursements may be offset by the
Manager against amounts due to the Company and the Subsidiaries from the
Manager. The provisions of this _Section 12_ shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 13\. _Limits of the Manager s Responsibility; Indemnification_.

extent permitted by law, the Manager and its Affiliates, including their
respective directors, members, officers, managers, employees, trustees,

process or in the trade process), performed in accordance with and pursuant to
this Agreement, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
veil, principles of fiduciary duty and agency, by or through a claim, by the
enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable

damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature whatsoever,
including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred

with the business and operations of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
action taken or omitted by any such Manager Covered Person in good faith by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to authority granted by
this

 



30  Agreement, except where found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
attributable to the gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith
of any such Manager Covered Person or the reckless disregard by such Manager
Covered Person of their duties under this Agreement. In the event that any
Manager Covered Person becomes involved in any capacity in any suit, action,
proceeding or investigation in connection with any matter arising out of or
in connection with the Managers duties hereunder, the Company will
periodically reimburse such Manager Covered Person for its reasonable legal
and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation) incurred in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to any such advancement of expenses (i) such Manager Covered Person
shall provide the Company with an undertaking to promptly repay to the Company
the amount of any such expenses paid to it if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Manager Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Company as herein provided in connection with such suit, action,
proceeding or investigation, and (ii) __ such Manager Covered Person shall
provide the Company with a written affirmation that such Manager Covered
Person in good faith believes that it has met the standard of conduct
necessary for indemnification hereunder;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that the failure for any reason of the Company to advance funds to any
Manager Covered Person shall in no way affect such Manager Covered Persons
right to reimbursement of such costs if it is ultimately determined that such
Manager Covered Person was entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms
hereof.

(c) The Manager, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, Operating Company and any other Subsidiary,
including their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees,
stockholders, partners, trustees, control persons and equityholders (each, a
" _Company Covered Person_ "; a Manager Covered Person and a Company Covered
Person are each sometimes hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_
") of and from any and all Losses in respect of, arising out of or in
connection with (i) any action taken or omitted by the Manager that is found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute gross negligence, fraud,
willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of the Managers duties
under this Agreement or (ii) __ any claims by the Managers employees
relating to the terms and conditions of their employment by the Manager.

 

(d) An Indemnified Party will promptly notify the party from whom
indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section 13(b)_ or  _13(c)_ , as
applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of the occurrence of any action,
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ") likely to result in
an indemnification request pursuant hereto and shall describe the nature of
the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure by such Indemnified Party
to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure shall have
actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Partys ability to eliminate or reduce
any liability or the defense of such action. Each Indemnified Party hereby
undertakes, and the Indemnifying Party hereby accepts each
Indemnified Partys undertaking, to repay any and all such amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified therefor. The Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to take control, at its own cost, in the defense of said Claim,
including the selection of counsel, in the

 



31  Indemnifying Partys sole discretion. In such a case, the Indemnified Party
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with all necessary information and shall
consult with the Indemnified Party on the conduct of its defense. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and the use of
reasonable efforts to make employees available to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Should the
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a third-party claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to any Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, unless the third-party claim involves potential conflicts
of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that
the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. No Indemnified Party shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to any
pending or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification can be sought
under this Agreement without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent,
in its sole discretion. The Indemnifying Party shall accept no liability or
settlement in the context of Claims the consequences of which would be likely
to give rise to indemnification pursuant hereto, without the prior written
consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, unless such settlement
agreement includes a full and unreserved clause of exclusion of liability of
any Indemnified Party in the context of such dispute.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this _Section 13_ to the contrary, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) __ each Indemnified Party must use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all other sources of
indemnification, advancement, insurance and contribution it has against third
parties, including portfolio companies (or any legal entity in which the
Indemnifying Party holds an investment), with respect to the amounts to which
it is entitled under this  _Section 13_, (ii) any such third party,
including any portfolio company (or any other legal entity in which the
Indemnifying Party holds an investment), shall be the indemnitor of first
resort and any obligation of the Indemnifying Party to provide payments under
this _Section 13_ for amounts to which an Indemnified Party is entitled are
secondary, (iii) __ if the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid any
amounts under this _Section 13_ that should have been paid by a third party,
including any portfolio company (or any legal entity in which the Indemnifying
Party holds an investment), then (A) __ the Indemnifying Party shall be fully
subrogated to the rights of such Indemnified Party with respect to such
payment, (B) __ such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party
all of such Indemnified Partys rights to advancement, indemnification and
contribution from or with respect to such third party, including any
portfolio company (or any legal entity in which the Indemnifying Party holds
an investment), and (C) __ such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) in its efforts
to recover such payments through indemnification or otherwise, including
filing a claim against such third party in the name of the Indemnified Party,
(iv) __ the Indemnified Party will not agree to subordinate or
otherwise compromise or release

 



32  indemnity from a third party, including any portfolio company (or any legal
entity in which the Indemnifying Party holds an investment) and (v) in the
event the Indemnifying Party has previously provided separate indemnification
or advancement in connection therewith, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse
the Indemnifying Party with any subsequent proceeds it receives from such
third parties, including portfolio companies (or other legal entities in
which the Indemnifying Party holds an investment). The intent of this _Section
13(e)_ is to set forth the relative responsibilities of the Indemnifying Party
and other third parties, including portfolio companies (or other legal
entities in which the Indemnifying Party holds an investment), who have
overlapping indemnity, advancement or contribution obligations to an
Indemnified Party. Nothing in this _Section 13(e)_ is intended to diminish
the indemnification and advancement rights given by the Indemnifying Party to
an Indemnified Party, including the right to receive prompt payment of valid
indemnification and advancement claims if any third party is unwilling or
unable to do so promptly.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 13_ shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 14\. _Term; Termination_.

 

(a) Until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this
Agreement shall continue in operation until the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Effective Date (the " _Initial Term_ ") and shall be automatically renewed for
a one (1)-year term on each anniversary date thereafter (a " _Renewal Term_
") unless the Company or the Manager elects not to renew this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 14(a)_ or _Section 14(c)_, respectively. The
Company may elect not to renew this Agreement upon the expiration of the
Initial Term or any Renewal Term by providing at least one hundred eighty
(180) __ days prior written notice to the Manager (the " _Termination
Notice_ ") only if there has been an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds
of the Independent Directors that (i) __ there has been unsatisfactory
performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to the Company and
the Subsidiaries or (ii) __ the compensation payable to the Manager, in the
form of Base Management Fees and Incentive Fees, or the amount thereof, is
unfair to any of the Company Parties. If the Company issues the Termination
Notice, the Company shall be obligated to (x) __ specify the reason for
nonrenewal in the Termination Notice (pursuant to either clause (i) __ or
(ii) __ of the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph) and (y) __
pay the Manager the Termination Fee on or before the last day of the Initial
Term or Renewal Term (the " _Effective Termination Date_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 14(a)_, in the event that such
Termination Notice is given in connection with a determination that the
compensation payable to the Manager is unfair, the Manager shall have the
right to renegotiate such compensation by delivering to the Company, no fewer
than one hundred and twenty (120) __ days prior to the prospective Effective
Termination Date, written notice (any such notice, a " _Notice of Proposal to
Negotiate_ ") of its intention to renegotiate its compensation under this
Agreement. Upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of Proposal to Negotiate,
the Company (represented by the Independent Directors) and the Manager shall
endeavor to negotiate in good faith the revised compensation payable to the
Manager under this

 



33  Agreement. If the Manager and at least two-thirds of the Independent
Directors agree to the terms of the revised compensation to be payable to the
Manager within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Companys
receipt of the Notice of Proposal to Negotiate, the Termination Notice from
the Company shall be deemed of no force and effect, and this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect on the terms stated in this Agreement,
except that the compensation payable to the Manager shall be the revised
compensation then agreed upon by the Company and the Manager. The Company,
Operating Company and the Manager agree to execute and deliver an amendment to
this Agreement setting forth such revised compensation promptly upon reaching
an agreement regarding the same. In the event that the Company and the Manager
are unable to agree to the terms of the revised compensation to be payable to
the Manager during such one hundred and twenty (120)-day period, this
Agreement shall terminate, such termination to be effective on the date that
is the later of (A) __ ten __ (10) days following the end of such one
hundred and twenty (120)-day period and (B) __ the Effective Termination
Date originally set forth in the Termination Notice, and Operating Company
shall be obligated to pay the Manager the Termination Fee upon the effective
date of termination as provided in  _Section 14(b)_ below. Nothing in this
_Section 14(a)_ shall prohibit the Company from discussing or negotiating
with any Person the terms of a replacement manager and management agreement
during such one hundred and twenty (120)-day period.

(b) In recognition of the upfront effort required by the Manager to structure
and acquire the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries and the commitment
of resources by the Manager, in the event that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 14(a)_ or _Section 15(b)_ of this
Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Manager, on the date on which such
termination is effective, a termination fee (the " _Termination Fee_ ") equal
to three (3) __ times the sum of (i) __ the average annual Base Management
Fee and (ii) __ the average annual Incentive Fee, in each case earned by the
Manager during the twenty-four (24)-month period immediately preceding the
most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the date of termination. The
obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

(c) No later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of
the Initial Term or Renewal Term, the Manager may deliver written notice to
the Company informing it of the Managers intention to decline to renew this
Agreement, whereupon this Agreement shall not be renewed and extended and
this Agreement shall terminate effective upon the expiration of the Initial
Term or the applicable Renewal Term following the delivery of such notice. The
Company shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee to the Manager if
the Manager terminates this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 14(c)_.

 



34 (d) In the event of a termination or non-renewal of this Agreement, the
Manager shall reasonably cooperate, at the Companys expense, with the Company
in executing an orderly transition of the management of the Companys
consolidated assets to a new manager.

 

Section 15\. _Termination for Cause_.

 

(a) The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, including during the
Initial Term, upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of
termination from the Board of Directors to the Manager, without payment of any
Termination Fee, if:

(i) the Manager engages in any act or omission that constitutes gross
negligence, bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any of the actions or omissions described in this  _Section
15(a)(i)_ __ are caused by an employee and/or officer of the Manager or one
of its Affiliates and the Manager takes all necessary action against such
person and cures the damage caused by such actions or omissions within thirty
(30) __ days after the Managers receipt of written notice thereof from the
Company, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 15(a)(i)_;

 

(ii) the Manager, its agents or its assignees breaches any material provision
of this Agreement and such breach shall continue for a period of thirty (30)
days after written notice thereof specifying such breach and requesting that
the same be remedied in such thirty (30) __ day period (or forty-five (45) __
days after written notice of such breach if the Manager takes steps to cure
such breach within thirty (30) __ days of the written notice);

(iii) there is a commencement of any proceeding relating to the Bankruptcy or
insolvency of the Manager or Constellation, including an order for relief in
an involuntary Bankruptcy case or the authorization or filing by the Manager
or Constellation of a voluntary Bankruptcy petition;

(iv) the Manager is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a
felony that has a material adverse effect on the business of the Company or
the ability of the Manager to perform its duties under the terms of this
Agreement; or

 

(v) there is a dissolution of the Manager.

 

(b) The Manager may terminate this Agreement effective upon sixty (60) days
prior written notice of termination to the Company in the event that the
Company shall breach this Agreement in any material respect or otherwise be
unable to perform its obligations hereunder and such breach shall continue for
a period of thirty (30) __ days after written notice thereof from the
Manager to the Company specifying such breach and requesting that the same be
remedied in such thirty (30)-day period. The Company shall be required to pay
the Termination Fee to the Manager if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
this  _Section 15(b)_.

 



35 (c) The Manager may terminate this Agreement in the event the Company becomes
regulated or required to register as an "investment company" under the
Investment Company Act, with such termination deemed to have occurred
immediately prior to such event. If the Manager terminates this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 15(c)_, the Company shall not be required to pay
the Termination Fee.

Section 16\. _Survival; Action Upon Termination_. From and after the
effective date of termination or non-renewal of this Agreement, pursuant to
_Sections 14_ , _15_ or _17_ of this Agreement, the Manager shall not be
entitled to compensation for further services under this Agreement, but shall
be paid all compensation accruing to the date of termination and, if
terminated or not renewed pursuant to _Section 14(a)_ or _15(b)_ , the
applicable Termination Fee. Upon such termination, the Manager shall
forthwith:

(i) after deducting any accrued compensation and reimbursement for Expenses
to which it is then entitled, pay over to the Company or a Subsidiary all
money collected and held for the account of the Company or a Subsidiary
pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(ii) deliver to the Board of Directors a full accounting, including a
statement showing all payments collected by it and a statement of all money
held by it, covering the period following the date of the last accounting
furnished to the Board of Directors with respect to the Company or a
Subsidiary;

 

(iii) deliver to the Board of Directors all property and documents of the
Company or any Subsidiary then in the custody of the Manager; _provided_ that
the Manager shall be permitted to retain copies of such documents for its
records, and if so retained, the Manager shall continue to be bound by the
confidentiality obligations and other obligations set forth in  _Section 6_
of this Agreement with respect to the retained documents; and

(iv) _Sections 3(i)_ , _6_ ,  _11_ , _12_ , _13_ , _14_ , _15_ , _16_ and
_25_ shall survive the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.

 

Section 17\. _Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically, without payment of the
Termination Fee, in the event of its assignment, in whole or in part, by the
Manager, unless such assignment is consented to in writing by the Company
after the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Manager may, at any time, (i) assign this
Agreement without the consent of the Company or the approval of the
Independent Directors to any Majority-Owned Affiliate of Constellation and/or
(ii) __ delegate to one or more if its Affiliates, including sub-advisors
where applicable, the performance of any of its responsibilities hereunder
without the consent of the Company or the approval of the Independent
Directors, so

 



36  long as the Manager remains liable for any such Affiliates performance, in
each case so long as such assignment or delegation does not require the
Companys consent under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (but
if any such consent is required, the Company shall not unreasonably withhold,
condition or delay its consent). Any such permitted assignment shall bind the
assignee under this Agreement in the same manner as the Manager is bound, and
the Manager shall be liable to the Company for all errors or omissions of the
assignee under any such assignment. In addition, the assignee shall execute
and deliver to the Company a counterpart of this Agreement naming such
assignee as Manager.

(b) This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company without the prior
written consent of the Manager, except in the case of assignment by the
Company to another REIT or other organization that is a successor (by merger,
consolidation, purchase of assets, or other transaction) to the Company, in
which case such successor organization shall be bound under this Agreement
and by the terms of such assignment in the same manner as the Company is bound
under this Agreement.

 

Section 18\. _Release of Money or Other Property Upon Written Request_. The
Manager agrees that any money or other property of the Company or any
Subsidiary held by the Manager under this Agreement shall be held by the
Manager as custodian for the Company or Subsidiary, and the Managers records
shall be appropriately marked clearly to reflect the ownership of such
money or other property by the Company or such Subsidiary. Upon the receipt
by the Manager of a written request signed by a duly authorized officer of the
Company requesting the Manager to release to the Company or any Subsidiary any
money or other property then held by the Manager for the account of the
Company or any Subsidiary under this Agreement, the Manager shall release such
money or other property to the Company or any Subsidiary within a reasonable
period of time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following such
request. The Manager shall not be liable to the Company, any Subsidiary, the
Board of Directors, or the Companys or a Subsidiarys stockholders, members
or partners for any acts performed or omissions to act by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the money or other property released to the
Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with the second sentence of this
_Section 18_. The Company shall indemnify the Manager and its officers,
directors, personnel, managers, employees, stockholders, partners and agents
from and against any and all Losses that arise out of or in connection with
the Managers release of such money or other property to the Company or any
Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this _Section 18_. Indemnification
pursuant to this provision shall be in addition to any right of the Manager to
indemnification under _Section 13_ of this Agreement.

The Board of Directors has adopted the following investment guidelines:

 



     | a. | No investment shall be made that would cause the Company to
fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | No investment shall be made that would cause the Company or
any Subsidiary to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | Until appropriate investments can be identified, the Manager
may invest the proceeds of the Companys Initial Public Offering, if any, and
any future offerings in interest-bearing, short-term investments,
including money market accounts and/or U.S. treasury securities, that are
consistent with the Companys intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain its
exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | No investment shall require prior approval of the Board of
Directors or a majority of the Independent Directors solely because such
investment constitutes (1) a co-investment made by and between the Company or
any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and one or more investment vehicles formed,
sponsored and managed by the Company or any Subsidiary, on the other hand,
regardless of when such co-investment is made, or (2) __ a transaction
related to any such co-investment; and 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | Any investment with a total cost of more than $500.0 million
shall require the approval of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted
committee of the Board of Directors (with total cost being equal to the sum
of (x) __ the aggregate equity committed by the Company or any Subsidiary in
such investment together with any upfront fees received by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with such investment plus (y) __ without
duplication, the aggregate outstanding indebtedness with respect to such
investment that the Company or any Subsidiary and/or vehicles that the Company
or any Subsidiary controls incur, syndicate and/or co-originate). 
---|---|--- 
 

These Investment Guidelines may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented
or waived pursuant to the approval of the Board (which must include a
majority of the Independent Directors) and the Manager from time to time, but
without the approval of the Companys stockholders.

subsidiaries or entities that provide investment advisory services to the
Corporation or its subsidiaries or as a member of the investment committee of
any such entity, (ii) the Sponsor Affiliates may now engage and may continue

have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly:

 

(i) engaging in any business opportunity, including but not limited to
business opportunities in the same or similar business activities or lines of
business in which the Corporation or any of its Affiliates may, from time to
time, be engaged or propose to engage (a "Business Opportunity"); or

 

(ii) competing with the Corporation, and to the fullest extent permitted by
law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders or creditors for breach of any duty (statutory, contractual or
otherwise (other than for breach by an Identified Person of any express
restrictions on competition contained in any written contract between
such Identified Person and the Corporation)) by reason of the fact that such

Business Opportunity for itself, directs such Business Opportunity to another
Person, or does not present such opportunity to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries or stockholders. A Business Opportunity shall not be deemed to be
a potential Business Opportunity for the Corporation if it is a Business

which holders of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such
rights.

Board of Directors, any such other person, corporation, association, company,
trust, partnership (limited or general) or other organization shall render or
make available to the Corporation managerial, investment, advisory and/or
related services, office space and other services and facilities (including,
if deemed advisable by the Board of Directors, the management or supervision
of the investments of the Corporation) upon such terms and conditions as may

equitable by the Board of Directors, the compensation payable thereunder by
the Corporation).

Section 7.2 _Capital Stock_.

 

Section 7.2.1 _Ownership Limitations_. During the period commencing on the
Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, but subject to
Section 7.4:

(a) _Basic Restrictions_.

 

(i) (1) No Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or
Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit, (2) no Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall
Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Common Stock in excess of the
Common Stock Ownership Limit and (3) no Excepted Holder shall
Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of
the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder.

(ii) No Person shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital
Stock to the extent that (1) such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive
Ownership of Capital Stock would result in the Corporation being "closely
held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to
whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable
year), (2) such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Capital
Stock would result in the Corporation owning (directly or Constructively) an
interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if
the income derived by the Corporation (either directly or indirectly through
one or more partnerships or limited liability companies) from such tenant for
the taxable year of the Corporation during which such determination is being
made would reasonably be expected to equal or exceed the lesser of (A) one
percent (1%) of the Corporations gross income (as determined for purposes of
Section 856(c) of the Code), or (B) an amount that would (or, in the sole
judgment of the Board of Directors, could) cause the Corporation to fail to
satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code,
or (3) such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Capital Stock
would result in the Corporation otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT.

 

(iii) Any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock that, if effective, would result
in the Capital Stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 Persons
(determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be
void _ab_ _initio_ , and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in
such shares of Capital Stock.

 

(b) _ Transfer in Trust_. If any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock occurs
which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or
Constructively Owning shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section
7.2.1(a)(i) or (ii),

(i) then that number of shares of the Capital Stock the Beneficial Ownership
or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to
violate Section 7.2.1(a)(i) or (ii) (rounded up to the nearest whole share)
shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable
Beneficiary, as described in Section 7.3, effective as of the close of
business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such
Person shall acquire no rights in such shares of Capital Stock; or

 



9 (ii) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (i) of this sentence
would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section
7.2.1(a)(i) or (ii), then the Transfer of that number of shares of Capital
Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 7.2.1(a)(i) or
(ii) shall be void  _ab_ _initio_ , and the intended transferee shall acquire
no rights in such shares of Capital Stock.

(iii) To the extent that, upon a transfer of shares of Capital Stock pursuant
to this Section 7.2.1(b), a violation of any provision of this Article VII
would nonetheless be continuing (for example where the ownership of shares of
Capital Stock by a single Trust would violate the 100 stockholder requirement
applicable to REITs), then shares of Capital Stock shall be transferred to
that number of Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and a Charitable
Beneficiary or Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other
Trust, such that there is no violation of any provision of this Article VII.

Section 7.2.2 _Remedies for Breach_. If the Board of Directors shall at any
time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in
a violation of Section 7.2.1 or that a Person intends to acquire or has
attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any
shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 7.2.1 (whether or not such
violation is intended), the Board of Directors shall take such action as it
deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or
other event, including, without limitation, causing the Corporation to redeem
shares of Capital Stock, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books
of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or
other event; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Transfer or attempted Transfer
or other event in violation of Section 7.2.1 shall automatically result in the
transfer to the Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer
(or other event) shall be void _ab_ _initio_ as provided above irrespective
of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 7.2.3 _Notice of Restricted Transfer_. Any Person who acquires or
attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership
of shares of Capital Stock that will or may violate Section 7.2.1(a), or any
Person who would have owned shares of Capital Stock that resulted in a
transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2.1(b), shall
immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event or, in the
case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, shall give at least fifteen
(15) days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Corporation such
other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the
effect, if any, of such Transfer on the Corporations status as a REIT.

 

Section 7.2.4 _Owners Required To Provide Information_. From the Initial Date
and prior to the Restriction Termination Date:

 

(a) every owner of five percent (5%) or more (or such lower percentage as
required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) in
number or value of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock, within thirty (30)
days after the end of each taxable year, shall give written notice to the
Corporation stating (i) the name and address of such owner, (ii) the number
of shares of Capital Stock Beneficially Owned and (iii) a description of the
manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner shall provide to the
Corporation such additional information as the Corporation may request in
order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the
Corporations status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate
Stock Ownership Limit and the Common Stock Ownership Limit; and

 

(b) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Capital
Stock and each Person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding
Capital Stock for a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide to
the Corporation such information as the Corporation may request, in order to
determine the Corporations status as a REIT and to comply with requirements
of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such
compliance and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit
and the Common Stock Ownership Limit.

 

Section 7.2.5 _Remedies Not Limited_. Subject to Section 5.7 of the Charter,
nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall limit the authority of the Board
of Directors to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to
protect the Corporation in preserving the Corporations status as a REIT.

 



10 Section 7.2.6 _Ambiguity_. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of
any of the provisions of this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 or any definition
contained in Section 7.1, the Board of Directors may determine the application
of the provisions of this Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 or any such
definition with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it at
such time. In the event Section 7.2 or 7.3 requires an action by the Board of
Directors and the Charter fails to provide specific guidance with respect to
such action, the Board of Directors may determine the action to be taken so
long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Sections 7.1, 7.2 or
7.3. Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board of Directors, if a Person
would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 7.2.2) acquired
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Capital Stock in violation
of Section 7.2.1, such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the
shares of Capital Stock that, but for the remedies, would have actually been
owned by such Person, and second to the shares of Capital Stock that, but for
such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but
not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who
actually own such shares of Capital Stock based upon the relative number of
the shares of Capital Stock held by each such Person.

 

Section 7.2.7 _Exceptions_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt, prospectively
or retroactively, a Person from the Common Stock Ownership Limit or the
Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, as the case may be, and may establish or
increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if: (i) such Person submits
to the Board of Directors information requested by the Board of
Directors, demonstrating that such Person is not an individual for purposes
of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code (determined taking into account Section
856(h)(3)(A) of the Code); (ii) such Person submits to the Board of Directors
information requested by the Board of Directors, demonstrating that no Person
who is an individual for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code (determined
taking into account Section 856(h)(3)(A) of the Code) would be considered to
Beneficially Own shares of Common Stock in excess of the Common Stock
Ownership Limit or Capital Stock in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit; (iii) such Person submits to the Board of Directors information
requested by the Board of Directors, demonstrating that clauses (1), (2) and
(3) of subparagraph (a)(ii) of Section 7.2.1 will not be violated by reason of
such Persons ownership of Common Stock in excess of the Common Stock
Ownership Limit or Capital Stock in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit pursuant to the exemption granted under this subparagraph 7.2.7(a); and
(iv) such Person provides to the Board of Directors such representations and
undertakings, if any, as the Board of Directors may require to ensure that
the conditions in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof are satisfied and will
continue to be satisfied throughout the period during which such Person owns
Common Stock in excess of the Common Stock Ownership Limit or Capital Stock in
excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit pursuant to any exemption
thereto granted under this subparagraph (a), and such Person agrees that any
violation of such representations and undertakings or any attempted violation
thereof will result in the application of the remedies set forth in Section
7.2 (including, without limitation, Section 7.2.5) with respect to shares of
Common Stock held in excess of the Common Stock Ownership Limit or Capital
Stock held in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit with respect to
such Person (determined without regard to the exemption granted such Person
under this subparagraph (a)).

 

(b) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 7.2.7(a), the Board of
Directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an
opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the
Board of Directors, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to
determine that granting the exception will not cause the Corporation to lose
its status as a REIT; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors
shall not be obligated to require obtaining a favorable ruling or opinion in
order to grant an exception hereunder. Notwithstanding the receipt of any
ruling or opinion, the Board of Directors may impose such conditions and
restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting each
exception.

(c) Subject to Section 7.2.1(a)(ii), an underwriter, placement agent or
initial purchaser that participates in a public offering, a private placement
or other private offering of Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Capital Stock) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own
shares of Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Capital Stock) in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or the Common
Stock Ownership Limit, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such
public offering, private placement or immediate resale of such Capital Stock,
and provided that the restrictions contained in Section 7.2.1(a) will not be
violated following the distribution by such underwriter, placement agent or
initial purchaser of such shares of Capital Stock.

 



11 (d) In connection with granting any exemption or waiver pursuant to Section
7.2.7(a), the Board of Directors may include such terms and conditions in
such waiver as it determines are advisable.

(e) The Board of Directors may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an
Excepted Holder: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any
time, or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and
undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the
establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No
Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the
then-current Common Stock Ownership Limit.

 

Section 7.2.8 _Increase or Decrease in Common Stock Ownership or Aggregate
Stock Ownership Limits_. Subject to Section 7.2.1(a)(ii) and this Section
7.2.8, the Board of Directors may from time to time increase or decrease the
Common Stock Ownership Limit and the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit for one
or more Persons and increase or decrease the Common Stock Ownership Limit and
the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit for all other Persons. No decreased Common
Stock Ownership Limit or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit will be effective for
any Person whose percentage of ownership of Capital Stock is in excess of
such decreased Common Stock Ownership Limit or Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit, as applicable, until such time as such Persons percentage of ownership
of Capital Stock equals or falls below the decreased Common Stock
Ownership Limit or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, as applicable; _provided_
, _however_ , that any further acquisition of Capital Stock by any such Person
(other than a Person for whom an exemption has been granted pursuant to
Section 7.2.7(a) or an Excepted Holder) in excess of the Capital Stock owned
by such Person on the date the decreased Common Stock Ownership Limit or
Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, as applicable, became effective will be in
violation of the Common Stock Ownership Limit or Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit. No increase to the Common Stock Ownership Limit or Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit may be approved if the new Common Stock Ownership Limit and/or
Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit would allow five (5) or fewer Persons to
Beneficially Own, in the aggregate more than forty-nine and nine-tenths
percent (49.9%) in value of the outstanding Capital Stock or would otherwise
cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT.

 

Section 7.2.9 _Legend_. Each certificate for shares of Capital Stock, if
certificated, shall bear substantially the following legend:

The shares represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions on
Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership and Transfer for the purpose,
among others, of the Corporations maintenance of its status as a Real Estate
Investment Trust under the Code. Subject to certain further restrictions and
except as expressly provided in the Corporations Charter, (i) no Person may
Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of the Corporations Common
Stock in excess of the Common Stock Ownership Limit unless such Person is an
Excepted Holder (in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall
be applicable); (ii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own
shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation in excess of the Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit, unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (in which case the
Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable); (iii) no Person may Beneficially
Own or Constructively Own Capital Stock that would result in the Corporation
being "closely held" under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause the
Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT; and (iv) no Person may Transfer
shares of Capital Stock if such Transfer would result in the Capital Stock of
the Corporation being owned by fewer than 100 Persons. Any Person who
Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns or attempts to Beneficially Own or
Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock that causes or will cause a Person
to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess or
in violation of the above limitations must immediately notify the
Corporation. If any of the restrictions on transfer or ownership provided in
(i), (ii) or (iii) above are violated, the shares of Capital Stock in excess
or in violation of the above limitations will be automatically transferred to
a Trustee of a Trust for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries.
In addition, the Corporation may redeem shares upon the terms and conditions
specified by the Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion if the
Board of Directors determines that ownership or a Transfer or other event may
violate the restrictions described above. Furthermore, if the ownership
restrictions provided in (iv) above would be violated or upon the occurrence
of certain events, attempted Transfers in violation of the restrictions
described above may be void _ab_ _initio_. All capitalized terms in this
legend have the meanings defined in the

 



12  Charter of the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, a
copy of which, including the restrictions on transfer and ownership, will be
furnished to each holder of Capital Stock of the Corporation on request and
without charge. Requests for such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of
the Corporation at its principal office.

 

Instead of the foregoing legend, the certificate may state that the
Corporation will furnish a full statement about certain restrictions on
ownership and transfer to a stockholder on request and without charge.

Section 7.3 _Transfer of Capital Stock in Trust_.

 

Section 7.3.1 _Ownership in Trust_. Upon any purported Transfer or other event
described in Section 7.2.1(b) that would result in a transfer of shares of
Capital Stock to a Trust, such shares of Capital Stock shall be deemed to have
been transferred to the Trustee as trustee of a Trust for the exclusive
benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Such transfer to the Trustee
shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business
Day prior to the purported Transfer or other event that results in the
transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 7.2.1(b). The Trustee shall be
appointed by the Corporation and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the
Corporation and any Prohibited Owner. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be
designated by the Corporation as provided in Section 7.3.6.

 

Section 7.3.2 _Status of Shares Held by the Trustee_. Shares of Capital Stock
held by the Trustee shall continue to be issued and outstanding shares of
Capital Stock of the Corporation. The Prohibited Owner shall have no rights in
the shares held by the Trustee. The Prohibited Owner shall not benefit
economically from ownership of any shares held in trust by the Trustee,
shall have no rights to dividends or other distributions and shall not
possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares held in
the Trust. The Prohibited Owner shall have no claim, cause of action or any
other recourse whatsoever against the purported transferor of such Capital
Stock of the Corporation.

Section 7.3.3 _Dividend and Voting Rights_. The Trustee shall have all voting
rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to shares
of Capital Stock held in the Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the
exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any dividend or other
distribution paid to a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the
Corporation that the shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the
Trustee shall be paid by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee upon demand and
any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when
due to the Trustee. Any dividend or other distribution so paid to the Trustee
shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner
shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Capital Stock held in
the Trust and, subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that the
shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall have the authority (at the Trustees sole and absolute discretion) (i)
to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery
by the Corporation that the shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to
the Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if
the Corporation has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the
Trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VII, until the Corporation
has received notification that shares of Capital Stock have been transferred
into a Trust, the Corporation shall be entitled to rely on its stock transfer
and other stockholder records for purposes of preparing lists of stockholders
entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and authority of
proxies and otherwise conducting votes and determining the other rights of
stockholders.

 

Section 7.3.4 _Sale of Shares by Trustee_. Within twenty (20) days of
receiving notice from the Corporation that shares of Capital Stock have been
transferred to the Trust, the Trustee of the Trust shall sell the shares held
in the Trust to a person, designated by the Trustee, whose ownership of the
shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section
7.2.1(a). Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the
shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds
of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as
provided in this Section 7.3.4. The Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser
of (i) the price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the shares or, if the
Prohibited Owner did not give value for the shares in connection with the
event causing the shares to be held in the Trust ( _e.g._ , in the case of a
gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price of the shares on the
day of the event causing the shares to be held in the Trust and (ii) the price
per share received by the Trustee (net of any commissions and other expenses
of sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the Trust.
The Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited

 



13  Owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions that have been paid
to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee
pursuant to Section 7.3.3 of this Article VII. Any net sales proceeds in
excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid
to the Charitable Beneficiary. If, prior to the discovery by the Corporation
that shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee, such
shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such shares shall be deemed to
have been sold on behalf of the Trust and (ii) to the extent that the
Prohibited Owner received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount
that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
7.3.4, such excess shall be paid to the Trustee upon demand.

 

Section 7.3.5 _Purchase Right in Stock Transferred to the Trustee_. Shares of
Capital Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered
for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to
the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such
transfer to the Trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the Market Price
at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the
Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Corporation may reduce
the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and
other distributions that have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed
by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.3.3 of this
Article VII. The Corporation may pay the amount of such reduction to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Corporation shall
have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares held
in the Trust pursuant to Section 7.3.4. Upon such a sale to the Corporation,
the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate
and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the
Prohibited Owner and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the
shares sold that are held by the Trustee shall be paid to the Charitable
Beneficiary.

Section 7.3.6 _Designation of Charitable Beneficiaries_. By written notice to
the Trustee, the Corporation shall designate one or more nonprofit
organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary or Charitable Beneficiaries of
the interest in the Trust such that (i) the shares of Capital Stock held in
the Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 7.2.1(a) in
the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary or Charitable Beneficiaries and (ii)
each such organization must be described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code and
contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under
each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code. Neither the failure
of the Corporation to make such designation nor the failure of the Corporation
to appoint the Trustee before the automatic transfer provided in Section
7.2.1(b) shall make such transfer ineffective; _provided_ , that the
Corporation thereafter makes such designation and appointment.

 

Section 7.3.7 _Rights Upon Liquidation_. Upon any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets
of the Corporation, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably with
each other holder of shares of the class or series of Capital Stock that is
held in the Trust, that portion of the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to the holders of such class or series (determined based upon
the ratio that the number of shares of such class or series of Capital Stock
held by the Trustee bears to the total number of shares of such class or
series of Capital Stock then outstanding). The Trustee shall distribute any
such assets received in respect of the shares held in the Trust in any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of, or distribution of the assets of
the Corporation, in accordance with Section 7.3.4.

Section 7.4 _Stock Exchange Transactions_. Nothing in this Article VII shall
preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the
facilities of the Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or
automated inter-dealer quotation system. The fact that the settlement of any
transaction occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this
Article VII and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all
of the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article VII.

 

Section 7.5 _Enforcement_. The Corporation is authorized specifically to seek
equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of
this Article VII.

Section 7.6 _Non-Waiver_. No delay or failure on the part of the Corporation
or the Board of Directors in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver of any right of the Corporation or the Board of Directors, as the case
may be, except to the extent specifically waived in writing.

meeting.

Section 2\. _ANNUAL MEETING_. An annual meeting of stockholders for the
election of directors and the transaction of any business within the powers of
the Corporation shall be held on the date and at the time and place set by the
Board of Directors.

 

Section 3\. _SPECIAL MEETINGS_.

 

(a) _General_. Each of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Vice Chairman
of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, President and the Board
of Directors may call a special meeting of stockholders. Except as provided in
subsection (b)(3) of this Section 3, a special meeting of stockholders shall
be held on the date and at the time and place set by the Chairman of
the Board of Directors, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief
Executive Officer, President or the Board of Directors, whoever has called the
meeting. Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 3, a special meeting of
stockholders shall also be called by the Secretary of the Corporation to act
on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders
upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting.

(b) _Stockholder-Requested Special Meetings_. (1) Any stockholder of record
seeking to have stockholders request a special meeting shall, by sending
written notice to the Secretary (the "Record Date Request Notice") by
registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to
fix a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to request a special
meeting (the "Request Record Date"). The Record Date Request Notice shall set
forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at
it, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record as of the date of
signature (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the
Record Date Request Notice), shall bear the date of signature of each such
stockholder (or such agent) and shall set forth all information relating to
each such stockholder and each matter proposed to be acted on at the meeting
that would be required to be disclosed in connection with the solicitation of
proxies for the election of directors in an election contest (even if an
election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in
connection with such a solicitation, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A
(or any successor provision) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange
Act"). Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors
may fix a Request Record Date. The Request Record Date shall not precede and
shall not be more than ten (10) days after the close of business on the date
on

 



1  which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board
of Directors. If the Board of Directors, within ten (10) days after the date
on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a
resolution fixing the Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be
the close of business on the tenth (10th) day after the first date on which
a Record Date Request Notice is received by the Secretary.

(2) In order for any stockholder to request a special meeting to act on
any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders, one
or more written requests for a special meeting (collectively, the "Special
Meeting Request") signed by stockholders of record (or their agents duly
authorized in a writing accompanying the request) as of the Request Record
Date entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to
be cast on such matter at such meeting (the "Special Meeting Percentage")
shall be delivered to the Secretary. In addition, the Special Meeting Request
shall (i) set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be
acted on at it (which shall be limited to those lawful matters set forth in
the Record Date Request Notice received by the Secretary), (ii) bear the date
of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) signing the Special
Meeting Request, (iii) set forth the name and address, as they appear in the
Corporations books, of each stockholder signing such request (or on whose
behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed), the class, series and number of
all shares of stock of the Corporation that are owned (beneficially or of
record) by each such stockholder, and the nominee holder for, and the number
of shares owned by such stockholder beneficially but not of record, (iv) be
sent to the Secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and (v) be
received by the Secretary within sixty (60) days after the Request Record
Date. Any requesting stockholder (or agent duly authorized in a writing
accompanying the revocation of the Special Meeting Request) may revoke his,
her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation
delivered to the Secretary. The Secretary shall inform the requesting
stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the
notice of meeting (including the Corporations proxy materials). The Secretary
shall not be required to call a special meeting upon stockholder request and
such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required
by the foregoing, the Secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated
cost prior to the preparation and mailing or delivery of any notice of the
meeting. The Board of Directors may revoke the notice for any Stockholder
Requested Meeting in the event that the requesting stockholders fail to comply
with this paragraph (2) of Section 3(b).

 

(3) In the case of any special meeting called by the Secretary upon the
request of stockholders (a "Stockholder-Requested Meeting"), such meeting
shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board
of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that the date of any Stockholder-
Requested Meeting shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the
record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"); and _provided
further_ that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten (10)
days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received
by the Secretary (the "Delivery Date"), a date and time for a Stockholder-
Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m., local time,
on the ninetieth (90th) day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such
ninetieth (90th) day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first
preceding Business Day; and _provided further_ that in the event that the
Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder-Requested
Meeting within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall
be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In fixing a date
for Stockholder Requested Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such
factors as it deems relevant, including, without limitation, the nature of
the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any
request for the meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an
annual meeting or a special meeting. In the case of any Stockholder-Requested
Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is
a date within thirty (30) days after the Delivery Date, then the close of
business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Delivery Date shall be the
Meeting Record Date.

(4) If written revocations of the Special Meeting Request have been delivered
to the Secretary and the result is that stockholders of record (or their
agents duly authorized in writing), as of the Request Record Date, entitled to
cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage have delivered, and not revoked,
requests for a special meeting on the matter to the Secretary: (i) if the
notice of meeting has not already been delivered, the Secretary shall refrain
from delivering the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting
stockholders who have not revoked such requests written notice of
any revocation of a request for a special meeting on the matter, or (ii) if
the notice of meeting has been delivered and if the Secretary first sends to
all requesting stockholders who have not revoked requests for a special
meeting on the matter written notice of any revocation of a request for the
special meeting and written notice of the Corporations intention to revoke
the notice of the meeting or for the chairman of the meeting to adjourn the
meeting without action on the matter, (A) the Secretary may revoke the notice
of the meeting at any time before ten (10) days before the commencement of the
meeting or (B) the chairman of the meeting may call the meeting to order and
adjourn the meeting from time to time without acting on the matter. Any
request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of
a notice of meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting.

 



2 (5) The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board of Directors may
appoint regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of
elections to act as the agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly
performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported Special
Meeting Request received by the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the
inspectors to perform such review, no such purported Special Meeting Request
shall be deemed to have been received by the Secretary until the earlier of
(i) five (5) Business Days after actual receipt by the Secretary of such
purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to
the Corporation that the valid requests received by the Secretary represent,
as of the Request Record Date, stockholders of record entitled to cast not
less than the Special Meeting Percentage. Nothing contained in this paragraph
(5) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation
or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any
request, whether during or after such five (5) Business Day period, or to take
any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution
or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of
injunctive relief in such litigation).

(6) For purposes of these Bylaws, "Business Day" shall mean any day other
than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State
of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

 

Section 4\. _NOTICE_.

 

(a) Not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) days before each meeting
of stockholders, the Secretary shall give to each stockholder entitled to
vote at such meeting and to each stockholder not entitled to vote who is
entitled to notice of the meeting notice in writing or by electronic
transmission stating the date, time and place of the meeting and, in the case
of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the
purpose for which the meeting is called, by mail, by presenting it to such
stockholder personally, by leaving it at the stockholders residence or usual
place of business, by electronic transmission or by any other means permitted
by Maryland law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when
deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at the
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid. If transmitted electronically, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an electronic
transmission to any address or number of the stockholder at which the
stockholder receives electronic transmissions. The Corporation may give a
single notice to all stockholders who share an address, which single notice
shall be effective as to any stockholder at such address, unless a stockholder
at such address objects to receiving such single notice or revokes a prior
consent to receiving such single notice. Failure to give notice of any meeting
to one or more stockholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not
affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accordance with this Article II
or the validity of any proceedings at any such meeting.

(b) Subject to Section 11(a) of this Article II, any business of the
Corporation may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders without
being specifically designated in the notice, except such business as is
required by any statute to be stated in such notice. No business shall be
transacted at a special meeting of stockholders except as specifically
designated in the notice of such special meeting. The Corporation may postpone
or cancel a meeting of stockholders by notice to the stockholders prior to
convening any such meeting or by making a public announcement (as defined in
Section 11(c)(3) of this Article II) of such postponement or cancellation
prior to the meeting. Notice of the date, time and place to which the meeting
is postponed shall be given not less than ten (10) days prior to such date
and otherwise in the manner set forth in this section.

Section 5\. _ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT_. Every meeting of stockholders shall
be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be
chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment or appointed
individual, by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in the case of a
vacancy in the office or absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, by
one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order:
the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the
President, the Vice Presidents in their order of rank and, within each rank,
in their order of seniority, the Secretary, or, in the absence of

 



3  such officers, a chairman chosen by the stockholders by the vote of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting by stockholders
present in person or by proxy. The Secretary or, in the case of a vacancy in
the office or absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or an
individual appointed by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting
shall act as secretary of the meeting. In the event that the
Secretary presides at a meeting of stockholders, an Assistant Secretary, or,
in the absence of all Assistant Secretaries, an individual appointed by the
Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, shall record the minutes of
the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any
meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting.
The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of the chairman of the
meeting and without any action by the stockholders, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a) restricting
admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting
attendance or participation at the meeting to stockholders of record of the
Corporation, their duly authorized proxies and such other individuals as the
chairman of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting the time allotted to
questions or comments; (d) determining when and for how long the polls should
be opened and when the polls should be closed; (e) maintaining order and
security at the meeting; (f) removing any stockholder or any other individual
who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set
forth by the chairman of the meeting; (g) concluding a meeting or recessing or
adjourning the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, to a later date
and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (h) complying with any
state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Unless
otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with any rules of
parliamentary procedure.

Section 6\. _QUORUM_. At any meeting of stockholders, the presence in person
or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast at such meeting on any matter shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business; but this section shall not affect any
requirement under any statute or under the charter of the Corporation (the
"Charter") for the vote necessary for the approval of any matter. If such
quorum is not established at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of
the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time to a date not more than
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the original record date without
notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting, if a
quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally convened.

The stockholders present either in person or by proxy at a meeting that has
been duly called and at which a quorum has been established, may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal from the
meeting of enough stockholders to leave fewer than would be required to
establish a quorum.

Section 7\. _VOTING_. A nominee for director shall be elected as a
director only if such nominee receives the affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a meeting of stockholders
duly called and at which a quorum is present. However, directors shall be
elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders
duly called and at which a quorum is present for which (a) the Secretary
receives notice that a stockholder has nominated an individual for election as
a director in compliance with the requirements of advance notice of
stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article II, Section 11 of these
Bylaws, and (b) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on
or before the close of business on the tenth (10th) day before the date of
filing of the definitive proxy statement of the Corporation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and, as a result of which, the number of
nominees is greater than the number of directors to be elected at the
meeting. Each share of stock entitles the holder thereof to vote for as many
individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the
holder of such share of stock is entitled to vote. A majority of the votes
cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present
shall be sufficient to approve any other matter that may properly come before
the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast or entitled to be
cast is required by statute or by the Charter. Unless otherwise provided by
statute or by the Charter, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of
class, entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote on each matter submitted
to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. Voting on any question or in any
election may be _viva voce_ unless the chairman of the meeting shall order
that voting be by ballot or otherwise.

 

Section 8\. _PROXIES_. A holder of record of shares of stock of the
Corporation may cast votes in person or by proxy executed by the stockholder
or by the stockholders duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by
applicable law. Such proxy or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be
filed with the Secretary before or at the meeting. No proxy shall be valid
more than eleven (11) months after its date unless otherwise provided in the
proxy.

 



4 Section 9\. _VOTING OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS_. Shares of stock of the
Corporation registered in the name of a corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, if entitled to be
voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, managing member,
director, manager, general partner or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or
a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other
person who has been appointed to vote such shares of stock pursuant to a bylaw
or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or
agreement of the partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such
bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such shares
of stock. Any trustee or fiduciary, in such capacity, may vote shares
of stock registered in such trustees or fiduciarys name, either in person
or by proxy.

Shares of stock of the Corporation directly or indirectly owned by it shall
not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total
number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless
they are held by it, directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary capacity, in
which case they may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total
number of outstanding shares at any given time.

 

The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a
stockholder may certify in writing to the Corporation that any shares
of stock registered in the name of the stockholder are held for the account
of a specified person other than the stockholder. The resolution shall set
forth the class of stockholders who may make the certification, the purpose
for which the certification may be made, the form of certification and the
information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a
record date, the time after the record date within which the certification
must be received by the Corporation; and any other provisions with respect to
the procedure which the Board of Directors considers necessary or appropriate.
On receipt by the Secretary of such certification, the person specified in the
certification shall be regarded as, for the purposes set forth in the
certification, the stockholder of record of the specified shares of stock in
place of the stockholder who makes the certification.

 

Section 10\. _INSPECTORS_. The Board of Directors or the chairman of the
meeting may appoint, before or at the meeting, one or more inspectors for the
meeting and any successor to the inspector. Except as otherwise provided by
the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors, if any, shall (a) determine the
number of shares of stock represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy,
and the validity and effect of proxies, (b) receive and tabulate all votes,
ballots or consents, (c) report such tabulation to the chairman of the
meeting, (d) hear and determine all challenges and questions arising
in connection with the right to vote, and (e) do such acts as are proper to
fairly conduct the election or vote. Each such report shall be in writing and
signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one
inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the
report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the
inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and
the results of the voting shall be  _prima facie_ evidence thereof.

Section 11\. _ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR AND OTHER
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS_.

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. (1) Nominations of individuals for
election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be
considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of
stockholders (i) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting, (ii) by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the record date set by the
Board of Directors for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to
vote at the annual meeting, at the time of giving of notice by the
stockholder as provided for in this Section 11(a) and at the time of the
annual meeting (and any postponement or adjournment thereof), who is entitled
to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on
any such other business and who has complied with this Section 11(a).

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this
Section 11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing
to the Secretary and any such other business must otherwise be a
proper matter for action by the stockholders. To be timely, a stockholders
notice shall set forth all information required under this

 



5  Section 11 and shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive office of the Corporation not earlier than the one hundred fiftieth
(150th) day nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the one hundred
twentieth (120th) day prior to the first (1st) anniversary of the date of the
proxy statement (as defined in Section 11(c)(3) of this Article II) for
the preceding years annual meeting; _provided, however_ , that in connection
with the Corporations first annual meeting or in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than thirty (30) days
from the first (1st) anniversary of the date of the preceding years annual
meeting, in order for notice by the stockholder to be timely, such notice must
be so delivered not earlier than the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day prior
to the date of such annual meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,
on the later of the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the date of
such annual meeting, as originally convened, and the tenth (10) day following
the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first
made. The public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of an annual
meeting shall not commence a new time period for the giving of
a stockholders notice as described above.

(3) Such stockholders notice shall set forth:

 

(i) as to each individual whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election or reelection as a director (each, a "Proposed Nominee"), all
information relating to the Proposed Nominee that would be required to be
disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of
the Proposed Nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an
election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in
connection with such solicitation, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or
any successor provision) under the Exchange Act;

 

(ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before
the meeting, a description of such business, the stockholders reasons for
proposing such business at the meeting and any material interest in such
business of such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined
below), individually or in the aggregate, including any anticipated benefit
to the stockholder or the Stockholder Associated Person therefrom;

(iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice, any Proposed Nominee and any
Stockholder Associated Person,

(A) the class, series and number of all shares of stock or other securities of
the Corporation or any affiliate thereof (collectively, the "Company
Securities"), if any, that are owned (beneficially or of record) by such
stockholder, Proposed Nominee or Stockholder Associated Person, and any short
interest (including any opportunity to profit or share in any benefit from
any decrease in the price of such stock or other security) in any Company
Securities of any such person,

 

(B) the nominee holder for, and number of, any Company Securities owned
beneficially but not of record by such stockholder, Proposed Nominee or
Stockholder Associated Person,

(C) whether and the extent to which such stockholder, Proposed Nominee or
Stockholder Associated Person, directly or indirectly (through brokers,
nominees or otherwise), is subject to any hedging, derivative or other
transaction or series of transactions or entered into any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding (including any short interest, any borrowing or
lending of securities or any proxy or voting agreement), the effect or intent
of which is to (I) manage risk or benefit from changes in the price of Company
Securities for such stockholder, Proposed Nominee or Stockholder Associated
Person or (II) increase or decrease the voting power of such stockholder,
Proposed Nominee or Stockholder Associated Person in the Corporation or any
affiliate thereof disproportionately to such persons economic interest in
the Company Securities; and

(D) any substantial interest, direct or indirect (including, without
limitation, any existing or prospective commercial, business or contractual
relationship with the Corporation), by security holdings or otherwise, of such
stockholder, Proposed Nominee or Stockholder Associated Person, in the
Corporation or any affiliate thereof, other than an interest arising from the
ownership of Company Securities where such stockholder, Proposed Nominee or
Stockholder Associated Person receives no extra or special benefit not shared
on a _pro rata_ basis by all other holders of the same class or series; and

 



6 (iv) as to the stockholder giving the notice, any Stockholder Associated
Person with an interest or ownership referred to in clauses (ii) or (iii) of
this paragraph (3) of this Section 11(a) and any Proposed Nominee,

 

(A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporations stock ledger, and the current name and business address, if
different, of each such Stockholder Associated Person and any Proposed
Nominee,

(B) the investment strategy or objective, if any, of such stockholder and
each such Stockholder Associated Person who is not an individual, and

(C) to the extent known by the stockholder giving the notice, the name and
address of any other stockholder supporting the Proposed Nominee for election
or reelection as a director or the proposal of other business on the date of
such stockholders notice.

 

(4) Such stockholders notice shall, with respect to any Proposed Nominee, be
accompanied by a written undertaking executed by the Proposed Nominee (i)
that such Proposed Nominee (a) is not, and will not become, a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than
the Corporation in connection with service or action as a director that has
not been disclosed to the Corporation and (b) will serve as a director of the
Corporation if elected; and (ii) attaching a completed Proposed Nominee
questionnaire (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Corporation,
upon request by the stockholder providing the notice, and shall include all
information relating to the Proposed Nominee that would be required to be
disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of
the Proposed Nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an
election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in
connection with such solicitation, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or
any successor provision) under the Exchange Act, or would be required
pursuant to the rules of any national securities exchange on which any
securities of the Corporation are listed or over-the-counter market on which
any securities of the Corporation are traded).

(5) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (a) of this Section 11 to
the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
Board of Directors is increased, and there is no public announcement of such
action at least one hundred and thirty (130) days prior to the first (1st)
anniversary of the date of the proxy statement (as defined in Section 11(c)(3)
of this Article II) for the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders
notice required by this Section 11(a) shall also be considered timely, but
only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase,
if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive office of
the Corporation not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the
Corporation.

 

(6) For purposes of this Section 11, "Stockholder Associated Person" of any
stockholder shall mean (i) any person acting in concert with such
stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation
owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder (other than a stockholder
that is a depositary) and (iii) any person that directly, or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
common control with, such stockholder or such Stockholder Associated Person.

 

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting. Nominations of
individuals for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special
meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected only (i) by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the special
meeting has been called in accordance with Section 3(a) of this Article II for
the purpose of electing directors, by any stockholder of the Corporation who
is a stockholder of record at the record date set by the Board of Directors
for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 11 and
at the time of the special meeting (and any postponement or adjournment
thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each
individual so nominated and who has complied with the notice procedures set
forth in this Section 11\. In the event the Corporation calls a special
meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more individuals to
the Board of Directors, any stockholder may nominate an individual or
individuals (as the case may be) for election as a director as specified in
the Corporations notice of meeting, if the stockholders notice, containing
the information required by paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of

 



7  this Section 11, is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
office of the Corporation not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th)
day prior to such special meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,
on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and the
tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first
made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the
Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. The public announcement of a
postponement or adjournment of a special meeting shall not commence a new time
period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

(c) _General_. (1) If information submitted pursuant to this Section 11 by
any stockholder proposing a nominee for election as a director or any proposal
for other business at a meeting of stockholders shall be inaccurate in any
material respect, such information may be deemed not to have been provided in
accordance with this Section 11\. Any such stockholder shall notify the
Corporation of any inaccuracy or change (within two (2) Business Days of
becoming aware of such inaccuracy or change) in any such information. Upon
written request by the Secretary or the Board of Directors, any such
stockholder shall provide, within five (5) Business Days of delivery of such
request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), (A)
written verification, satisfactory, in the discretion of the Board of
Directors or any authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the
accuracy of any information submitted by the stockholder pursuant to this
Section 11, and (B) a written update of any information (including, if
requested by the Corporation, written confirmation by such stockholder that it
continues to intend to bring such nomination or other business proposal before
the meeting) submitted by the stockholder pursuant to this Section 11 as of
an earlier date. If a stockholder fails to provide such written verification
or written update within such period, the information as to which written
verification or a written update was requested may be deemed not to have been
provided in accordance with this Section 11\.

(2) Only such individuals who are nominated in accordance with this Section 11
shall be eligible for election by stockholders as directors, and only such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 11\. The chairman
of the meeting shall have the power to determine whether a nomination or any
other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed,
as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 11 and, if he or she

with this Section 11, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be
disregarded.

have the same meaning as "the date of the companys proxy statement released
to shareholders" as used in Rule 14a-8(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
as interpreted by the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to
time. "Public announcement" shall mean disclosure (A) in a press release
reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, Business Wire, PR
Newswire or other widely circulated news or wire service or (B) in a document
publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Exchange Act.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law
and of the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in this Section
11; _provided, however,_ that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange
Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not
limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other
business to be considered pursuant to this Section 11\. Nothing in this
Section 11 shall be deemed to affect any right of a stockholder to request
inclusion of a proposal in, or the right of the Corporation to omit a proposal
from, any proxy statement filed by the Corporation with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision)
under the Exchange Act. Nothing in this Section 11 shall require disclosure of
revocable proxies received by the stockholder or Stockholder Associated
Person pursuant to a solicitation of proxies after the filing of an effective
Schedule 14A by such stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person under
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act.

 

(5) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, except as
otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, if the stockholder
giving notice as provided for in this Section 11 does not appear in person or
by proxy at such annual or special meeting to present each nominee for
election as a director or the proposed business, as applicable, such matter
shall not be considered at the meeting.

apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of the Corporation.
This section may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before

such action is given by each director and is filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors.

Section 11\. _VACANCIES_ _._ If for any reason any or all of the directors
cease to be directors, such event shall not terminate the Corporation or
affect these Bylaws or the powers of the remaining directors hereunder. Except
as may be provided by the Board of Directors in setting the terms of any class
or series of preferred stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors for any
cause other than an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a
majority of the remaining directors, even if such majority is less than a
quorum. Any vacancy in the number of directors created by an increase in the
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the entire Board of
Directors. Any individual so elected as director shall serve until the next

Directors or of any committee thereof and for their expenses, if any,

reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, by
a lawyer, certified public accountant or other person, as to a matter that the
director or officer reasonably believes to be within the
persons professional or expert competence, or, with respect to a director,
by a committee of the Board of Directors on which the director does not serve,
as to a matter within its designated authority, if the director reasonably
believes the committee to merit confidence.

Section 14\. _RATIFICATION_. The Board of Directors or the stockholders may
ratify any action or inaction by the Corporation or its officers to the
extent that the Board of Directors or the stockholders could have originally
authorized the matter, and if so ratified, shall have the same force and
effect as if originally duly authorized, and such ratification shall be
binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders. Any action or inaction
questioned in any stockholders derivative proceeding or any other proceeding
on the ground of lack of authority, defective or irregular execution, adverse

accounting or otherwise, may be ratified, before or after judgment, by the

feasible under the circumstances, (b) notice of any meeting of the Board of
Directors during such an Emergency may be given less than twenty-four (24)

signed by the officers of the Corporation in any manner permitted by the MGCL.

destroyed, stolen or mutilated; _provided, however_ , that if such shares of
stock have ceased to be certificated, no new certificate shall be issued
unless requested in writing by such stockholder and the Board of Directors or
an officer of the Corporation has determined that such certificates may be
issued. Unless otherwise determined by an officer of the Corporation, the
owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or
certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be required, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to
give the Corporation a bond in such sums as it may direct as indemnity against

to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or determining
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of
any other rights, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any
other proper purpose. Such record date, in any case, shall not be prior to the
close of business on the day the record date is fixed and shall be not more
than ninety (90) days and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, not less
than ten (10) days, before the date on which the meeting or particular action
requiring such determination of stockholders of record is to be held or taken.

 

When a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been set as provided in this
section, such record date shall continue to apply to the meeting if postponed
or adjourned, except if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a date more
than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the record date originally fixed
for the meeting, in which case a new record date for such meeting shall be
determined as set forth herein.

Section 5\. _STOCK LEDGER_. The Corporation shall maintain at its principal

original or duplicate stock ledger containing the name and address of each
stockholder and the number of shares of each class of stock held by such
stockholder.

Section 6\. _FRACTIONAL STOCK; ISSUANCE OF UNITS_. The Board of Directors
may authorize the Corporation to issue fractional shares of stock or
authorize the issuance of scrip, all on such terms and under such conditions
as it may determine. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter or
these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of units
consisting of different securities of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

law and the Charter.

 

Section 2\. _CONTINGENCIES_. Before payment of any dividend or other
distribution, there may be set aside out of any assets of the Corporation

Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve.

Board of Directors may authorize one or more duplicate seals and provide for
the custody thereof.

Section 2\. _AFFIXING SEAL_. Whenever the Corporation is permitted or
required to affix its seal to a document, it shall be sufficient to meet the
requirements of any law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place the

the document on behalf of the Corporation.

ARTICLE XII

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCE OF EXPENSES

 

To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time,
the Corporation shall indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary
determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, shall pay or
reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding
to (a) any individual who is a present or former director or officer of
the Corporation and who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or
witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or
(b) any individual who, while a director or officer of the Corporation and at
the request of the Corporation, serves or has served as a director, officer,
trustee, member, manager, employee, partner or agent of another corporation,
real estate investment trust, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise and who is made
or threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason
of his or her service in that capacity. The rights to indemnification and
advance of expenses provided by the Charter and these Bylaws shall vest
immediately upon election of a director or officer. The Corporation shall
provide such indemnification and advancement for expenses to an individual who
served a predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described
in (a) or (b) above and may, with the approval of its Board of Directors,
provide the same (or lesser) indemnification and advancement of expenses to
any employee or agent of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation.

 

The indemnification and payment or reimbursement of expenses provided in these
Bylaws shall not be deemed exclusive of or limit in any way any other rights
to which any person seeking indemnification or payment or reimbursement of
expenses may be or may become entitled under any bylaw, resolution, insurance,
agreement or otherwise.

 

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption or
amendment of any other provision of the Charter or these Bylaws inconsistent
with this Article, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability
of this Article with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior
to the effective date of such amendment, repeal or adoption.

 

ARTICLE XIII

WAIVER OF NOTICE

Whenever any notice of a meeting is required to be given pursuant to the
Charter or these Bylaws or pursuant to applicable law, a waiver thereof in
writing or by electronic transmission, given by the person or persons entitled
to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be
transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver
of notice of such meeting, unless specifically required by statute. The
attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the
meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.

 



17 ARTICLE XIV

 

EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LITIGATION

follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

DEFINED TERMS 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_. The following definitions shall be for all
purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the
terms used in this Agreement:

" _Act_ " has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.

 

" _Actions_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 7.7.A hereof.

 

" _Additional Funds_ " means any additional funds that the Managing Member
may, at any time and from time to time, determine that the Company requires
for the acquisition of additional properties, for the redemption of Membership
Units or for such other purposes as the Managing Member may determine.

 



2 " _Additional Member_ " means a Person who is admitted to the Company as a
Member pursuant to the Act and Section 12.2 hereof, who is shown as such on
the books and records of the Company, and who has not ceased to be a Member
pursuant to the Act and this Agreement.

 

" _Adjusted Available Cash_ " means, as of any date of determination, the sum
of Available Cash and REIT Available Cash.

 

" _Adjusted Capital Account Deficit_ " means, with respect to any Member, the
deficit balance, if any, in such Members Capital Account as of the end of
the relevant Fiscal Year, after giving effect to the following adjustments:



     | (i) | decrease such deficit by any amounts that such Member is
obligated to restore pursuant to this Agreement or by operation of law upon
liquidation of such Members Membership Interest or that such Member is deemed
to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentence of each of
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | increase such deficit by the items described in Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6). 
---|---|--- 
 

The foregoing definition of "Adjusted Capital Account Deficit" is intended to
comply with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

" _Adjustment Events_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 4.5.A(i) hereof.

" _Adjustment Factor_ " means 1.0;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that:



     | (i) | CLNS Credit (a) declares or pays a dividend on its
outstanding REIT Shares wholly or partly in REIT Shares or makes a
distribution to all holders of its outstanding REIT Shares wholly or partly in
REIT Shares, (b) splits or subdivides its outstanding REIT Shares or (c) __
effects a reverse stock split or otherwise combines its outstanding REIT
Shares into a smaller number of REIT Shares, the Adjustment Factor shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Adjustment Factor then in effect by a fraction,
(i) __ the numerator of which shall be the number of REIT Shares issued and
outstanding on the record date for such dividend, distribution, split,
subdivision, reverse split or combination (assuming for such purposes that
such dividend, distribution, split, subdivision, reverse split or combination
has occurred as of such time) and (ii) __ the denominator of which shall be
the actual number of REIT Shares (determined without the above assumption)
issued and outstanding on the record date for such dividend, distribution,
split, subdivision, reverse split or combination;

exercisable for REIT Shares (other than REIT Shares issuable pursuant to a
Qualified DRIP), at a  

---|---|--- 
 



3 record date for such distribution (each, a " _Distributed Right_ "), then, as
of the distribution date of such Distributed Rights or, if later, the time
such Distributed Rights become exercisable, the Adjustment Factor shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Adjustment Factor then in effect by a fraction (a)
the numerator of which shall be the number of REIT Shares issued and

     | (iii) | CLNS Credit shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to
all holders of its REIT Shares evidences of its indebtedness or its assets
(including securities, but excluding cash or any dividend or distribution
referred to in subsection (i) or (ii) above, or any Membership Units), which
evidences of indebtedness or assets relate to assets not received by CLNS

shall be such Value of a REIT Share as of the trading day immediately
preceding the ex-date for such dividend or distribution and (b) the

Factor for any class or series of Membership Interests to the extent that the
Company concurrently makes or effects a correlative distribution or payment to
all of the Members holding Membership Interests of such class or series, or
effects a correlative split, subdivision, reverse split or combination in
respect of the Membership Interests of such class or series. If CLNS Credit
effects a dividend that allows holders of REIT Shares to elect to receive
cash or additional REIT Shares, the Company may effect a correlative
distribution by distributing to all Members holding Membership Interests of
such class or series a combination of cash and additional Membership Interests
in the same ratio as the ratio of cash and REIT Shares paid by CLNS Credit,
without offering Members an opportunity to elect to receive cash or additional

 



4  Membership Interests. Any adjustments to the Adjustment Factor shall become

any, for such event. For illustrative purposes, examples of adjustments to

Section 2.4 _Power of Attorney_.

A. Each Member and Assignee hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Managing Member, any Liquidator, and authorized officers and attorneys-in-
fact of each, and each of those acting singly, in each case with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full
power and authority in its name, place and stead to:



     | (1) | execute, swear to, seal, acknowledge, deliver, file and
record in the appropriate public offices (a) all certificates, documents and
other instruments (including this Agreement and the Certificate and
all amendments, supplements or restatements thereof) that the Managing Member
or any Liquidator deems appropriate or necessary to form, qualify or continue
the existence or qualification of the Company as a limited liability company
(or a company in which the members have limited liability to the extent
provided by applicable law) in the State of Delaware and in all other
jurisdictions in which the Company may conduct business or own property; (b)
all instruments that the Managing Member or any Liquidator deems appropriate
or necessary to reflect any amendment, change, modification or restatement of

Member or any Liquidator determines in its sole and absolute discretion are
appropriate, necessary or desirable to make, evidence, give, confirm or
ratify any vote, consent, approval, agreement or other action that is made or
given by the Members hereunder or is consistent with the terms of this
Agreement or to effectuate the terms or intent of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

Nothing contained herein shall be construed as authorizing the Managing Member
or any Liquidator to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Section
14.2 hereof or as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

B. The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and a
special power coupled with an interest, in recognition of the fact that each
of the Members and Assignees will be relying upon the power of the Managing
Member or any Liquidator to act as contemplated by this Agreement in any
filing or other action by it on behalf of the Company, and it shall survive
and not be affected by the subsequent Incapacity of any Member or Assignee and
the Transfer of all or any portion of such Persons Membership Units or
Membership Interest (as the case may be) and shall extend to such Persons
heirs, successors, assigns and personal representatives. Each such Member and
Assignee hereby agrees to be bound by any representation made by the Managing
Member or any Liquidator, acting in good faith pursuant to such power of
attorney; and each such Member and Assignee hereby waives any and all defenses
that may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of
the Managing Member or any Liquidator, taken in good faith under such power
of attorney. Each Member and Assignee shall execute and deliver to the
Managing Member or any Liquidator, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
the Managing Members or any Liquidators request therefor, such further
designation, powers of attorney and other instruments as the Managing Member
or any Liquidator (as the case may be) deems necessary to effectuate this
Agreement and the purposes of the Company. Notwithstanding anything else set
forth in this Section 2.4.B, no Member shall incur any personal liability for
any action of the Managing Member or any Liquidator taken under such power of
attorney.

provisions of Article 13 hereof or as otherwise provided by law.

PURPOSE 

Section 3.1 _Purpose and Business_. The purpose and nature of the Company is
to conduct any business, enterprise or activity permitted by or under the
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that such business and arrangements and
interests shall be limited to and conducted in such a manner as to permit the
Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion, at all times to be
classified as a REIT unless CLNS Credit, in its sole and absolute discretion,
has chosen to cease to qualify as a REIT or has chosen not to attempt to
qualify as a REIT for any reason or for reasons whether or not related to
the business conducted by the Company. Without limiting CLNS Credits right
in its sole and absolute discretion to cease qualifying as a REIT, the

 



27  Members acknowledge that the status of CLNS Credit as a REIT inures to the
benefit of all Members and not solely to CLNS Credit or its Affiliates. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company shall have full power and
authority to enter into, perform and carry out contracts of any kind, to
borrow and lend money and to issue and guarantee evidence of indebtedness,
whether or not secured by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or other lien and,
directly or indirectly, to acquire additional Properties necessary, useful or
desirable in connection with its business.

 

Section 3.2 _Powers_. The Company shall have the power to do any and all acts
and things necessary, appropriate, proper, advisable, incidental to or
convenient for the furtherance and accomplishment of the purposes and business
described herein and for the protection and benefit of the Company; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not take, and shall refrain from taking,
any action that, in the judgment of the Managing Member, in its sole and
absolute discretion, (i) could adversely affect the ability of CLNS Credit to
continue to qualify as a REIT, (ii) could cause the Company not to be treated
as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, (iii)
could subject CLNS Credit to any additional taxes under Code Section 857 or
Code Section 4981 or any other related or successor provision of the Code or
(iv) could violate any law or regulation of any governmental body or agency
having jurisdiction over CLNS Credit, its securities or the Company.

 

Section 3.3 _Limited Authority and Liability of Members_. The Company is a
limited liability company formed pursuant to the Act, and this Agreement
shall not be deemed to create a company, venture or partnership between or
among the Members or any other Persons with respect to any activities
whatsoever other than the activities specified in Section 3.1 hereof. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Member shall have any authority
to act for, bind, commit or assume any obligation or responsibility on behalf
of the Company, its properties or any other Member. No Member, in its capacity
as a Member under this Agreement, shall be responsible or liable for any
indebtedness or obligation of another Member, nor shall the Company be
responsible or liable for any indebtedness or obligation of any Member,
incurred either before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by such Member, except as to those responsibilities, liabilities, indebtedness
or obligations incurred pursuant to and as limited by the terms of this
Agreement and the Act.

distributing such interest or any part thereof at any particular time or
under any predetermined circumstances. Each Member further represents and
warrants that it is a sophisticated investor, able and accustomed to handling

the Company) and the dissolution, liquidation and termination of the
Company.

any employee or representative or Affiliate of any Member, and

any Additional Member or Substituted Member or any transferee of either);
_provided_ that such representations and warranties, as modified, shall be
set forth in either (i) a Membership Unit Designation applicable to the
Membership Units held by such Member or (ii) a separate writing addressed to
the Company and the Managing Member.

 

ARTICLE 4

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Section 4.1 _Capital Contributions of the Members_. Each Member has previously
made Capital Contributions to the Company. Immediately upon execution of this
Agreement, all existing limited liability company interests of the Company
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement automatically shall be converted into Membership Common Units as
set forth in the Register. Except as provided by law or in Section 4.2, 4.3,
10.3.C or 10.4 hereof, the Members shall have no obligation or, except with
the prior written consent of the Managing Member, right to make any Capital
Contributions or loans to the Company.

Section 4.2 _Issuances of Additional Membership Interests_. Subject to
the rights of any Holder of any Membership Interest set forth in a Membership
Unit Designation:

A. _General_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement (including Section
4.2.B hereof), the Managing Member is hereby authorized to cause the Company
to issue additional Membership Interests, in the form of Membership Units, for
any Company purpose (including if the Managing Member determines that the
Company requires Additional Funds), at any time or from time to time, to the
Members (including the Managing Member and CLNS Credit) or to other Persons,
and to admit such Persons as Additional Members, for such consideration and
on such terms and conditions as shall be established by the Managing Member,
all without the approval of any Member or any other Person. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Managing Member is expressly authorized to cause
the Company to issue Membership Units (i) upon the conversion, redemption or
exchange of any Debt, Membership Units or other securities issued by the
Company, (ii) for less than fair market value, (iii) for no consideration,
(iv) in connection with any merger of any other Person into the Company, or
(v) upon the contribution of property or assets to the Company. Any additional
Membership Interests may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more
series of any of such classes, with such designations, preferences,
conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption
(including rights that may be senior or otherwise entitled to preference over
existing Membership Interests) as shall be determined by the Managing Member,
in its sole and absolute discretion and without the approval of any Non-
Managing Member or any other Person, and set forth in a written document
thereafter attached to and made an exhibit to this Agreement, which exhibit
shall be an amendment to this Agreement and shall be incorporated herein by
this reference (each, a " _Membership Unit Designation_ ") without the
approval of any Non-Managing Member or any other Person. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Managing Member shall have 

 



31  authority to specify, in its sole and absolute discretion: (a) the
allocations of items of Company income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to
each such class or series of Membership Interests; (b) the right of each such
class or series of Membership Interests to share (on a pari passu, junior or
preferred basis) in Membership Unit Distributions; (c) the rights of each such
class or series of Membership Interests upon dissolution and liquidation of
the Company; (d) the voting rights, if any, of each such class or series of
Membership Interests; and (e) the conversion, redemption or exchange rights
applicable to each such class or series of Membership Interests. Except to
the extent specifically set forth in any Membership Unit Designation, a
Membership Interest of any class or series other than a Membership Common Unit
shall not entitle the holder thereof to vote on, or consent to, any
matter. Upon the issuance of any additional Membership Interest, the Managing
Member shall update the Register and the books and records of the Company as
appropriate to reflect such issuance.

 

B. _Issuances to CLNS Credit_. No additional Membership Units shall be issued
to CLNS Credit unless (i) the additional Membership Units are issued to all
Members holding Membership Common Units in proportion to their respective
Percentage Interests in the Membership Common Units, (ii) (a) the additional
Membership Units are (x) Membership Common Units issued in connection with an
issuance of REIT Shares, or (y) Company Equivalent Units (other than
Membership Common Units) issued in connection with an issuance of Capital
Shares, Preferred Shares, New Securities or other interests in CLNS Credit
(other than REIT Shares), and (b) CLNS Credit contributes to the Company the
cash proceeds or other consideration received in connection with the issuance
of such REIT Shares, Capital Shares, Preferred Shares, New Securities or other
interests in CLNS Credit, (iii) the additional Membership Units are issued
upon the conversion, redemption or exchange of Debt, Membership Units or other
securities issued by the Company, or (iv) the additional Membership Units are
issued pursuant to Section 4.2.D, Section 4.4, Section 4.7, Section 4.9 or
Section 4.11; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained in this Agreement but subject to the rights of any
Holder of any Membership Interest set forth in a Membership Unit Designation,
the Company shall not issue, and the Managing Member shall not authorize the
issuance of, (x) any Membership Interests to CLNS Credit that do not have CLNS
Credit Equivalent Shares that are concurrently issued by CLNS Credit for the
equivalent contribution to CLNS Credit of cash, property or assets, which are
subsequently contributed by CLNS Credit to the Company, or (y) any Membership
Interests to any Person other than CLNS Credit unless approved by the Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

C. _No Preemptive Rights_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or
in any Membership Unit Designation, no Person, including any Member or
Assignee, shall have any preemptive, preferential, participation or similar
right or rights to subscribe for or acquire any Membership Interest.

D. _Issuance of Securities by CLNS Credit_. CLNS Credit shall not issue any
additional REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New Securities unless CLNS Credit
contributes, substantially concurrently with the receipt thereof, the cash
proceeds or other consideration received from the issuance of such additional
REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New Securities (as the case may be), and
from the exercise of the rights contained in any such additional New
Securities, to the Company in exchange for (x) in the case of an issuance of
REIT Shares,

 



32  Membership Common Units, or (y) in the case of an issuance of Preferred
Shares or New Securities, Company Equivalent Units; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, CLNS Credit may issue REIT Shares,
Preferred Shares or New Securities (a) pursuant to Section 4.4, Section 15.1.B
or Section 15.1.J hereof, (b) pursuant to a dividend or distribution
(including any stock split) of REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New
Securities to all holders of REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New Securities
(as the case may be), (c) upon a conversion, redemption or exchange of
Preferred Shares, (d) upon a conversion, redemption, exchange or exercise of
New Securities, (e) upon a conversion, redemption, exchange of any Funding
Debt into REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New Securities, or (f) in
connection with an acquisition of Membership Units or a property or other
asset to be owned, directly or indirectly, by CLNS Credit. In the event of any
issuance of additional REIT Shares, Preferred Shares or New Securities by CLNS
Credit, and the contribution to the Company, by CLNS Credit, of the cash
proceeds or other consideration received from such issuance, the Company
shall pay CLNS Credits expenses associated with such issuance, including any
underwriting discounts or commissions. In the event that CLNS Credit issues
any additional REIT Shares, Capital Shares, Preferred Shares, New Securities
or other interests in CLNS Credit and contributes the cash proceeds or other
consideration received from the issuance thereof to the Company, the Company
is authorized to and shall issue a number of Membership Common Units or
Company Equivalent Units to CLNS Credit equal to the number of REIT Shares,
Capital Shares, Preferred Shares, New Securities or other interests so issued,
_divided_ _by_ the Adjustment Factor then in effect, in accordance with this
Section 4.3.D without any further act, approval or vote of any Member or any
other Persons; _provided_ that CLNS Credit shall have the discretion to not
divide the Capital Shares, Preferred Shares, New Securities or other
interests by the Adjustment Factor for purposes of determining the number of
Membership Common Units or Company Equivalent Units to be issued to CLNS
Credit if CLNS Credit determines that to do so would not be appropriate.

 

E. _Register_. The Managing Member shall cause to be maintained in the
principal business office of the Company, or such other place as may be
determined by the Managing Member, the books and records of the Company, which
shall include, among other things, a register containing the name, address and
number of Membership Units of each Member, and such other information as
the Managing Member may deem necessary or desirable (the " _Register_ "). The
Register shall not be deemed part of this Agreement. The Managing Member shall
from time to time update the Register as necessary to accurately reflect
the information therein, including as a result of any sales, exchanges or
other Transfers, or any redemptions, issuances or similar events involving
Membership Units. Any reference in this Agreement to the Register shall be
deemed a reference to the Register as in effect from time to time. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, the Managing Member may take any action
authorized hereunder in respect of the Register without any need to obtain the
consent of any other Member. No action of any Non-Managing Member shall be
required to amend or update the Register. Except as required by law, no Non-
Managing Member shall be entitled to receive a copy of the information set
forth in the Register relating to any Member other than itself. Schedule I
hereto sets forth the respective Capital Accounts of the Members as of the
date hereof.

 



33 Section 4.3 _Loans to the Company_.

 

A. _Loans by Third Parties_. The Managing Member, on behalf of the Company,
may obtain any Additional Funds, without the approval of any Member or any
other Person, by causing the Company to incur Debt to any Person (other than,
except as contemplated in Section 4.3.B, the Managing Member or CLNS Credit)
upon such terms as the Managing Member determines appropriate,
including making such Debt convertible, redeemable or exchangeable for
Membership Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not incur
any such Debt if any Member would be personally liable for the repayment of
such Debt (unless such Member otherwise agrees).

B. _Loans by the Managing Member_. The Managing Member, in its sole and
absolute discretion on behalf of the Company, may obtain any Additional Funds
by causing the Company to incur Debt to the Managing Member and/or CLNS Credit
(each, a " _CLNS Credit Member Loan_ ") if (i) such Debt is, to the extent
permitted by law, on substantially the same terms and conditions (including
interest rate, repayment schedule, and conversion, redemption, repurchase and
exchange rights) as Funding Debt incurred by the Managing Member or CLNS
Credit, as applicable, the net proceeds of which are loaned to the Company to
provide such Additional Funds, or (ii) such Debt is on terms and conditions no
less favorable to the Company than would be available to the Company from a
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not incur any
such Debt if any Member would be personally liable for the repayment of such
Debt (unless such Member otherwise agrees).

 

Section 4.4 _Stock Incentive Plans_.

 

A. _Options Granted to Persons other than Company Employees_. If at any time
or from time to time, in connection with any Stock Incentive Plan, an option
to purchase REIT Shares granted to a Person other than a Company Employee is
duly exercised:



     | (1) | CLNS Credit shall, as soon as practicable after such
exercise, make a Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to the
exercise price paid to CLNS Credit by such exercising party in connection with
the exercise of such stock option. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | Notwithstanding the amount of the Capital Contribution
actually made pursuant to Section 4.4.A(1) hereof, CLNS Credit shall be deemed
to have contributed to the Company as a Capital Contribution an amount equal
to the Value of a REIT Share as of the date of exercise, _multiplied_ _by_
the number of REIT Shares then being issued in connection with the exercise of
such stock option. In exchange for such Capital Contribution, the Company
shall issue a number of Membership Common Units to CLNS Credit equal to the
quotient of (a) the number of REIT Shares issued in connection with the
exercise of such stock option, _divided_ _by_ (b) the Adjustment Factor then
in effect.  
---|---|--- 
 



34 B. _Options Granted to Company Employees_. If at any time or from time to
time, in connection with any Stock Incentive Plan, an option to purchase REIT
Shares granted to a Company Employee is duly exercised:



     | (1) | CLNS Credit shall sell to the Company, and the Company shall
purchase from CLNS Credit, the number of REIT Shares as to which such stock
option is being exercised. The purchase price per REIT Share for such sale of
REIT Shares to the Company shall be the Value of a REIT Share as of the date
of exercise of such stock option. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | The Company shall sell to the Optionee (or if the Optionee
is an employee of a Company Subsidiary, the Company shall sell to such Company
Subsidiary, which in turn shall sell to the Optionee), for a cash price per
share equal to the Value of a REIT Share at the time of the exercise, a
number of REIT Shares equal to (a) the exercise price paid to CLNS Credit by
the exercising party in connection with the exercise of such stock option,
_divided_ _by_  (b) the Value of a REIT Share at the time of such exercise. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | The Company shall transfer to the Optionee (or if the
Optionee is an employee of a Company Subsidiary, the Company shall transfer to
such Company Subsidiary, which in turn shall transfer to the Optionee) at
no additional cost, as additional compensation, a number of REIT Shares equal
to the number of REIT Shares described in Section 4.4.B(1) hereof, _less_ the
number of REIT Shares described in Section 4.4.B(2) hereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) | CLNS Credit shall, as soon as practicable after such
exercise, make a Capital Contribution to the Company of an amount equal to the
proceeds received (excluding any payment in respect of payroll taxes or
other withholdings) by CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 4.4.B(1) in connection
with the exercise of such stock option. In exchange for such Capital
Contribution, the Company shall issue a number of Membership Common Units to
CLNS Credit equal to the quotient of (a) the number of REIT Shares issued in
connection with the exercise of such stock option, _divided_ _by_ (b) the
Adjustment Factor then in effect. 
---|---|--- 
 

C. _Restricted Stock Granted to Company Employees_. If at any time or from
time to time, in connection with any Equity Plan (other than a Stock
Incentive Plan), any REIT Shares are issued to a Company Employee (including
any REIT Shares that are subject to forfeiture in the event such Company
Employee terminates his employment by the Company or a Company Subsidiary) in
consideration for services performed for the Company or a Company Subsidiary:

 



35 are to be issued to the Company Employee in accordance with the Equity Plan; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | the following events will be deemed to have occurred: (a)
CLNS Credit shall be deemed to have sold such shares to the Company (or if the
Company Employee is an employee or other service provider of a
Company Subsidiary, to such Company Subsidiary) for a purchase price equal to
the Value of such shares, (b) the Company (or such Company Subsidiary) shall
be deemed to have delivered the shares to the Company Employee, (c) CLNS
Credit shall be deemed to have contributed the purchase price to the Company
as a Capital Contribution, and (d) if the Company Employee is an employee of a
Company Subsidiary, the Company shall be deemed to have contributed such
amount to the capital of the Company Subsidiary; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | the Company shall issue to CLNS Credit a number of
Membership Common Units equal to the number of newly issued REIT Shares,
_divided_ _by_ the Adjustment Factor then in effect, in consideration for the
deemed Capital Contribution pursuant to Section 4.4.C.(2)(c). 
---|---|--- 

D. _Restricted Stock Granted to Persons other than Company Employees_. If at
any time or from time to time, in connection with any Equity Plan (other than
a Stock Incentive Plan), any REIT Shares are issued to a Person other than a
Company Employee in consideration for services performed for CLNS Credit, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary:



     | (1) | CLNS Credit shall issue such number of REIT Shares as are to
be issued to such Person in accordance with the Equity Plan; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | CLNS Credit shall be deemed to have contributed the Value of
such REIT Shares to the Company as a Capital Contribution, and the Company
shall issue to CLNS Credit a number of newly issued Membership Common Units
equal to the number of newly issued REIT Shares, _divided_ _by_ the
Adjustment Factor then in effect. 
---|---|--- 

E. _Future Stock Incentive Plans_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed or applied to preclude or restrain the Managing Member or CLNS
Credit from adopting, modifying or terminating stock incentive plans for the
benefit of employees, directors or other business associates of the Managing
Member, CLNS Credit, the Company or any of their Affiliates. The Members
acknowledge and agree that, in the event that any such plan is adopted,
modified or terminated by the Managing Member or CLNS Credit, amendments to
this Section 4.4 may become necessary or advisable and that any approval or
Consent to any such amendments requested by the Managing Member or CLNS Credit
shall be deemed granted.

 



36 F. _Issuance of Membership Common Units_. The Company is expressly authorized
to issue Membership Common Units in the circumstances specified in this
Section 4.4 without any further act, approval or vote of any Member or any
other Persons.

 

Section 4.5 _LTIP Units_.

 

A. _Issuance of LTIP Units_. The Managing Member may from time to time issue
LTIP Units, in one or more classes or series established in accordance with
Section 4.2, to Persons who provide services to the Company, for such
consideration as the Managing Member may determine to be appropriate, and
admit such Persons as Members. Any provision herein relating to LTIP Units or
LTIP Unitholders may be varied by the provisions applicable to an individual
class or series of LTIP Units as set forth in the applicable Membership Unit
Designation. Except to the extent a Capital Contribution is made with respect
to an LTIP Unit, each LTIP Unit is intended to qualify as a "profits
interest" in the Company within the meaning of the Code, the Regulations, and
any published guidance by the IRS with respect thereto. Subject to the
following provisions of this Section 4.5 and the special provisions of
Sections 4.6, 5.7 and 6.3.E, LTIP Units shall be treated as Membership Common
Units, with all of the rights, privileges and obligations attendant thereto.
For purposes of computing the Members Percentage Interests, holders of LTIP
Units shall be treated as holders of Membership Common Units and LTIP Units
shall be treated as Membership Common Units. In particular, the Company shall
maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and
Membership Common Units for conversion, distribution and other purposes,
including complying with the following procedures:

 



     | (i) |

If an Adjustment Event occurs, then except as set forth in the applicable
Membership Unit Designation, the Managing Member shall make a corresponding
adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence between
Membership Common Units and LTIP Units as existed prior to such Adjustment
Event. " _Adjustment Events_ " means any of the following events: (a) the
Company makes a distribution on all outstanding Membership Common Units in
Membership Units to the extent the LTIP Unitholder did not participate in the
distribution; (b) the Company subdivides the outstanding Membership Common
Units into a greater number of units or combines the outstanding Membership
Common Units into a smaller number of units; or (c) the Company issues any
Membership Units in exchange for its outstanding Membership Common Units by
way of a reclassification or recapitalization of its Membership Common Units.
If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units
need be made only once using a single formula that takes into account each and
every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously.
For the avoidance of doubt, the following shall not be Adjustment Events: (x)
the issuance of Membership Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition
or other similar business transaction; (y) the issuance of Membership Units
pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation plan or distribution
reinvestment plan; or (z) the issuance of any Membership Units to the 

---|---|--- 
 



37 Company of proceeds from the sale of securities by the Managing Member. If the
Company takes an action affecting the Membership Common Units or LTIP Units
other than actions specifically described above as Adjustment Events and in
the opinion of the Managing Member such action would require an adjustment to
the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described above, the
Managing Member shall have the right to make such adjustment to the LTIP
Units, to the extent permitted by law and by any Equity Plan, in such manner
and at such time as the Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment is
made to the LTIP Units as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file in
the books and records of the Company an officers certificate setting forth
such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment,
which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such
adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after the filing of such
certificate, the Company shall mail a notice to each LTIP Unitholder setting
forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP Units and the effective date of such
adjustment. 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | Unless otherwise provided in an LTIP Award or Vesting
Agreement or by the Managing Member with respect to any particular class or
series of LTIP Units, the LTIP Unitholders shall, when, as and if authorized
and declared by the Managing Member out of assets legally available for that
purpose, be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per LTIP Unit equal
to the distributions per Membership Common Unit (the " _Membership Unit
Distribution_ "), paid to holders of Membership Common Units on such Company
Record Date established by the Managing Member with respect to such
distribution; _provided_ , _however_ , that until the Economic Capital Account
Balance of the LTIP Units is equal to the Target Balance, the LTIP Units
shall be entitled to distributions attributable to the sale or other
disposition of an asset of the Company only to the extent of any appreciation
in value of such asset subsequent to the award date of such LTIP Unit, as
determined by the Company. Subject to the terms of any LTIP Award or Vesting
Agreement or as determined by the Managing Member with respect to any
particular class or series of LTIP Units, so long as any LTIP Units are
outstanding, no distributions (whether in cash or in kind) shall be
authorized, declared or paid on Membership Common Units, unless equal
distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid
on the LTIP Units in accordance with the preceding sentence. Subject to the
terms of any LTIP Award or Vesting Agreement, or as determined by the Managing
Member with respect to any particular class or series of LTIP Units, an LTIP
Unitholder shall be entitled to transfer his or her Vested LTIP Units to the
same extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of Membership
Common Units are entitled to transfer their Membership Common Units pursuant
to Article 11 of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



38 B. _Priority_. Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.5 and the special
provisions of Section 6.3.E, the LTIP Units shall rank _pari passu_ with the
Membership Common Units as to the payment of regular and special periodic or
other distributions and, subject to Sections 13.2.A(2) and 13.2.C,
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the
payment of distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Membership Units or
Membership Interests which by its terms specifies that it shall rank junior
to, on a parity with, or senior to the Membership Common Units shall also rank
junior to, or _pari passu_ with, or senior to, as the case may be, the LTIP
Units.

 

C. _Special Provisions_. LTIP Units shall be subject to the following special
provisions:

 



     | (i) | _Vesting Agreements_. LTIP Units may, in the sole and
absolute discretion of the Managing Member, be issued subject to vesting,
forfeiture and additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the terms of a
Vesting Agreement. The terms of any Vesting Agreement may be modified by the
Managing Member from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion, subject
to any restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement or
by the Equity Plan, if applicable. LTIP Units that have vested under the
terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to as " _Vested LTIP Units_ ;" all
other LTIP Units shall be treated as " _Unvested LTIP Units_." 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _Forfeiture_. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting
Agreement, upon the occurrence of any event specified in a Vesting Agreement
as resulting in either the right of the Company or the Managing Member
to repurchase LTIP Units at a specified purchase price or some other
forfeiture of any LTIP Units, then if the Company or the Managing Member
exercises such right to repurchase or forfeiture in accordance with the
applicable Vesting Agreement, the relevant LTIP Units shall immediately, and
without any further action, be treated as cancelled and no longer outstanding
for any purpose. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, no
consideration or other payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units
that have been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with respect
to a Company Record Date prior to the effective date of the forfeiture. In
connection with any repurchase or forfeiture of LTIP Units, the balance of
the portion of the Capital Account of the LTIP Unitholder that is attributable
to all of its LTIP Units shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which such
balance exceeds the Target Balance contemplated by Section 6.3.E, calculated
with respect to the LTIP Unitholders remaining LTIP Units, if any. 
---|---|--- 
 



39 certain special allocations of gain under Section 6.3.E. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _Redemption_. The Redemption right provided to Members
under Section 15.1 shall not apply with respect to LTIP Units unless and until
they are converted to Membership Common Units as provided in clause (v) below
and Section 4.6. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | _Conversion to Membership Common Units_. Vested LTIP Units
are eligible to be converted into Membership Common Units under Section 4.6. 
---|---|--- 
 

D. _Voting_. Unless otherwise provided in an LTIP Award or Vesting Agreement
or by the Managing Member with respect to any particular class or series of
LTIP Units, LTIP Unitholders shall (a) have those voting rights required from
time to time by applicable law, if any, (b) have the same voting rights as a
holder of Membership Common Units with respect to their LTIP Units, with the
LTIP Units voting together as a single class with the Membership Common Units
and having one vote per LTIP Unit and (c) have the additional voting rights
that are expressly set forth below. Unless otherwise provided in an
LTIP Award or Vesting Agreement or by the Managing Member with respect to any
particular class or series of LTIP Units, so long as any LTIP Units remain
outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the LTIP Units outstanding at the time that
would be adversely affected by the proposed action, given in person or by
proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class),
amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to LTIP Units as such so as to
materially and adversely affect any right, privilege or voting power of the
LTIP Units or the LTIP Unitholders as such, unless such
amendment, alteration, or repeal affects equally, ratably and proportionately
in all material respects the rights, privileges and voting powers of the
holders of Membership Common Units; but subject, in any event, to the
following provisions:

 



     | (i) | With respect to any Transaction, so long as the LTIP Units
are treated in accordance with Section 4.6.F hereof, the consummation of such
Transaction shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect
such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or
the LTIP Unitholders as such; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Any creation or issuance of any Membership Units or of any
class or series of Membership Interest, including additional Membership Common
Units, LTIP Units or Company Preferred Units, whether ranking senior to,
junior to, or on a parity with the LTIP Units with respect to distributions
and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP
Unitholders as such. 
---|---|--- 
 



40 The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will
be effected, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted into
Membership Common Units.

 

Section 4.6 _Conversion of LTIP Units_.

 

A. Unless otherwise provided in an LTIP Award or Vesting Agreement or by the
Managing Member with respect to any particular class or series of LTIP Units,
an LTIP Unitholder shall have the right (the " _Conversion Right_ "), at its
option, at any time to convert all or a portion of its Vested LTIP Units into
Membership Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that a holder may not
exercise the Conversion Right for less than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP
Units or, if such holder holds less than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP
Units, all of the Vested LTIP Units held by such holder. LTIP Unitholders
shall not have the right to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Membership
Common Units until they become Vested LTIP Units; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that when an LTIP Unitholder is notified of the expected occurrence of an
event that will cause his or her Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP
Units, such LTIP Unitholder may give the Company a Conversion Notice
conditioned upon and effective as of the time of vesting and such Conversion
Notice, unless subsequently revoked by the LTIP Unitholder, shall be accepted
by the Company subject to such condition. In all cases, the conversion of any
LTIP Units into Membership Common Units shall be subject to the conditions and
procedures set forth in this Section 4.6.

 

B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder of Vested LTIP
Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that exceeds (x) the Economic
Capital Account Balance of such Member, to the extent attributable to its
ownership of Vested LTIP Units, divided by (y) the Membership Common Unit
Economic Balance, in each case as determined as of the effective date of
conversion (the " _Capital Account Limitation_ "). In order to exercise his
or her Conversion Right, an LTIP Unitholder shall deliver a notice (a "
_Conversion Notice_ ") in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ to the Company
(with a copy to the Managing Member) not less than 10 nor more than 60 days
prior to a date (the " _Conversion Date_ ") specified in such Conversion
Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Managing Member has not given to
the LTIP Unitholders notice of a proposed or upcoming Transaction (as defined
below in Section 4.6.F) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such
Transaction, then LTIP Unitholders shall have the right to deliver a
Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x) the 10th day after such notice
from the Managing Member of a Transaction or (y) the third business day
immediately preceding the effective date of such Transaction. A Conversion
Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in Section 15.2. Each LTIP
Unitholder covenants and agrees with the Company that all Vested LTIP Units to
be converted pursuant to this Section 4.6.B shall be free and clear of all
liens. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a holder of LTIP
Units may deliver a Notice of Redemption pursuant to Section 15.1.A relating
to those Membership Common Units that will be issued to such holder upon
conversion of such LTIP Units into Membership Common Units in advance of the
Conversion Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the redemption of such
Membership Common Units by the Company shall in no event take place until
after the Conversion Date. For clarity, it is noted that the objective of
this paragraph is to put an LTIP Unitholder in a position where, if he or she
so wishes, the Membership Common Units into which his or her Vested LTIP Units
will be converted can be redeemed by the Company 

 



41  simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence that, if
the Managing Member elects to assume the Companys redemption obligation with
respect to such Membership Common Units under Section 15.1.B by delivering to
such holder Class A REIT Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have
such Class A REIT Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the
conversion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Membership Common Units. The
Managing Member shall reasonably cooperate with an LTIP Unitholder to
coordinate the timing of the different events described in the foregoing
sentence.

 

C. The Company, at any time at the election of the Managing Member in its sole
and absolute discretion, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by an
LTIP Unitholder to be converted (a " _Forced Redemption_ ") into an equal
number of Membership Common Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any)
made pursuant to Section 4.5; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
not cause a Forced Redemption of any LTIP Units that would not at the time be
eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP Unitholder pursuant to
Section 4.6.B. In order to exercise its right of Forced Redemption,
the Company shall deliver a notice (a " _Forced Redemption Notice_ ") in the
form attached as _Exhibit D_ to the applicable LTIP Unitholder not less than
ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the Conversion Date specified
in such Forced Redemption Notice. A Forced Redemption Notice shall be provided
in the manner provided in Section 15.2.

D. A conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which the holder thereof has given a
Conversion Notice or the Company has given a Forced Redemption Notice shall
occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable Conversion
Date without any action on the part of such LTIP Unitholder, as of which time
such LTIP Unitholder shall be credited on the books and records of the Company
with the issuance as of the opening of business on the next day of the number
of Membership Common Units issuable upon such conversion. After the
conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the Company shall deliver to such LTIP
Unitholder, upon his or her written request, a certificate of the Managing
Member certifying the number of Membership Common Units and remaining LTIP
Units, if any, held by such person immediately after such conversion. The
Assignee of any Member pursuant to Article 11 hereof may exercise the rights
of such Member pursuant to this Section 4.6 and such Member shall be bound
by the exercise of such rights by the Assignee.

E. For purposes of making future allocations under Section 6.3.E and applying
the Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account
Balance of the applicable LTIP Unitholder that is treated as attributable to
his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the
product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Membership Common Unit
Economic Balance.

F. If the Company or the Managing Member shall be a party to any transaction
(including a merger, consolidation, unit exchange, self-tender offer for all
or substantially all Membership Common Units or other business combination or
reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the Companys
assets, but excluding any transaction which constitutes an Adjustment Event)
in each case as a result of which Membership Common Units shall be exchanged
for or converted into the right, or the holders of such Membership Common
Units shall otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other
property or any combination

 



42  thereof (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a " _Transaction_
"), then the Managing Member shall, immediately prior to the consummation of
the Transaction, exercise its right to cause a Forced Redemption with respect
to the maximum number of LTIP Units then eligible for conversion, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the Transaction or that
would occur in connection with the Transaction if the assets of the Company
were sold at the Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value determined by
the Managing Member in good faith using the value attributed to the Membership
Common Units in the context of the Transaction (in which case the Conversion
Date shall be the effective date of the Transaction). In anticipation of such
Forced Redemption and the consummation of the Transaction, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each LTIP Unitholder to be
afforded the right to receive in connection with such Transaction in
consideration for the Membership Common Units into which his or her LTIP Units
will be converted the same kind and amount of cash, securities and other
property (or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of
such Transaction by a holder of the same number of Membership Common Units,
assuming such holder of Membership Common Units is not a Person with which the
Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into
the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a
" _Constituent Person_ "), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the
event that holders of Membership Common Units have the opportunity to elect
the form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the
Transaction, prior to such Transaction the Managing Member shall give prompt
written notice to each LTIP Unitholder of such election, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to afford the LTIP Unitholders the right to
elect, by written notice to the Managing Member, the form or type of
consideration to be received upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by such
holder into Membership Common Units in connection with such Transaction. If
an LTIP Unitholder fails to make such an election, such holder (and any of its
transferees) shall receive upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by him or
her (or by any of his or her transferees) the same kind and amount of
consideration that a holder of a Membership Common Unit would receive if such
Membership Common Unit holder failed to make such an election. Subject to the
rights of the Company and the Managing Member under any Vesting Agreement and
any Equity Plan, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the terms of any Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of
this Section 4.6.F and to enter into an agreement with the successor or
purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of any LTIP Unitholders
whose LTIP Units will not be converted into Membership Common Units in
connection with the Transaction that will (i) contain provisions enabling the
holders of LTIP Units that remain outstanding after such Transaction to
convert their LTIP Units into securities as comparable as reasonably possible
under the circumstances to the Membership Common Units and (ii) preserve as
far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the distribution, special
allocation, conversion, and other rights set forth in this Agreement for the
benefit of the LTIP Unitholders.

 

Section 4.7 _Dividend Reinvestment Plan, Stock Incentive Plan or Other Plan_.
Except as may otherwise be provided in this Article 4, all amounts retained
or deemed received by CLNS Credit in respect of any dividend reinvestment
plan, stock incentive or other stock or subscription plan or agreement, either
(a) shall be utilized by CLNS Credit to effect open market purchases of REIT
Shares, or (b) shall be contributed by CLNS Credit to the Company in exchange
for additional Membership Common Units and, upon such contribution, the
Company will issue to CLNS Credit a number of Membership Common Units equal
to the number of newly issued REIT Shares, _divided_ _by_ the Adjustment
Factor then in effect without any further act, approval or vote of any Member
or any other Person.

 



43 Section 4.8 _No Interest; No Return_. No Member shall be entitled to interest
on its Capital Contribution or on such Members Capital Account. Except as
provided herein or by law, no Member shall have any right to demand or receive
the return of its Capital Contribution from the Company.

 

Section 4.9 _Conversion or Redemption of Preferred Shares; Redemption of REIT
Shares_.

 

A. _Conversion of Preferred Shares_. If, at any time, any Preferred Shares are
converted into REIT Shares, in whole or in part, then an equal number of
Company Equivalent Units held by CLNS Credit that correspond to the class or
series of Preferred Shares so converted shall automatically be converted into
a number of Membership Common Units equal to the quotient of (i) the number
of REIT Shares issued upon such conversion, _divided_ _by_ (ii) the Adjustment
Factor then in effect.

B.  _Redemption of Preferred Shares_. If, at any time, any Preferred Shares
are redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired (whether by exercise of a put
or call, automatically or by means of another arrangement) by CLNS Credit for
cash, then, immediately prior to such redemption of Preferred Shares, the
Company shall redeem an equal number of Company Equivalent Units held by CLNS
Credit that correspond to the class or series of Preferred Shares so redeemed,
repurchased or acquired upon the same terms and for the same price per
Company Equivalent Unit, as such Preferred Shares are redeemed, repurchased or
acquired.

C.  _Redemption, Repurchase or Forfeiture of REIT Shares_. If, at any time,
any REIT Shares are redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired (whether by
exercise of a put or call, upon forfeiture of any award granted under any
Equity Plan, automatically or by means of another arrangement, including
pursuant to any Non-Managing Member Ancillary Agreement) by CLNS Credit (other
than repurchases contemplated by Section 4.7), then, immediately prior to
such redemption, repurchase or acquisition of REIT Shares, the Company shall
redeem a number of Membership Common Units held directly or indirectly by CLNS
Credit equal to the quotient of (i) the number of REIT Shares so
redeemed, repurchased or acquired, divided by (ii) the Adjustment Factor then
in effect, such redemption, repurchase or acquisition to be upon the same
terms and for the same price per Membership Common Unit (after giving effect
to application of the Adjustment Factor) as such REIT Shares are redeemed,
repurchased or acquired.

Section 4.10 _Other Contribution Provisions_. In the event that any Member is
admitted to the Company and is given a Capital Account in exchange for
services rendered to the Company, such transaction shall be treated by the
Company and the affected Member as if the Company had compensated such Member
in cash and such Member had contributed the cash to the capital of the
Company. In addition, with the consent of the Managing Member, one or more
Members (including CLNS Credit) may enter into contribution agreements with
the Company which have the effect of providing a guarantee of certain
obligations of the Company.

 



44 Section 4.11 _Excluded Properties_. CLNS Credit shall contribute each Excluded
Property (or, if applicable, the net proceeds (after payment of all transfer
taxes and other transaction costs) received by CLNS Credit from the sale,
transfer or other disposition of an Excluded Property to a Person who is not a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit) to the Company
upon the earlier of (i) such time as it is commercially practicable to
contribute such property to the Company without adverse tax or other economic
consequence to CLNS Credit, and (ii) any sale, transfer or other disposition
of an Excluded Property to a Person who is not a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit. Upon any such contribution of an Excluded
Property or the proceeds therefrom, CLNS Credit shall receive in exchange for
such contribution, notwithstanding the actual value of such Excluded Property
or the amount of such proceeds (as the case may be), the Specified Membership
Units applicable to such Excluded Property. The Company is
expressly authorized to issue the Specified Membership Units in the numbers
specified in this Section 4.11 without any further act, approval or vote of
any Member or any other Persons.

 

ARTICLE 5

DISTRIBUTIONS 

Section 5.1 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions_. Subject to
the terms of any Membership Unit Designation that provides for a class or
series of Company Preferred Units with a preference with respect to the
payment of distributions, the Managing Member shall cause the Company to
distribute quarterly all, or such portion as the Managing Member
may determine, of the Available Cash generated by the Company during such
quarter to the Holders of Membership Common Units in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests of Membership Common Units on such Company
Record Date. Except as otherwise agreed by the Managing Member, distributions
payable with respect to any Membership Units that were not outstanding during
the entire quarterly period in respect of which any distribution is made
(other than any Membership Units issued to CLNS Credit in connection with the
issuance of REIT Shares) shall be prorated based on the portion of the period
that such Membership Units were outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion, may cause the
Company to distribute Available Cash to the Holders on a more or less frequent
basis than quarterly. The Managing Member shall make reasonable efforts to
cause the Company to distribute sufficient amounts to enable CLNS Credit, for
so long as CLNS Credit has determined to qualify as a REIT, to pay
stockholder dividends that will (a) satisfy the REIT Requirements, and (b)
eliminate any U.S. federal income or excise tax liability of CLNS Credit.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Excluded Property (or the proceeds
therefrom) has not been contributed to the Company pursuant to Section 4.11,
the distributions provided for above shall be calculated, to the extent
possible, based on Adjusted Available Cash as if each Excluded Property had
been contributed to the Company in exchange for the applicable
Specified Membership Units pursuant to Section 4.11, and any distributions to
be made with respect to CLNS Credits Membership Units shall in the aggregate
be reduced to the extent of any REIT Available Cash derived from such Excluded
Property.

  



45 Section 5.2 _Distributions in Kind_. No Holder may demand to receive property
other than cash as provided in this Agreement. The Managing Member may cause
the Company to make a distribution in kind of Company assets or Membership
Interests to the Holders, and such assets or Membership Interests shall be
distributed in such a fashion as to ensure that the fair market value is
distributed and allocated in accordance with Articles 5, 6 and 10 hereof.

 

Section 5.3 _Amounts Withheld_. All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or
any provisions of any state or local tax law or Section 10.3.C or Section
10.4 hereof with respect to any allocation, payment or distribution to any
Holder shall be treated as amounts paid or distributed to such Holder pursuant
to Section 5.1 hereof for all purposes under this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Distributions upon Liquidation_. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article 5, upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the
assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Holders in accordance with
Section 13.2 hereof.

 

Section 5.5 _Distributions to Reflect Additional Membership Units_. In the
event that the Company issues additional Membership Units pursuant to the
provisions of Article 4 hereof, subject to the rights of any Holder of any
Membership Interest set forth in a Membership Unit Designation, the Managing
Member is hereby authorized to make such revisions to this Article 5 and to
Article 6 as it determines are necessary or desirable to reflect the issuance
of such additional Membership Units, including making preferential
distributions to certain classes of Membership Units.

 

Section 5.6 _Restricted Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Managing
Member, on behalf of the Company, shall make a distribution to any Holder if
such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable law.

 

Section 5.7 _Restriction on Distributions with Respect to LTIP Units_. It is
the intention of the Members that distributions in respect of LTIP Units be
limited to the extent necessary so that each of the LTIP Units constitutes a
"profits interest" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In furtherance of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Managing Member shall, if necessary, limit distributions to the holders of
LTIP Units so that such distributions do not exceed the available profits in
respect of such LTIP Units (taking into account the special allocations
to LTIP Units provided in Section 6.3.E). In the event that distributions in
respect of LTIP Units are reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, an
amount equal to such excess distributions shall be treated as instead
apportioned to the remaining Members pro rata in accordance with their
Membership Common Units for the related Fiscal Year in accordance with the
other provisions of this Agreement, and the Managing Member shall make
adjustments to future distributions to the holders of LTIP Units as promptly
as practicable so that the holders of LTIP Units receive a distribution equal
to the amount they would have received, in each case as if this Section 5.7
had not been in effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that any distributions
pursuant to this sentence shall be further subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.7. For purposes of this Agreement, "profits interest" means a right
to receive distributions funded solely by profits of the Company generated
after the grant in connection with the performance of services, satisfying the
requirements as set forth in IRS Revenue Procedures 93-27 and 2001-43, or any
future IRS guidance or other authority that supplements or supersedes the
foregoing IRS Revenue Procedures.

ALLOCATIONS

 

Section 6.1 _Timing and Amount of Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_. Net
Income and Net Loss of the Company shall be determined and allocated with
respect to each Fiscal Year as of the end of each such year. Except as
otherwise provided in this Article 6, and subject to Section 11.6.C hereof, an
allocation to a Holder of a share of Net Income or Net Loss shall be treated
as an allocation of the same share of each item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is taken into account in computing Net Income or Net Loss.

 

Section 6.2 _General Allocations_.

 

A. _In General_. Subject to Section 11.6.C hereof, Net Income and Net Loss
shall be allocated to each of the Holders as follows:

 



     | (i) | Net Income will be allocated to Holders of Company Preferred
Units and Company Equivalent Units in accordance with and subject to the terms
of the Membership Unit Designation applicable to such Company Preferred
Units and Company Equivalent Units; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | remaining Net Income will be allocated to the Holders of
Membership Common Units (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the LTIP
Units) in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests at the end of
each Fiscal Year; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | subject to the terms of any Membership Unit Designation,
Net Loss will be allocated to the Holders of Membership Common Units
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the LTIP Units) in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests and to the holders of Company Preferred
Units and Company Equivalent Units in accordance with and subject to the terms
of the Membership Unit Designation applicable to such Company Equivalent Units
at the end of each Fiscal Year; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | for purposes of this Section 6.2.A, the Percentage
Interests of the Holders of Membership Common Units shall be calculated based
on a denominator equal to the aggregate Membership Common Units (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, LTIP Units) outstanding as of the date of
determination. 
---|---|--- 

Section 6.3 _Additional Allocation Provisions_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article 6:

A. _Special Allocations Regarding Company Preferred Units_. If any Company
Preferred Units are redeemed pursuant to Section 4.9.B hereof (treating a full
liquidation of the Managing Members Membership Interest or of CLNS Credits
Membership Interest for purposes of this Section 6.3.A as including a
redemption of any then outstanding Company Preferred Units pursuant to Section
4.9.B hereof), for the Fiscal Year that includes such

 



47  redemption (and, if necessary, for subsequent Fiscal Years) (a) gross income
and gain (in such relative proportions as the Managing Member shall determine)
shall be allocated to the holder(s) of such Company Preferred Units to the
extent that the Redemption amounts paid or payable with respect to the Company
Preferred Units so redeemed (or treated as redeemed) exceeds the aggregate
Capital Account balances (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by
the Company) per Company Preferred Unit allocable to the Company Preferred
Units so redeemed (or treated as redeemed) and (b) deductions and losses (in
such relative proportions as the Managing Member shall determine) shall be
allocated to the holder(s) of such Company Preferred Units to the extent that
the aggregate Capital Account balances (net of liabilities assumed or taken
subject to by the Company) per Company Preferred Unit allocable to
the Company Preferred Units so redeemed (or treated as redeemed) exceeds the
Redemption amount paid or payable with respect to the Company Preferred Units
so redeemed (or treated as redeemed).

 

B. _Regulatory Allocations_.



     | (i) | _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided in
Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2
hereof, or any other provision of this Article 6, if there is a net decrease
in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Holder shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holders share of the net
decrease in Member Minimum Gain, as determined under Regulations Section
1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in
proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Holder
pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be determined in accordance
with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section
6.3.B(i) is intended to qualify as a "minimum gain chargeback" within the
meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | _Member Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise
provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) or in Section 6.3.B(i) hereof,
if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain attributable to a Member
Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year, each Holder who has a share of the
Member Minimum Gain attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined
in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holders respective share of the
net decrease in Member Minimum Gain attributable to such Member Nonrecourse
Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4).
Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to
the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Holder pursuant
thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 6.3.B(ii)
is intended to qualify as a "chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum
gain," within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i), and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



48 Deductions_. Any Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially
allocated to the Holders in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests. Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be
specially allocated to the Holder(s) who bears the economic risk of loss with
respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse
Deductions are attributable, in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _Qualified Income Offset_. If any Holder unexpectedly
receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of Company income and gain
shall be allocated, in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), to such Holder in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by such Regulations, the Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit of such Holder as quickly as possible; _provided_ that an
allocation pursuant to this Section 6.3.B(iv) shall be made if and only to the
extent that such Holder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after
all other allocations provided in this Article 6 have been tentatively made as
if this Section 6.3.B(iv) were not in the Agreement. It is intended that this
Section 6.3.B(iv) qualify and be construed as a "qualified income offset,"
within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | _Gross Income Allocation_. If any Holder has a deficit
Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal Year that is in excess of the sum of
(1) the amount (if any) that such Holder is obligated to restore to
the Company upon complete liquidation of such Holders Membership Interest
(including the Holders interest in outstanding Company Preferred Units and
other Membership Units), and (2) the amount that such Holder is deemed to be
obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Holder shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such excess to
eliminate such deficit as quickly as possible; _provided_ that an allocation
pursuant to this Section 6.3.B(v) shall be made if and only to the extent that
such Holder would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after
all other allocations provided in this Article 6 have been tentatively made as
if this Section 6.3.B(v) and Section 6.3.B(iv) hereof were not in the
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



49 that any allocation of Net Loss would cause or increase an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit as to any Holder, such allocation of Net Loss shall be
reallocated (x) first, among the other Holders of Membership Common Units in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, and (y) thereafter,
among the Holders of other Membership Units, as determined by the Managing
Member, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.3.B(vi). 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | _Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent that an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Code
Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such gain or loss
shall be specially allocated to the Holders of Membership Common Units in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests in the event that
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Holder(s) to
whom such distribution was made in the event that Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies (or otherwise as described in Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4)). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (viii) | _Curative Allocations_. The allocations set forth in
Sections 6.3.B(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) hereof (the "
_Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain regulatory
requirements, including the requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)
and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1 hereof,
the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other
items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Holders of Membership
Common Units so that, to the extent possible without violating the
requirements giving rise to the Regulatory Allocations, the net amount of
such allocations of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Holder
of a Membership Common Unit shall be equal to the net amount that would have
been allocated to each such Holder if the Regulatory Allocations had not
occurred. 
---|---|--- 

C. _Special Allocations Upon Liquidation_. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Article 6 to the contrary, if the Company disposes of all or
substantially all of its assets in a transaction that will lead to a
liquidation of the Company pursuant to Article 13 hereof, then any Net Income
or Net Loss realized in connection with such transaction and thereafter (and,
if necessary, constituent items of income, gain, loss and deduction) shall be
specially allocated for such Fiscal Year (and to the extent permitted by Code
Section 761(c), for the immediately preceding Fiscal Year) among the Holders
as required so as to cause liquidating distributions pursuant to Section
13.2.A(2) hereof to be made in the same amounts and proportions as would have
resulted had such distributions instead been made pursuant to Article 5
hereof.

 



50 D. _Allocation of Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of determining a
Holders proportional share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the
Company within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), each Holders
respective interest in Company profits shall be equal to such Holders
Percentage Interest with respect to Membership Common Units.

E. _Special Allocations Regarding LTIP Units_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 6.2 above, any Liquidating Gains remaining after the allocation of
any such Liquidating Gains to Holders of Company Preferred Units and Company
Equivalent Units pursuant to Section 6.2.A(i) shall first be allocated to the
LTIP Unitholders until the Economic Capital Account Balances of such Holders,
to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, are equal to (i)
the Membership Common Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii) the number of
their LTIP Units (the " _Target Balance_ ") and thereafter shall be allocated
in accordance with Section 6.2.A(ii); _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless
otherwise specified by the Managing Member in the grant of specific LTIP
Units, no such Liquidating Gains will be allocated with respect to any
particular LTIP Unit unless and to the extent that such Liquidating Gains,
when aggregated with other Liquidating Gains realized since the issuance of
such LTIP Unit, exceed Liquidating Losses realized since the issuance of such
LTIP Unit. Liquidating Gains that cannot be allocated to LTIP Unitholders by
reason of the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
allocated to the holders of Membership Common Units. Liquidating Gains
otherwise allocable to the LTIP Unitholders pursuant to the second preceding
sentence shall be allocated (i) on a "first-in, first-out" basis with respect
to LTIP Units issued on different dates and (ii) on an equal basis with
respect to LTIP Units issued on the same date (i.e., Liquidating Gains shall
be allocated first to the LTIP Units that were issued on the earliest date,
and then with respect to such LTIP Units, equally among such LTIP Units). For
this purpose, "Liquidating Gains" means net capital gains realized in
connection with the actual or hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, including net capital gain realized in connection
with an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of Company assets under Code
Section 704(b). "Liquidating Losses" means any net capital loss realized in
connection with any such event. The " _Economic Capital Account Balances_ " of
the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account balances to the
extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, plus the amount of their
allocable share of any Member Minimum Gain or Company Minimum Gain
attributable to such LTIP Units. Similarly, the " _Membership Common
Unit Economic Balance_ " shall mean (i) the Capital Account balance of the
Managing Member, plus the amount of the Managing Members share of any Member
Minimum Gain or Company Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent
attributable to the Managing Members ownership of Membership Common Units
and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations
through the date on which any allocation is made under this Section 6.3.E
(including any expenses of the Company reimbursed to the Managing Member
pursuant to Section 7.4.B), divided by (ii) the number of the Managing
Members Membership Common Units. The parties agree that the intent of this
Section 6.3.E is to make the Capital Account balance associated with each
LTIP Unit to be economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance
associated with the Managing Members Membership Common Units (on a per-
Membership Common Unit/LTIP Unit basis). The Managing Member shall be
permitted to interpret this Section 6.3.E or to amend this Agreement to the
extent necessary and consistent with this intention.

 



51 Section 6.4 _Tax Allocations_.

 

A. _In General_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, for income
tax purposes under the Code and the Regulations, each Company item of income,
gain, loss and deduction (collectively, "Tax Items") shall be allocated among
the Holders in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain,
loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof.

B. _Section 704(c) Allocations_. Notwithstanding Section 6.4.A hereof, Tax
Items with respect to Property that is contributed to the Company with a
Gross Asset Value that varies from its basis in the hands of the contributing
Member immediately preceding the date of contribution shall be allocated among
the Holders for income tax purposes pursuant to Regulations promulgated under
Code Section 704(c) so as to take into account such variation. The Company
shall account for such variation under any method approved under Code Section
704(c) and the applicable Regulations as chosen by the Managing Member;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to the assets contributed to the
Company by RED REIT in connection with the RED REIT Contribution pursuant to
the Combination Agreement, the Company shall use the "traditional method"
(without any curative allocations) provided for in the applicable Regulations
under Code Section 704(c). If the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is
adjusted pursuant to subsection (b) of the definition of "Gross Asset Value,"
subsequent allocations of Tax Items with respect to such asset shall take
account of the variation, if any, between the adjusted basis of such asset and
its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the
applicable Regulations and using the method chosen by the Managing Member.

ARTICLE 7

 

MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS OF BUSINESS

agreement, certificate, consent, instrument, notice, power of attorney, waiver
or other writing or document in the name and on behalf of the Company and to
otherwise exercise any power of the Managing Member under this Agreement and
the Act without any further act, approval or vote of the Members or any other
Persons and, in the absence of any specific action on the part of the
Managing Member to the contrary, the taking of any action or the execution of
any such document or writing by a manager, member, director or officer of the
Managing Member, in the name and on behalf of the Managing Member, in its
capacity as the managing member of the Company, shall conclusively evidence
(1) the approval thereof by the Managing Member, in its capacity as the
managing member of the Company, (2) the Managing Members determination
that such action, document or writing is necessary or desirable to conduct
the business and affairs of the Company, exercise the powers of the Company
under the Act and this Agreement or effectuate the purposes of the Company, or
any other determination by the Managing Member required by this Agreement in
connection with the taking of such action or execution of such document or
writing, and (3) the authority of such manager, member, director or officer
with respect thereto.

 

C. The determination as to any of the following matters, made by or at the
direction of the Managing Member consistent with the Act and this Agreement,
shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding upon the Company and every
Member: the amount of assets at any time available for distribution or the
redemption of Membership Common Units or Company Preferred Units; the amount
and timing of any distribution; any determination to redeem Tendered Units;
the amount, purpose, time of creation, increase or decrease, alteration or
cancellation of any reserves or charges and the propriety thereof (whether or
not any obligation or liability for which such reserves or charges shall have
been created shall have been paid or discharged); the fair value, or any sale,
bid or asked price to be applied in determining the fair value, of any asset
owned or held by the Company; any matter relating to the acquisition, holding
and disposition of any assets by the Company; or any other matter relating to
the business and affairs of the Company or required or permitted by applicable
law, this Agreement or otherwise to be determined by the Managing Member.

D. At all times from and after the date hereof, the Managing Member may cause
the Company to establish and maintain working capital and other reserves in
such amounts as the Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion,
deems appropriate and reasonable from time to time.

 

E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Act, any
action of the Managing Member on behalf of the Company or any decision of the
Managing Member to refrain from acting on behalf of the Company, undertaken in
the belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in order (i)
to protect the ability of CLNS Credit to continue to qualify as a REIT, (ii)
for CLNS Credit otherwise to satisfy the REIT Requirements,

 



53  (iii) for CLNS Credit to avoid incurring any taxes under Code Section 857 or
Code Section 4981, (iv) to protect the ability of the Company to be treated as
a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, or (v)
for any wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit to continue to qualify as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) or
disregarded entity (determined for federal income tax purposes) thereof, is
expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the
Members.

 

F. The Managing Member may, pursuant the Management Agreement or otherwise,
delegate any or all of its powers, rights and obligations hereunder, and may
appoint, employ, contract or otherwise deal with any Person, including
Affiliates of the Managing Member, for the transaction of the business of the
Company, which Person may, under supervision of the Managing Member, perform
any acts or services for the Company as the Managing Member may approve.

Section 7.2 _Certificate of Formation_. To the extent that such action is
determined by the Managing Member to be reasonable and necessary or
appropriate, the Managing Member shall file amendments to and restatements of
the Certificate and do all the things to maintain the Company as a limited
liability company (or a company in which the members have limited liability)
under the laws of the State of Delaware and each other state, the District of
Columbia or any other jurisdiction, in which the Company may elect to do
business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 8.5.A hereof, the
Managing Member shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or
mail a copy of the Certificate or any amendment thereto to any Member. The
Managing Member shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such
other certificates or documents as may be reasonable and necessary or
appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a
limited liability company (or a company in which the members have limited
liability to the extent provided by applicable law) in the State of Delaware
and any other state, or the District of Columbia or other jurisdiction, in
which the Company may elect to do business or own property.

 

Section 7.3 _Restrictions on the Managing Member s Authority_.

 

A. The Managing Member may not take any action in contravention of this
Agreement, including, without limitation:

     | (11) | to reflect any other modification to this Agreement that is
reasonably necessary for the business or operations of the Company or CLNS
Credit and that does not violate Section 7.3.D. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Company will provide notice to the Members when any action taken under
this Section 7.3.C is taken.

 

D. Notwithstanding Sections 7.3.B, 7.3.C and Article 14 hereof, this Agreement
shall not be amended, and no action may be taken by the Managing Member
(including by way of merger, consolidation or any similar transaction),
without the consent of each Member, if any, adversely affected thereby, if
such amendment or action would (i) convert a Non-Managing Member into a
managing member of the Company (except as a result of the Non-Managing Member
becoming a Managing Member pursuant to Section 12.1 or 13.1.A of this
Agreement), (ii) modify the limited liability of a Member, (iii) adversely
alter the rights of any Member to receive the distributions to which such
Member is entitled pursuant to Article 5 or Section 13.2.A(4) hereof, or
alter the allocations specified in Article 6 hereof (except, in any case, as
permitted pursuant to Sections 4.2, 5.5 and 7.3.C hereof), (iv) alter or
modify in a manner that adversely affects any Member the Redemption rights,
Cash Amount or REIT Shares Amount as set forth in Section 15.1 hereof, or
amend or modify any related definitions (except for amendments to this
Agreement or other actions that provide rights consistent with Section
11.7.C), or (v) amend this Section 7.3.D; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
consent of any individual Member adversely affected shall not be required for
any amendment or action described in this Section 7.3.D(iii) or (iv)
that affects all Members holding the same class or series of Membership Units
on a uniform or pro rata basis, if approved by a Majority in Interest of the
Members of such class or series. Further, no amendment may alter the
restrictions on the Managing Members authority set forth elsewhere in this
Section 7.3 without the consent specified therein. Any such amendment or
action consented to by any Member shall be effective as to that Member,
notwithstanding the absence of such consent by any other Member.

Section 7.4 _Reimbursement of the Managing Member and CLNS Credit_.

 

A. The Managing Member shall not be compensated for its services as managing
member of the Company except as provided in this Agreement (including the
provisions of Articles 5 and 6 hereof regarding distributions, payments and
allocations to which it may be entitled in its capacity as Managing Member).

 

B. Subject to Section 7.4.C and Section 15.11, the Company shall be liable
for, and shall advance to or reimburse the Managing Member and CLNS Credit,
as applicable, on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the Managing Member
may determine, for all sums required or expended in connection with the
Companys business, including (i) expenses relating to the ownership
of interests in and management and operation of, or for the benefit of, the
Company, (ii) compensation of directors, officers, employees and agents,
including payments

 



57  under future compensation plans of CLNS Credit, the Managing Member, the
Company, the Manager or a Subsidiary of CLNS Credit, the Managing Member, or
the Company that may provide for stock units, or phantom stock, pursuant to
which directors, officers, employees and agents of CLNS Credit, the Managing
Member, the Company, or any such Subsidiary will receive payments based upon
dividends on or the value of REIT Shares, (iii) director fees and expenses,
(iv) all costs and expenses of CLNS Credit being a public company, including
costs of filings with the SEC, reports and other distributions to its
stockholders, and (v) all amounts necessary for the timely payment of
all interest, principal and other payment obligations pursuant to any notes
and long-term debt payable or owed by CLNS Credit; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the amount of any reimbursement shall be reduced by any interest earned
by the Managing Member or CLNS Credit with respect to bank accounts or other
instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the Company as permitted
pursuant to Section 7.5. Such reimbursements shall be in addition to any
reimbursement of the Managing Member and CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 7.7
hereof.

C. To the extent practicable, Company expenses shall be billed directly to
and paid by the Company. If and to the extent any reimbursements to the
Managing Member pursuant to this Section 7.4 constitute gross income to the
Managing Member (as opposed to the repayment of advances made on behalf of
the Company), such amounts shall (unless otherwise required by the Code and
the Regulations) constitute guaranteed payments within the meaning of Section
707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith by the Company and
all Members, and shall not be treated as distributions for purposes of
computing the Members Capital Accounts.

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities of the Managing Member_. The Managing Member,
for so long as it is the Managing Member of the Company, shall not directly or
indirectly enter into or conduct any business, other than in connection with,
(a) the ownership, acquisition and disposition of Membership Interests, (b)
the management of the business of the Company, (c) its operation as a
reporting company with a class (or classes) of securities registered under the
Exchange Act, (d) its operations as a REIT, (e) the offering, sale,
syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities
or other interests, (f) financing or refinancing of any type related to the
Company or its assets or activities, (g) the holding, operation, acquisition
or disposition of Excluded Properties in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement with respect thereto and (h) such activities as are incidental
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Managing Member may from time to
time hold or acquire assets in its own name or otherwise other than through
the Company so long as the Managing Member takes commercially reasonable
measures to insure that the economic benefits and burdens of such Property
are otherwise vested in the Company, through assignment, mortgage loan or
otherwise or, if it is not commercially reasonable to vest such economic
interests in the Company, the Members shall negotiate in good faith to amend
this Agreement, including the definition of "Adjustment Factor," to reflect
such activities and the direct ownership of assets by the Managing Member, as
applicable. The Managing Member and all "qualified REIT subsidiaries" (within
the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) and disregarded entities (determined
for federal income tax purposes) thereof, taken as a group, shall not own any
assets or take title to assets (other than temporarily in connection with an
acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the Company) other than (i)
Excluded Properties, (ii) interests in "qualified REIT subsidiaries" (within
the meaning of

 



58  Code Section 856(i)(2)) or disregarded entities (determined for federal
income tax purposes), (iii) Membership Interests as the Managing Member or
CLNS Credit and (iv) such cash and cash equivalents, bank accounts or similar
instruments or accounts as such group deems reasonably necessary, taking into
account Section 7.1.D hereof and the requirements necessary for CLNS Credit to
qualify as a REIT and for the Managing Member and CLNS Credit to carry out
their respective responsibilities contemplated under this Agreement and the
Charter. The Managing Member and any Affiliates of the Managing Member may
acquire Membership Interests and shall be entitled to exercise all rights of
a Member relating to such Membership Interests.

Section 7.6 _Transactions with Affiliates_.

 

A. The Company may lend or contribute funds or other assets to CLNS Credit and
its Subsidiaries or other Persons in which CLNS Credit has an equity
investment, and such Persons may borrow funds from the Company, on terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than would be
available from unaffiliated third parties, as determined by the Managing
Member. The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in
favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person. It is expressly acknowledged and
agreed by each Member that CLNS Credit may (i) borrow funds from the Company
in order to redeem, at any time or from time to time, options or warrants
previously or hereafter issued by CLNS Credit, (ii) put to the Company, for
cash, any rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities
that CLNS Credit may desire or be required to purchase or redeem, or (iii)
borrow funds from the Company to acquire assets that become Excluded
Properties or will be contributed to the Company for Membership Units.

 

B. Except as provided in Section 7.5 hereof and subject to Section 3.1 hereof,
the Company may transfer assets to joint ventures, limited liability
companies, partnerships, corporations, business trusts or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions consistent with this Agreement and applicable
law. 

C. The Managing Member, CLNS Credit, CLNS and their respective Affiliates may
sell, transfer or convey any property to the Company, directly or indirectly,
on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate,
than would be available from unaffiliated third parties, as determined by the
Managing Member.

 

D. The Managing Member or CLNS Credit, without the approval of the other
Members or any of them or any other Persons, may propose and adopt, on behalf
of the Company, employee benefit plans funded by the Company for the benefit
of employees of the Managing Member, the Company, the Manager, CLNS Credit,
Subsidiaries of the Company or any Affiliate of any of them in respect of
services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Managing
Member, CLNS Credit, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries. As used
in this section 7.7.D, references to a "third party" shall not include any
Person entitled to be indemnified by the Company with respect to the
applicable losses or other amounts.

 



59 E. Any Affiliate of the Managing Member may be employed or retained by the
Company and may otherwise deal with the Company (whether as a buyer, lessor,
lessee, manager, furnisher of goods or services, broker, agent, lender or
otherwise) and may receive from the Company any compensation, price, or other
payment therefor which the Managing Member determines to be fair and
reasonable, in its sole discretion.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_.

 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall
indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including
attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, that relate to the operations of the Company (" _Actions_ "),
as set forth in this Agreement, in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or
is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not indemnify an Indemnitee (i) for any
Action if it is established by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that the actions or omissions of the Indemnitee were material to
the matter giving rise to the Action and were committed in bad faith,
constituted fraud or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty on
the part of the Indemnitee, (ii) for an Action initiated by the Indemnitee
(other than an Action to enforce such Indemnitees rights to indemnification
or advance of expenses under this Section 7.7), (iii) if the Indemnitee
actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services,
or (iv) for a criminal proceeding if the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to
believe that the Indemnitees act or omission was unlawful. Without
limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any
Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (including any indebtedness which
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has assumed or taken subject to),
and the Managing Member is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the
Company, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent with the
provisions of this Section 7.7 in favor of any Indemnitee having or
potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. It is the intention
of this Section 7.7.A that the Company indemnify each Indemnitee to the
fullest extent permitted by law. The termination of any proceeding by
judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the
Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this
Section 7.7.A. The termination of any proceeding by conviction of an
Indemnitee or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent by an
Indemnitee, or an entry of an order of probation against an Indemnitee prior
to judgment, does not create a presumption that such Indemnitee acted in a
manner contrary to that specified in this Section 7.7.A with respect to the
subject matter of such proceeding. Any indemnity provided pursuant to this
Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Company, and neither
the Managing Member nor any other Holder shall have any obligation to
contribute to the capital of the Company or otherwise provide funds to
enable the Company to fund its obligations under this Section 7.7.

B. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses incurred by an Indemnitee
who is a party to a proceeding or otherwise subject to or the focus of or is
involved in any Action shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company as incurred
by the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of the Action upon
receipt by the Company of (i) a written affirmation by the

 



60  Indemnitee of the Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company, as authorized in Section
7.7.A, has been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the
standard of conduct has not been met; _provided_ that such undertaking need
not be secured and shall be without reference to the financial ability for
repayment.

C. The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Members, as a matter of law
or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve
in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors,
assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee unless otherwise provided in a
written agreement with such Indemnitee or in the writing pursuant to which
such Indemnitee is indemnified.

 

D. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 7.7 to the contrary, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, (i) each Indemnitee must use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue all other sources of indemnification,
advancement, insurance, and contribution it has against third parties, with
respect to the amounts to which it is entitled under this Section 7.7, (ii)
any such third party shall be the indemnitor of first resort and any
obligation of the Company to provide payments under this Section 7.7 for
amounts to which an Indemnitee is entitled are secondary, (iii) if the Company
pays or causes to be paid any amounts under this Section 7.7 that should have
been paid by a third party, then (x) the Company shall be fully subrogated to
the rights of such Indemnitee with respect to such payment, (y) such
Indemnitee shall assign to the Company all of such Indemnitees rights to
advancement, indemnification and contribution from or with respect to such
third party, and (z) such Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Company (at the
expense of the Company) in its efforts to recover such payments through
indemnification or otherwise, including filing a claim against such third
party in the name of the Indemnitee, (iv) the Indemnitee will not agree to
subordinate or otherwise compromise or release indemnity from a third party,
without the consent of the Managing Member (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (v) in the event the Company has previously provided separate
indemnification or advancement in connection therewith, the Indemnitee
shall reimburse the Company with any subsequent proceeds it receives from
such third parties. The intent of this Section 7.7.D is to set forth the
relative responsibilities of the Company and third parties who have
overlapping indemnity, advancement or contribution obligations to an
Indemnitee. Nothing in this Section 7.7.D is intended to diminish the
indemnification and advancement rights given by the Company to an Indemnitee,
including the right to receive prompt payment of valid indemnification and
advancement claims if any third party is unwilling or unable to do so
promptly.

E. The Company and/or the Managing Member may, but shall not be obligated to,
purchase and maintain, at the Companys expense, insurance on behalf of any of
the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the Managing Member shall determine,
against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be
incurred by such Person in connection with the Companys activities,
regardless of whether the Company would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 

 



61 F. Any liabilities that an Indemnitee incurs as a result of acting on behalf
of the Company, or the Managing Member or CLNS Credit (whether as a fiduciary
or otherwise) in connection with the operation, administration or maintenance
of an employee benefit plan or any related trust or funding mechanism (whether
such liabilities are in the form of excise taxes assessed by the IRS,
penalties assessed by the Department of Labor, restitutions to such a plan or
trust or other funding mechanism or to a participant or beneficiary of such
plan, trust or other funding mechanism, or otherwise) shall be treated as
liabilities or judgments or fines under this Section 7.7, unless such
liabilities arise as a result of the matters described in the proviso of the
first sentence of Section 7.7.A.

 

G. In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Holders to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Agreement.

H. An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

I. The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed
to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any amendment,
modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the Companys liability to
any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or
relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise
or be asserted.

J. If and to the extent any payments to the Managing Member pursuant to this
Section 7.7 constitute gross income to the Managing Member (as opposed to the
repayment of advances made on behalf of the Company), such amounts shall
(unless otherwise required by the Code and the Regulations) constitute
guaranteed payments within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be
treated consistently therewith by the Company and all Members, and shall not
be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Members Capital
Accounts.

Section 7.8 _Liability of the Managing Member_.

 

A. To the maximum extent permitted under the Act, the only duties that the
Managing Member owes to the Company, any Member or any other
Person (including any creditor of any Member or Assignee of any Membership
Interest), fiduciary or otherwise, are to perform its contractual obligations
as expressly set forth in this Agreement consistently with the implied
contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Managing Member, in
its capacity as such, shall have no other duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to the
Company, any Member or any other Person (including any creditor of any Member
or any Assignee of Membership Interest). The provisions of this Agreement
shall create contractual obligations of the Managing Member only, and no such
provisions shall be interpreted to create, expand or modify any fiduciary
duties of the Managing Member.

 



62 B. The Non-Managing Members agree that: (i) the Managing Member is acting for
the benefit of the Company, the Non-Managing Members and CLNS Credits
stockholders, collectively; and (ii) in the event of a conflict between the
interests of the Company or any Member, on the one hand, and the separate
interests of CLNS Credit or its stockholders, on the other hand, the Managing
Member may give priority to the separate interests of CLNS Credit and its
stockholders (including with respect to the tax consequences to Non-Managing
Members, Assignees or CLNS Credits stockholders) and, in the event of such a
conflict, any action or failure to act on the part of CLNS Credit that gives
priority to the separate interests of CLNS Credit or its stockholders that
does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the Non-Managing
Members under this Agreement and does not violate any duty owed by
the Managing Member to the Company or the Members.

C. In exercising its authority under this Agreement, the Managing Member may,
but shall be under no obligation to, take into account the tax consequences
to any Member of any action taken (or not taken) by it. Except as otherwise
agreed by the Company, the Managing Member and the Company shall not have
liability to a Non-Managing Member under any circumstances as a result of any
income tax liability incurred by such Non-Managing Member as a result of an
action (or inaction) by the Managing Member or the Company pursuant to the
Managing Members authority under this Agreement.

D. Subject to its obligations and duties as managing member of the Company
set forth in this Agreement and applicable law, the Managing Member may
exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of
the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its
employees or agents, including the Manager. The Managing Member shall not be
responsible to the Company or any Member for any misconduct or negligence on
the part of any such employee or agent appointed by it in good faith.

 

E. In performing its duties under this Agreement and the Act, the Managing
Member shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement and on
any information, opinion, report or statement, including any financial
statement or other financial data or the records or books of account of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, prepared or presented by an officer,
employee or agent of the Managing Member or the Manager or any agent of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, or by a lawyer, certified public accountant,
appraiser or other person engaged by the Company as to any matter within such
persons professional or expert competence, and any act taken or omitted to
be taken in reliance upon any such information, opinion, report or statement
as to matters that the Managing Member reasonably believes to be within such
Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to
have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
The Managing Member may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or
document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.

 



63 F. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Act, any
action of the Managing Member on behalf of the Company or any decision of the
Managing Member to refrain from acting on behalf of the Company, undertaken in
the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable
in order (i) to protect the ability of CLNS Credit to continue to qualify as
a REIT, (ii) for CLNS Credit otherwise to satisfy the REIT Requirements, (iii)
to avoid CLNS Credit incurring any taxes under Code Section 857 or Code
Section 4981, (iv) to protect the ability of the Company to be treated as a
partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, or (v) for
any wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit to continue to qualify as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) or
disregarded entity (determined for federal income tax purposes) thereof, is
expressly authorized under this Agreement, is deemed approved by all of
the Non-Managing Members and does not violate any duty of the Managing Member
to the Company or any other Member.

 

G. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except for the matters
described in the proviso of the first sentence of Section 7.7.A, or pursuant
to any express indemnities given to the Company by the Managing Member
pursuant to any other written instrument, the Managing Member shall not have
any personal liability whatsoever, to the Company or to the other Members,
for any action or omission taken in its capacity as the Managing Member or for
the debts or liabilities of the Company or the Companys obligations hereunder
except pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof. Without limitation of the foregoing,
and except for the matters described in the proviso of the first sentence of
Section 7.7.A, or pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof or any such express
indemnity, no property or assets of the Managing Member, other than its
interest in the Company, shall be subject to levy, execution or other
enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of any judgment (or other judicial
process) in favor of any other Member(s) and arising out of, or in connection
with, this Agreement.

 

H. No manager, member, officer or agent of the Managing Member, and no
director, officer, employee or agent of CLNS Credit shall have any duties
directly to the Company or any Member. No manager, member, officer or agent of
the Managing Member or any director, officer or agent of CLNS Credit shall be
directly liable to the Company or any Member for money damages by reason of
their service as such.

I. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Managing Member, or its managers, members,
directors, officers or agents, to the Company and the Members under this
Section 7.8, as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal, with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

 

Section 7.9 _Title to Company Assets_. Title to Company assets, whether real,
personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be
owned by the Company as an entity, and no Member, individually or collectively
with other Members or Persons, shall have any ownership interest in such
Company assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the
Company assets may be held in the name of the Company, the Managing Member or
one or

 



64  more nominees, as the Managing Member may determine, including Affiliates of
the Managing Member. The Managing Member hereby declares and warrants that any
Company assets for which legal title is held in the name of the Managing
Member or any nominee or Affiliate of the Managing Member shall be held by the
Managing Member for the use and benefit of the Company in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. All Company assets shall be recorded as the
property of the Company in its books and records, irrespective of the name in
which legal title to such Company assets is held.

 

Section 7.10 _Reliance by Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Company shall be
entitled to assume that the Managing Member has full power and authority,
without the consent or approval of any other Member, or Person, to encumber,
sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the Company and
to enter into any contracts on behalf of the Company, and take any and all
actions on behalf of the Company, and such Person shall be entitled to deal
with the Managing Member as if it were the Companys sole party in interest,
both legally and beneficially. Each Member hereby waives any and all defenses
or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate
or disaffirm any action of the Managing Member in connection with any such
dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the Managing Member or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement
have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expediency of any
act or action of the Managing Member or its representatives. Each and every
certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Company by
the Managing Member or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in
favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i)
at the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or
instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person
executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly
authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Company, and (iii)
such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon
the Company.

ARTICLE 8

 

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

 

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Liability_. No Non-Managing Member, in its capacity
as such, shall have any duties or liability under this Agreement except as
expressly provided in this Agreement (including Sections 10.3.C and 10.4
hereof) or under the Act. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Member,
including CLNS Credit, shall have any personal liability whatsoever, to the
Company or to the other Members, for any action or omission taken in its
capacity as a member or for the debts or liabilities of the Company or the
Companys obligations hereunder, except pursuant to any express indemnities
given to the Company by such Member pursuant to any other written instrument
and except for liabilities of the Managing Member pursuant to Section 7.8
hereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, and except pursuant to any such
express indemnity (and, in the case of the Managing Member, pursuant to
Section 7.8 hereof), no property or assets of a Member, other than its
interest in the Company, shall be subject to levy, execution or other
enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of any judgment (or other
judicial process) in favor of any other Member(s) and arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement.

 



65 Section 8.2 _Management of Business_. No Member or Assignee (other than in its
separate capacity as the Managing Member, the Manager, any of their
Affiliates or any officer, director, manager, member, employee, partner,
agent, representative or trustee of the Managing Member, the Company, the
Manager or any of their Affiliates, in their capacity as such) shall take
part in the operations, management or control (within the meaning of the Act)
of the Companys business, transact any business in the Companys name or have
the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the Company. The
transaction of any such business by the Managing Member, any of its Affiliates
or any officer, director, manager, member, employee, partner, agent,
representative or trustee of the Managing Member, the Company or any of
their Affiliates, in their capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or
eliminate the limitations on the liability of the Members or Assignees under
this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 _Outside Activities of Non-Managing Members_. Subject to any
agreements entered into pursuant to Section 7.6 hereof and any other
agreements entered into by a Non-Managing Member or any of its Affiliates with
the Managing Member, the Company or a Subsidiary (including any
employment agreement), any Non-Managing Member and any Assignee, officer,
director, employee, agent, representative, trustee, Affiliate, manager, member
or stockholder of any Non-Managing Member shall be entitled to and may have
business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those
relating to the Company, including business interests and activities that are
in direct or indirect competition with the Company or that are enhanced by
the activities of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Member shall have
any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any Non-
Managing Member or Assignee. Subject to such agreements, none of the Non-
Managing Members nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement or the company relationship established hereby in any business
ventures of any other Person (other than CLNS Credit, to the extent expressly
provided herein), and such Person shall have no obligation pursuant to this
Agreement, subject to Section 7.6 hereof and any other agreements entered
into by a Non-Managing Member or its Affiliates with the Managing Member, the
Company or a Subsidiary, to offer any interest in any such business ventures
to the Company, any Non-Managing Member, or any such other Person, even if
such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Company, any Non-
Managing Member or such other Person, could be taken by such Person.

Section 8.4 _Return of Capital_. Except pursuant to Section 15.1 or
any Membership Unit Designation, no Member shall be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent of

income, gains, deductions, losses and other items required of the Company for
federal and state income tax purposes and shall use all reasonable effort to

Combination Agreement.

 

Section 10.2 _Tax Elections_.

 

A. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Managing Member shall determine
whether to make any available election pursuant to the Code, including any
election under the New Partnership Audit Procedures, the election under Code
Section 754 and the election to use the "recurring item" method of accounting
provided under Code Section 461(h) with respect to property taxes imposed on

B. Without limiting the foregoing, the Members, intending to be legally bound,
hereby authorize the Managing Member, on behalf of the Company, to make an
election (the " _LV Safe Harbor Election_ ") to have the "liquidation value"
safe harbor provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.83-3(1) and the
Proposed Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when such proposed guidance is
issued in final form or as amended by subsequently issued guidance (the " _LV
Safe Harbor_ "), apply to LTIP Units and any interest in the Company
transferred to, or for the benefit of, a service provider while the LV Safe
Harbor Election remains effective, to the extent such interest meets the LV
Safe Harbor requirements (collectively, such interests are referred to as "
_LV Safe Harbor Interests_ "). The Tax Matters Member or Managing Member, as
applicable, is authorized and directed to execute and file the LV Safe Harbor
Election on behalf of the Company and the Members. The Company and the
Members (including any person to whom an LTIP Unit or other interest in the
Company is transferred in connection with the performance of services) hereby
agree to comply with all requirements of the LV Safe Harbor (including
forfeiture allocations) with respect to all LV Safe Harbor Interests and to
prepare and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting the tax
consequences of the issuance and vesting of LV Safe Harbor Interests

Harbor, the effect that the election and compliance with all requirements of
the LV Safe Harbor referred to above would be intended to achieve under
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-3, including amending this
Agreement.

 



69 Section 10.3 _Tax Matters Member and Partnership Representative_.

 

A. With respect to periods not governed by changes to the Code enacted by the

the tax matters partner within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code
prior to amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (" _Tax Matters
Member_ "). With respect to periods governed by the New Partnership Audit
Procedures, to the extent permissible under the New Partnership Audit
Procedures, the Managing Member, or such person designated by the Managing
Member, shall be designated as the "partnership representative" (within the
meaning of Section 6223 of the New Partnership Audit Procedures (the "
_Partnership Representative_ "). Neither the Tax Matters Member nor the
Partnership Representative shall receive compensation for its services. All
third-party costs and expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Member or
Partnership Representative in performing its duties as such (including legal
and accounting fees and expenses) shall be borne by the Company in addition to
any reimbursement pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof. Nothing herein shall be
construed to restrict the Company from engaging a law, advisory, or accounting
firm to assist the Tax Matters Member or Partnership Representative in
discharging its duties hereunder. At the request of any Member, the Managing
Member agrees to inform such Member regarding the preparation and filing of
any returns and with respect to any subsequent audit or litigation relating to
such returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Managing Member shall
have the exclusive power to determine whether to file, and the content of,
such returns.

B. The Tax Matters Member is authorized, but not required:



     | (1) | to enter into any settlement with the IRS with respect to
any administrative or judicial proceedings for the adjustment of Company items
required to be taken into account by a Member for income tax purposes
(such administrative proceedings being referred to as a " _tax audit_ " and
such judicial proceedings being referred to as " _judicial review_ "), and in
the settlement agreement the Tax Matters Member may expressly state that such
agreement shall bind all Members, except that such settlement agreement shall
not bind any Member (i) who (within the time prescribed pursuant to the Code
and Regulations) files a statement with the IRS providing that the Tax
Matters Member shall not have the authority to enter into a settlement
agreement on behalf of such Member (as the case may be) or (ii) who is a
"notice partner" (as defined in Code Section 6231) or a member of a "notice
group" (as defined in Code Section 6223(b)(2)); 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | in the event that a notice of a final administrative
adjustment at the Company level of any item required to be taken into account
by a Member for tax purposes (a " _final adjustment_ ") is mailed to the Tax
Matters Member, to seek judicial review of such final adjustment, including
the filing of a petition for readjustment with the United States Tax Court or
the United States Claims Court, or the filing of a complaint for refund with
the District Court of the United States for the district in which the
Companys principal place of business is located; 
---|---|--- 
 



70 for judicial review of a final adjustment; 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | to file a request for an administrative adjustment with the
IRS at any time and, if any part of such request is not allowed by the IRS, to
file an appropriate pleading (petition or complaint) for judicial review
with respect to such request; 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | to enter into an agreement with the IRS to extend the period
for assessing any tax that is attributable to any item required to be taken
into account by a Member for tax purposes, or an item affected by such item;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (6) | to take any other action on behalf of the Members or any of
them in connection with any tax audit or judicial review proceeding to the
extent permitted by applicable law or regulations. 
---|---|--- 
 

The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the Tax Matters
Member in connection with any such proceeding, except to the extent required
by law, is a matter in the sole and absolute discretion of the Tax Matters
Member and the provisions relating to indemnification of the Managing Member
set forth in Section 7.7 hereof shall be fully applicable to the Tax Matters
Member in its capacity as such.

C. The Partnership Representative is authorized and required to represent the
Company in connection with all examinations of the Companys affairs by tax
authorities, including any resulting administrative and judicial proceedings.
Under Section 6225 of the New Partnership Audit Procedures, in the case of any
adjustment by the IRS in the amount of any item of income, gain, loss,
deduction, or credit of the Companys or any Members distributive share
thereof (" _IRS Adjustment_ "), the Company may pay an imputed underpayment as
calculated under Section 6225(b) of the New Partnership Audit Procedures with
respect to the IRS Adjustment, including interest and penalties (" _Imputed
Tax Underpayment_ ") in the Adjustment Year or otherwise take the IRS
Adjustment into account in the Adjustment Year. Each Member does hereby agree
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Managing Member and the
Partnership Representative from and against any liability with respect to the
Members proportionate share of any Imputed Tax Underpayment or other IRS
Adjustment resulting in liability of the Company, regardless of whether such
Member is a partner in the Partnership in an Adjustment Year, with such
proportionate share as reasonably determined by the Managing
Member, including the Managing Members reasonable discretion to consider (i)
each Members interest in the Company in the Reviewed Year, (ii) each Members
status under Section 6225(c) and (iii) a Members timely provision of
information necessary to reduce the amount of Imputed Tax Underpayment set
forth in Section 6225(c) of the New Partnership Audit Procedures. This
obligation shall survive a Members ceasing to be a member of the Company
and/or the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the
Company. The Managing Member

 



71  may in its sole discretion elect under Section 6226 of the New Partnership
Audit Procedures to cause the Company to issue adjusted Internal Revenue
Service Schedules K-1 (or such other form as applicable) reflecting a Members
shares of any IRS Adjustment for the Adjustment Year as an alternative to the
Companys payment of an Imputed Tax Underpayment for any tax year. 

Section 10.4 _Withholding_. Each Member hereby authorizes the Company to
withhold from or pay on behalf of or with respect to such Member any amount
of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that the Managing Member determines
that the Company is required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount
distributable or allocable to such Member pursuant to this
Agreement, including any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the Company
pursuant to Code Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 or 1472. Any amount
paid on behalf of or with respect to a Member, including any Imputed Tax
Underpayment, shall constitute an advance by the Company to such Member,
which advance shall be repaid by such Member within fifteen (15) days after
notice from the Managing Member that such payment must be made except to the
extent that (i) the Company withholds such payment from a distribution that
would otherwise be made to the Member or (ii) the Managing Member determines
that such payment may be satisfied out of the Available Cash of the Company
that would, but for such payment, be distributed to the Member, and such
amount actually is satisfied out of such cash. Each Member hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company a security interest in
such Members Membership Interest to secure such Members obligation to pay
to the Company any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 10.3.C and
this Section 10.4 and subject to the prior sentence. In the event that a
Member fails to pay any amounts owed to the Company pursuant to Section
10.3.C and this Section 10.4 when due, the Managing Member may elect to make
the payment to the Company on behalf of such defaulting Member, and in such
event shall be deemed to have loaned such amount to such defaulting Member
and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Company as against such
defaulting Member (including the right to receive distributions). Any amounts
payable (or portion thereof that remain unsatisfied) by a Member hereunder
shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at large United
States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , plus four (4) percentage points (but not higher than
the maximum lawful rate) from the date such amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15)
days after demand) until such amount is paid in full. Each Member shall take
such actions as the Company or the Managing Member shall request in order to
perfect or enforce the security interest created hereunder.

Section 10.5 _Organizational Expenses_. The Managing Member may cause the
Company to elect to deduct expenses, if any, incurred by it in organizing the
Company ratably over a 180-month period as provided in Code Section 709\.

Company or any Person who is related (within the meaning of Section 1.752-4(b)
of the Regulations) to any lender to the Company whose loan constitutes a

that as a condition to such consent, the Managing Member may require the
lender to enter into an arrangement with the Company and the Managing Member

which such lender would be deemed to be a member in the Company for purposes
of allocating liabilities to such lender under Code Section 752\.

 

Section 11.2 _Transfer of the Managing Member s Membership Interest_.

 

A. Subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Article 11, the

indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit, including any "qualified REIT
subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) and that
immediately following such Transfer owns, directly or indirectly, all the
assets of CLNS Credit and its Subsidiaries, without the Consent of any Member,
and may designate the transferee to become the new Managing Member under
Section 12.1, or (ii) in connection with a Termination Transaction as

the Company pursuant to the Act and this Agreement.

 

C. It is a condition to any Transfer of the entire Membership Interest of a

Agreement; (ii) the transferee assumes by operation of law or express
agreement all of the obligations of the transferor Managing Member under this
Agreement with respect to such Transferred Membership Interest; and (iii) the
transferee has executed such instruments as may be necessary to effectuate
such admission and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to be bound by
all the terms and provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Managing
Member and the admission of such transferee as a Managing Member.

 



73 Section 11.3 _Non-Managing Members Rights to Transfer_.

A. _General_. Subject to any Non-Managing Member Ancillary Agreement, each
Non-Managing Member, and each transferee of such Non-Managing Members
Membership Interest or Assignee thereof pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, may
not Transfer all or any portion of such Membership Interest to any Person
without the consent of the Managing Member, which consent may be withheld in
the Managing Members sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to Section 11.1.C and 11.3.C, any Non-Managing Member
may, at any time, without the consent of the Managing Member, Transfer all or
any portion of its Membership Interest pursuant to a Permitted
Transfer (including, in the case of a Non-Managing Member that is a Permitted
Lender Transferee, any Transfer of a Membership Interest to a Third-Party
Pledge Transferee). Any Transfer of a Membership Interest by a Non-Managing
Member or an Assignee is subject to Section 11.4 and to satisfaction of the
following conditions:



     | (1) | _Qualified Transferee_. Any Transfer of a Membership
Interest shall be made only to a single Qualified Transferee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for such purposes, all Qualified Transferees that
are Affiliates, or that comprise investment accounts or funds managed by a
single Qualified Transferee and its Affiliates, shall be considered together
to be a single Qualified Transferee. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | _Opinion of Counsel_. The transferor shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Managing Member an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to it to the effect that the proposed Transfer may be
effected without registration under the Securities Act and will not otherwise
violate the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder or violate any state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Company or the Membership Interests Transferred; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Managing Member may waive this condition upon the
request of the transferor. If, in the opinion of such counsel, such Transfer
would require the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act
or would otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Company or the Membership Units, the Managing Member may
prohibit any Transfer otherwise permitted under this _Section 11.3_ by a
Non-Managing Member of Membership Interests. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | _Minimum Transfer Restriction_. Any Transferring Member
must Transfer not less than the lesser of (i) Five Hundred (500) Membership
Units or (ii) all of the remaining Membership Units owned by
such Transferring Member; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of
determining compliance with the foregoing restriction, all Membership Units
owned by Affiliates of a Member shall be considered to be owned by such
Member.  
---|---|--- 
 



74 It is a condition to any Transfer otherwise permitted hereunder that the
transferee assumes by operation of law or express agreement all of the
obligations of the transferor Member under this Agreement with respect to such
Transferred Membership Interest, and no such Transfer (other than pursuant to
a statutory merger or consolidation wherein all obligations and liabilities
of the transferor Member are assumed by a successor corporation by operation
of law) shall relieve the transferor Member of its obligations under this
Agreement without the approval of the Managing Member. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any transferee of any Transferred Membership Interest shall be
subject to any and all ownership limitations (including the Ownership Limit)
contained in the Charter that may limit or restrict such transferees ability
to exercise its Redemption rights, including the Ownership Limit. Any
transferee, whether or not admitted as a Substituted Member, shall take
subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder. Unless admitted as a
Substituted Member, no transferee, whether by a voluntary Transfer, by
operation of law or otherwise, shall have any rights hereunder, other than the
rights of an Assignee as provided in Section 11.5 hereof.

 

B. _Incapacity_. If a Non-Managing Member is subject to Incapacity, the
executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or
receiver of such Members estate shall have all the rights of a Non-Managing
Member, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Non-Managing Members,
for the purpose of settling or managing the estate, and such power as the
Incapacitated Member possessed to Transfer all or any part of its interest in
the Company. The Incapacity of a Member, in and of itself, shall not dissolve
or terminate the Company.

C. _Adverse Tax Consequences_. No Transfer by a Non-Managing Member of its
Membership Interests (including any Redemption, any other acquisition of
Membership Units by the Managing Member or any acquisition of Membership Units
by the Company and including any Permitted Transfer) may be made to or by any
Person if on the advice of legal counsel for the Company, (i) such Transfer
would create a material risk of the Company being treated as an association
taxable as a corporation, (ii) there would be a material risk that such
Transfer would be treated as effectuated through an "established securities
market" or a "secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof),"
within the meaning of Code Section 7704 or otherwise create a material risk
of the Company being treated as a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Code Section 469(k)(2) or Code Section 7704, (iii) such Transfer
would create a material risk that the Company cease to be classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes (except as a result of the
Redemption (or acquisition by CLNS Credit) of all Membership Units held by all
Members (other than CLNS Credit)), or such Transfer would result in a
termination of the Company under Code Section 708(b)(1)(B), or (iv) such
Transfer would create a material risk that CLNS Credit would cease to comply
with the REIT Requirements or any wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit
to cease to qualify as either a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the
meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) or disregarded entity (determined for
federal income tax purposes) thereof.

 



75 Section 11.4 _Substituted Members_.

 

A. A transferee of the interest of a Non-Managing Member shall be admitted as
a Substituted Member only with the consent of the Managing Member, which may
be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion. The failure or refusal by the
Managing Member to permit a transferee of any such interests to become a
Substituted Member shall not give rise to any cause of action against the
Company or the Managing Member. Subject to the foregoing, an Assignee shall
not be admitted as a Substituted Member until and unless it furnishes to the
Managing Member (i) evidence of acceptance, in form and substance
satisfactory to CLNS Credit, of all the terms, conditions and applicable
obligations of this Agreement, (ii) a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement executed by such Assignee and (iii) such other documents and
instruments as the Managing Member may require to effect such Assignees
admission as a Substituted Member.

B. Concurrently with, and as evidence of, the admission of a Substituted
Member, the Managing Member shall amend the Register and the books and records
of the Company to reflect the name, address and number of Membership Units of
such Substituted Member and to eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name,
address and number of Membership Units of the predecessor of such Substituted
Member.

C. A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance
with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and be subject to
all the restrictions and liabilities of a Non-Managing Member under
this Agreement.

Section 11.5 _Assignees_. If the Managing Member withholds its consent for the
admission of any transferee as a Substituted Member, as described in Section
11.4 hereof, such transferee shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of
this Agreement. An Assignee shall be entitled to all the rights of an assignee
of a membership interest under the Act, including the right to receive
distributions from the Company and the share of Net Income, Net Losses and
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company
attributable to the Membership Units assigned to such transferee and
the rights to Transfer the Membership Units provided in this Article 11, but
shall not be deemed to be a holder of Membership Units for any other purpose
under this Agreement (other than as expressly provided in Section 15.1 hereof
with respect to a Qualifying Party that becomes a Tendering Party), and shall
not be entitled to effect a Consent or vote with respect to such Membership
Units on any matter presented to the Non-Managing Members for approval (such
right to Consent or vote, to the extent provided in this Agreement or under
the Act, fully remaining with the transferor Member). In the event that any
such transferee desires to make a further assignment of any such
Membership Units, such transferee shall be subject to all the provisions of
this Article 11 to the same extent and in the same manner as any Non-Managing
Member desiring to make an assignment of Membership Units. 

Section 11.6 _General Provisions_.

 

A. No Non-Managing Member may withdraw from the Company other than: (i) as a
result of a permitted Transfer of all of such Members Membership Interest in
accordance with this Article 11 with respect to which the transferee becomes a
Substituted Member; (ii) pursuant to a redemption (or acquisition by the
Managing Member or CLNS Credit) of all of its Membership Interest pursuant to
a Redemption under Section 15.1 hereof and/or pursuant to any Membership Unit
Designation; or (iii) as a result of the acquisition by the Managing Member or
CLNS Credit of all of such Members Membership Interest, whether or not
pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof.

 



76 B. Any Member who shall Transfer all of its Membership Units in a Transfer (i)
permitted pursuant to this Article 11 where such transferee was admitted as a
Substituted Member, (ii) pursuant to the exercise of its rights to effect a
redemption of all of its Membership Units pursuant to a Redemption under
Section 15.1 hereof and/or pursuant to any Membership Unit Designation, or
(iii) to CLNS Credit, whether or not pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof, shall
cease to be a Member.

 

C. If any Membership Unit is Transferred in compliance with the provisions of
this Article 11, or is redeemed by the Company, or acquired by CLNS Credit
pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof, on any day other than the first day of a
Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item thereof and all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to such
Membership Unit for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the transferor
Member or the Tendering Party (as the case may be) and, in the case of a
Transfer or assignment other than a Redemption, to the transferee Member, by
taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal Year in
accordance with Code Section 706(d), using the "interim closing of the books"
method or another permissible method selected by the Managing Member. Solely
for purposes of making such allocations, each of such items for the calendar
month in which a Transfer occurs shall be allocated to the transferee Member
and none of such items for the calendar month in which a Transfer or a
Redemption occurs shall be allocated to the transferor Member, or the
Tendering Party (as the case may be) if such Transfer occurs on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month, otherwise such items shall be allocated to
the transferor. All distributions of Available Cash attributable to such
Membership Unit with respect to which the Company Record Date is before the
date of such Transfer, assignment or Redemption shall be made to the
transferor Member or the Tendering Party (as the case may be) and, in the case
of a Transfer other than a Redemption, all distributions of Available Cash
thereafter attributable to such Membership Unit shall be made to the
transferee Member.

D. In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer herein contained or
contained in any applicable Non-Managing Member Ancillary Agreement, in no
event may any Transfer or assignment of a Membership Interest by any Member
(including any Redemption, any acquisition of Membership Units by CLNS Credit
or any other acquisition of Membership Units by the Company) be made without
the consent of the Managing Member, which may be withheld in its sole and
absolute discretion: (i) to any person or entity who lacks the legal right,
power or capacity to own a Membership Interest; (ii) in violation of
applicable law; (iii) of any component portion of a Membership Interest, such
as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions, separate and apart from
all other components of a Membership Interest; (iv) in the event that such
Transfer would create a material risk that CLNS Credit would cease to comply
with the REIT Requirements or any wholly owned Subsidiary of CLNS Credit to
cease to qualify as either a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning
of Code Section 856(i)(2)) or disregarded entity (determined for federal
income tax purposes) thereof; (v) if such Transfer would create a material
risk that the Company cease to be classified as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption (or acquisition by
CLNS Credit) of all Membership Units held by all Members (other than CLNS
Credit)), or such transfer would result

 



77  in a termination of the Company under Code Section 708(b)(1)(B); (vi) if
such Transfer would cause the Company to become, with respect to any employee
benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined
in ERISA Section 3(14)) or with respect to a plan subject to Section 4975 of
the Code, a "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(c)); (vii)
if such Transfer would, on the advice of legal counsel to the Company, cause
any portion of the assets of the Company to constitute assets of any employee
benefit plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section 2510.3-101,
as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA; (viii) if such Transfer requires the
registration of such Membership Interest pursuant to any applicable federal
or state securities laws; (ix) if such Transfer would create a material risk
that the Company would become a "publicly traded partnership," as such term is
defined in Code Section 469(k)(2) or Code Section 7704(b) or would otherwise
create a material risk that the Company would be treated as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes; (x) if such Transfer would cause the Company to
have more than one hundred (100) partners for tax purposes (including as
partners those persons indirectly owning an interest in the Company through a
partnership, limited liability company, subchapter S corporation or grantor
trust); (xi) if such Transfer would cause the Company to become a reporting
company under the Exchange Act; (xii) if such Transfer subjects the Company to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors
Act of 1940 or ERISA.

 

E. Transfers by a Non-Managing Member pursuant to this Article 11 or pursuant
to any applicable Non-Managing Member Ancillary Agreement but not pursuant to
Article 15, other than a Permitted Transfer to a Permitted Transferee pursuant
to the exercise of remedies under a Pledge, may only be made on the first day
of a fiscal quarter of the Company, unless the Managing Member otherwise
agrees.

Section 11.7 _Restrictions on Termination Transactions_. Neither CLNS Credit
nor the Managing Member shall engage in, or cause or permit, a Termination
Transaction, unless the conditions in at least one of the following paragraphs
is met:

 

A. the Consent of the Non-Managing Members is obtained;

for each Membership Common Unit, an amount of cash, securities or other
property equal to the product of the Adjustment Factor and the greatest amount
of cash, securities or other property paid to a holder of one REIT Share in
consideration of one REIT Share pursuant to the terms of such Termination
Transaction; _provided_ that if, in connection with such Termination
Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange offer shall have been made to and
accepted by the holders of a majority of the outstanding REIT Shares, each
holder of Membership Common Units (other than CLNS Credit and its wholly owned
subsidiaries) will receive, or will have the right to elect to receive, the
greatest amount of cash, securities or other property that such holder of
Membership Common Units would have received had it exercised its right to
Redemption pursuant to Article 15 hereof and received REIT Shares in
exchange for its Membership Common Units immediately prior to the expiration
of such purchase, tender or exchange offer and had thereupon accepted such
purchase, tender or exchange offer and then such Termination Transaction shall
have been consummated (the fair market value, at the time of the Termination
Transaction, of the amount specified herein with respect to each Membership
Common Unit is referred to as the " _Transaction Consideration_ ");

 



78 C. all of the following conditions are met: (i) substantially all of the
assets directly or indirectly owned by the Company prior to the announcement
of the Termination Transaction are, immediately after the Termination
Transaction, owned directly or indirectly by the Company or another limited

statutory limited liability for its non-managing equity owners that is the
survivor of a merger, consolidation or combination of assets with the Company
(in each case, the " _Surviving Company_ "); (ii) the Surviving Company is

of this Agreement for either: (1) a number of such REITs Publicly Traded
common equity securities with a fair market value, as of the date of
consummation of such Termination Transaction, equal to the Transaction
Consideration, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially comparable
to those set forth in the definition of "Adjustment Factor" herein (the "
_Successor Shares Amount_ "); or (2) cash in an amount equal to the fair
market value of the Successor Shares Amount at the time of such redemption,
determined in a manner consistent with the determination of the "Cash Amount"
herein; or (y) if CLNS Credit or its successor is not a REIT with a single
class of Publicly Traded common equity securities, the right to redeem their
interests in the Surviving Company on terms substantially comparable to those
in Section 15.1 of this Agreement for cash in an amount equal to the
Transaction Consideration; or

 

D. in any Termination Transaction that is a merger, consolidation or other
combination with or into another Person, immediately following
the consummation of such Termination Transaction, the equity holders of the
surviving entity are substantially identical to the shareholders of CLNS
Credit prior to such transaction.

Section 12.1 _Admission of Successor Managing Member_. A successor to all or a
portion of the Managing Members Membership Interest pursuant to Section
11.2.A hereof who the Managing Member has designated to become a successor
Managing Member shall be admitted to the Company as the Managing Member,
effective immediately upon the Transfer of such Membership Interest to it.
Upon any such Transfer and the admission of any such transferee as a successor
Managing Member in accordance with this Section 12.1, the transferor Managing
Member shall be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement and shall
cease to be a Managing Member without any separate Consent of the Members or
the consent or approval of any Member. Any such successor shall carry on the
business of the Company without dissolution. In each case, the
admission shall be subject to the successor Managing Member executing and
delivering to the Company an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and such other documents or instruments as may be required to
effect the admission.

 



79 In the event that the Managing Member withdraws from the Company, or transfers
its entire Membership Interest, in violation of this Agreement, or otherwise
dissolves or terminates or ceases to be the Managing Member, a Majority in
Interest of the Non-Managing Members may elect to continue the Company by
selecting a successor Managing Member in accordance with Section 13.1.A
hereof.

Section 12.2 _Admission of Additional Members_.

 

A. A Person (other than an existing Member) who makes a Capital Contribution
to the Company in exchange for Membership Units in accordance with this
Agreement shall be admitted to the Company as an Additional Member only upon
furnishing to the Managing Member (i) evidence of acceptance, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Managing Member, of all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the power of attorney granted in
Section 2.4 hereof, (ii) a counterpart signature page to this Agreement
executed by such Person, and (iii) such other documents or instruments as may
be required by the Managing Member in order to effect such Persons admission
as an Additional Member. Concurrently with, and as evidence of, the admission
of an Additional Member, the Managing Member shall amend the Register and the
books and records of the Company to reflect the name, address, number and
type of Membership Units of such Additional Member.

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.2, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Member without the consent of the Managing
Member. The admission of any Person as an Additional Member shall become
effective on the date upon which the name of such Person is recorded on the
books and records of the Company, following the consent of the Managing Member
to such admission and the satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in
Section 12.2.A.

 

C. If any Additional Member is admitted to the Company on any day other than
the first day of a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item
thereof and all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
allocable among Holders for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated among such
Additional Member and all other Holders by taking into account their varying
interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code Section 706(d),
using the "interim closing of the books" method or another permissible method
selected by the Managing Member. Solely for purposes of making such
allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which an admission
of any Additional Member occurs shall be allocated among all the Holders
including such Additional Member, in accordance with the principles described
in Section 11.6.C hereof. All distributions of Available Cash with respect to
which the Company Record Date is before the date of such admission shall be

prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate and may for this purpose
exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof.

 



80 Section 12.4 _Limit on Number of Members_. Unless otherwise permitted by the
Managing Member, no Person shall be admitted to the Company as an Additional
Member if the effect of such admission would be to cause the Company to have a
number of Members (including as Members for this purpose those Persons
indirectly owning an interest in the Company through another limited
liability company, a partnership, a subchapter S corporation or a grantor
trust) that would cause the Company to become a reporting company under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 12.5 _Admission_. A Person shall be admitted to the Company as a
member of the Company and/or a managing member of the Company only upon
strict compliance, and not upon substantial compliance, with the requirements

ARTICLE 13

DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION

Section 13.1 _Dissolution_. The Company shall not be dissolved by the
admission of Substituted Members or Additional Members, or by the admission
of a successor managing member in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Upon the withdrawal of the Managing Member, any successor managing member
shall continue the business of the Company without dissolution. However, the
Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon the first to
occur of any of the following (each, a " _Liquidating Event_ "):

 

A. an event of withdrawal, as defined in the Act, with respect to a Managing
Member, unless (i) at the time of the occurrence of such event, there is at
least one remaining managing member of the Company who is authorized to and
shall carry on the business of the Company, or (ii) within ninety (90) days
after the withdrawal, a Majority in Interest of the Non-Managing Members
agree in writing to continue the Company and to the appointment, effective as
of the date of withdrawal, of a successor managing member;

 

B. an election to dissolve the Company made by the Managing Member, with or
without the Consent of the other Members; or

 

C. entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company pursuant to the
provisions of the Act.

 

Section 13.2 _Winding Up_.

 

A. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Company shall continue
solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner,
liquidating its assets and satisfying the claims of its creditors and the
Holders. After the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, no Holder shall take any
action that is inconsistent with the winding up of the Companys business
and affairs. The Managing Member (or, in the event that there is no remaining
Managing Member or the Managing Member has dissolved, become bankrupt or
ceased to operate, any Person elected by a Majority in Interest of the Non-
Managing Members (the

 



81  Managing Member or such other Person being referred to herein as the "
_Liquidator_ ")) shall be responsible for overseeing the winding up and
dissolution of the Company and shall take full account of the Companys
liabilities and property, and the Company property shall be liquidated as
promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and the
proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by the Managing
Member, include shares of stock in CLNS Credit) shall be applied and
distributed in the following order:



     | (1) | First, to the satisfaction of all of the Companys debts and
liabilities to creditors (including, without limitation, the Holders) (whether
by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | Second, subject to the terms of any Membership Unit
Designations, the balance, if any, to the Holders in accordance with and in
proportion to their positive Capital Account balances, after giving effect to
all contributions, distributions and allocations for all periods. 
---|---|--- 

The Managing Member shall not receive any additional compensation for
any services performed pursuant to this Article 13\.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2.A hereof that
require liquidation of the assets of the Company, but subject to the order of
priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the Company,
the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the
Companys assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Holders, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer for a
reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy liabilities of the Company (including to those Holders as creditors)
and/or distribute to the Holders, in lieu of cash, as tenants in common and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2.A hereof, undivided interests
in such Company assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation.
Any such distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith
judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best
interest of the Holders, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to
the disposition and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems
reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such
properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value
of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation
as it may adopt.

C. In the event that the Company is "liquidated," within the meaning of
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made pursuant
to this Article 13 to the Holders that have positive Capital Accounts in
compliance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2) to the extent of,
and in proportion to, positive Capital Account balances. If any Holder has a
deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including
the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Holder shall have no
obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company with respect
to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed to the
Company or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever. In the sole and
absolute discretion of the Managing Member or the Liquidator, a pro rata
portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the Holders
pursuant to this Article 13 may be:

 



82 the Managing Member and the Holders for the purpose of liquidating Company
assets, collecting amounts owed to the Company, and paying any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Company or of the Managing
Member arising out of or in connection with the Company and/or Company
activities. The assets of any such trust shall be distributed to the Holders,
from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the Managing Member, in
the same proportions and amounts as would otherwise have been distributed to
the Holders pursuant to this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for
Company liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized
portion of any installment obligations owed to the Company; _provided_ that
such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the Holders in the
manner and order of priority set forth in Section 13.2.A hereof as soon as
practicable. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 13.3 _Deemed Contribution and Distribution_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Article 13, in the event that the Company is liquidated
within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), but no
Liquidating Event has occurred, the Companys Property shall not be
liquidated, the Companys liabilities shall not be paid or discharged and the
Companys affairs shall not be wound up. Instead, for federal income tax
purposes the Company shall be deemed to have contributed all of its assets and
liabilities to a new partnership in exchange for an interest in the new
partnership; and immediately thereafter, distributed Membership Units to the
Members in the new partnership in accordance with their respective Capital
Accounts in liquidation of the Company, and the new partnership is deemed to
continue the business of the Company. Nothing in this Section 13.3 shall be
deemed to have constituted any Assignee as a Substituted Member without
compliance with the provisions of Section 11.4 hereof.

 

Section 13.4 _Rights of Holders_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and subject to the rights of any Holder of any Membership Interest
set forth in a Membership Unit Designation, (a) each Holder shall look solely
to the assets of the Company for the return of its Capital Contribution, (b)
no Holder shall have the right or power to demand or receive property other
than cash from the Company, and (c) no Holder shall have priority over any
other Holder as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions or
allocations.

 

Section 13.5 _Notice of Dissolution_. In the event that a Liquidating Event
occurs or an event occurs that would, but for an election or objection by one
or more Members pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof, result in a dissolution of
the Company, CLNS Credit or the Liquidator shall, within thirty (30) days
thereafter, provide written notice thereof to each of the Holders and, in the
sole and absolute discretion of CLNS Credit or the Liquidator, or as required
by the Act, to all

 



83  other parties with whom the Company regularly conducts business (as
determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Managing Member or the
Liquidator), and the Managing Member or the Liquidator may, or, if required
by the Act, shall, publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in each place in which the Company regularly conducts business (as
determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Managing Member or the
Liquidator).

Section 13.6 _Cancellation of Certificate of Formation_. Upon the completion
of the liquidation of the Company cash and property as provided in Section
13.2 hereof, the Company shall be terminated, a certificate of cancellation
shall be filed with the State of Delaware, all qualifications of the Company
as a foreign limited liability company in jurisdictions other than the State
of Delaware shall be cancelled, and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Company shall be taken.

 

Section 13.7 _Reasonable Time for Winding-Up_. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business and affairs of the Company
and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 13.2 hereof, in order to
minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding-up, and the
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect between and among the
Members during the period of liquidation.

 

ARTICLE 14

PROCEDURES FOR ACTIONS AND CONSENTS

OF MEMBERS; AMENDMENTS; MEETINGS

 

Section 14.1 _Actions and Consents of Members_. The actions requiring Consent
of any Member pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 7.3 hereof, or
otherwise pursuant to applicable law, are subject to the procedures set forth
in this Article 14\.

 

Section 14.2 _Amendments_. Except as otherwise required, permitted or
prohibited by this Agreement (including Section 7.3 and Section 4.4.E),
amendments to this Agreement must be approved by the Consent of the Managing
Member and, if the amendment substantively and adversely affects the rights of
the Non-Managing Members disproportionately as compared to the Managing
Member, the Consent of the Non-Managing Members, and may be proposed only by
(a) the Managing Member, or (b) Non-Managing Members holding a majority of
the Membership Common Units then held by Non-Managing Members (excluding CLNS
Credit and any Controlled Entity of CLNS Credit). Following such proposal,
the Managing Member shall submit to the Members any proposed amendment that,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, requires the Consent of the Members.
The Managing Member shall seek the Consent of the Members entitled to vote
thereon on any such proposed amendment in accordance with Section 14.3 hereof.
Upon obtaining any such Consent, or any other Consent required by this
Agreement, and without further action or execution by any other Person,
including any Member, (i) any amendment to this Agreement may be implemented
and reflected in a writing executed solely by the Managing Member, and (ii)
the Non-Managing Members shall be deemed a party to and bound by such
amendment of this Agreement. Within thirty (30) days after the effectiveness
of any amendment to this Agreement that does not receive the Consent of all
Members, the Managing Member shall deliver a copy of such amendment to all
Members that did not Consent to such amendment. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may
not be amended without the Consent of the Managing Member.

 



84 Section 14.3 _Procedures for Meetings and Actions of the Members_.

 

A. Meetings of the Members may be called only by the Managing Member. The call
shall state the nature of the business to be transacted. Notice of any such
meeting shall be given to all Members entitled to act at the meeting not less
than ten (10) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such
meeting. Members may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.
Unless approval by a different number or proportion of the Members is
required by this Agreement, or any Membership Unit Designation, the
affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Members shall be sufficient
to approve such proposal at a meeting of the Members. Whenever the Consent of
any Members is permitted or required under this Agreement, such Consent may be
given at a meeting of Members or in accordance with the procedure prescribed
in Section 14.3.B hereof.

 

B. Any action requiring the Consent of any Member or a group of Members
pursuant to this Agreement, or that is required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting if a Consent in writing
or by electronic transmission setting forth the action so taken or consented
to is given by Members whose affirmative vote would be sufficient to approve
such action or provide such Consent at a meeting of the Members. Such Consent
may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall have the same
force and effect as the affirmative vote of such Members at a meeting of the
Members. Such Consent shall be filed with the Managing Member. An action so
taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the effective
date so certified. For purposes of obtaining a Consent in writing or by
electronic transmission, the Managing Member may require a response within a
reasonable specified time, but not less than fifteen (15) days, and failure to
respond in such time period shall constitute a Consent that is consistent with
the Managing Members recommendation with respect to the proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , that an action shall become effective at such time as requisite
Consents are received even if prior to such specified time.

 

C. Each Member entitled to act at a meeting of Members may authorize any
Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Member is
entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or
participating at a meeting. Each proxy must be signed by the Member or
its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven
(11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy (or
there is receipt of a proxy authorizing a later date). Every proxy shall be
revocable at the pleasure of the Member executing it, such revocation to be
effective upon the Companys receipt of written notice of such revocation from
the Member executing such proxy, unless such proxy states that it is
irrevocable and is coupled with an interest.

D. The Managing Member may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of
determining the Members (i) entitled to Consent to any action, (ii) entitled
to receive notice of or vote at any meeting of the Members or (iii) in order
to make a determination of Members for any other proper purpose. Such date,
in any case, shall not be prior to the close of business on the day the record
date is fixed and shall be not more than ninety (90) days and, in the case of
a

 



85  meeting of the Members, not less than ten (10) days, before the date on
which the meeting is to be held. If no record date is fixed, the record date
for the determination of Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the Members shall be at the close of business on the day on which
the notice of the meeting is sent, and the record date for any other
determination of Members shall be the effective date of such Member action,
distribution or other event. When a determination of the Members entitled to
vote at any meeting of the Members has been made as provided in this section,
such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

 

E. Each meeting of Members shall be conducted by the Managing Member or such
other Person as the Managing Member may appoint pursuant to such rules for
the conduct of the meeting as the Managing Member or such other Person deems
appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. Without limitation, meetings
of Members may be conducted in the same manner as meetings of CLNS
Credits stockholders and may be held at the same time as, and as part of,
the meetings of CLNS Credits stockholders.

ARTICLE 15

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 15.1 _Redemption Rights of Qualifying Parties_.

 

A. Subject to any Non-Managing Member Ancillary Agreement, a Qualifying Party
shall have the right (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein)
to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the Membership Common
Units held by such Qualifying Party (Membership Common Units that have in fact
been tendered for redemption being hereafter referred to as " _Tendered
Units_ ") in exchange (a " _Redemption_ ") for the Cash Amount payable on the
Specified Redemption Date. Any Redemption shall be exercised pursuant to a
Notice of Redemption delivered to the Managing Member by the Qualifying Party
when exercising the Redemption right (the " _Tendering Party_ "). The
Companys obligation to effect a Redemption, however, shall not arise or be
binding against the Company (i) until and unless CLNS Credit declines or
fails to exercise its purchase rights pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof
following receipt of a Notice of Redemption (a " _Declination_ ") and (ii)
unless CLNS Credit agrees otherwise, until the Business Day following the
Cut-Off Date. In the event of a Redemption, the Cash Amount shall be delivered
as a certified or bank check payable to the Tendering Party or, in the
Managing Members sole and absolute discretion, in immediately available
funds on or before the Specified Redemption Date.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15.1.A hereof, on or before the
close of business on the Cut-Off Date, CLNS Credit may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, elect to acquire some or all of the Tendered Units (the
percentage of the Tendered Units so elected to be acquired, the " _Applicable
Percentage_ ") from the Tendering Party in exchange for the product of the
REIT Shares Amount and the Applicable Percentage. If CLNS Credit so elects,
on the Specified Redemption Date the Tendering Party shall sell such number
of the Tendered Units to CLNS Credit in exchange for a number of Class A REIT
Shares equal to the product of the REIT Shares Amount and the Applicable
Percentage. The Tendering Party shall submit (i) such information,
certification or affidavit as CLNS Credit may reasonably require in connection
with the application of the Ownership Limit to any such acquisition and (ii)
such 

 



86  written representations, investment letters, legal opinions or other
instruments necessary, in CLNS Credits view, to effect compliance with the
Securities Act. In the event of a purchase of the Tendered Units by CLNS
Credit pursuant to this Section 15.1.B, the Tendering Party shall no longer
have the right to cause the Company to effect a Redemption of such Tendered
Units, and, upon notice to the Tendering Party by CLNS Credit, given on or
before the close of business on the Cut-Off Date, that CLNS Credit has elected
to acquire some or all of the Tendered Units pursuant to this Section 15.1.B,
the obligation of the Company to effect a Redemption of the Tendered Units as
to which CLNS Credits notice relates shall not accrue or arise. A number of
Class A REIT Shares equal to the product of the Applicable Percentage and the
REIT Shares Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered by CLNS Credit as duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Class A REIT Shares
and, if applicable, Rights, free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or
restriction, other than the Ownership Limit and other restrictions provided
in the Charter, the Securities Act and relevant state securities or "blue sky"
laws. If the amount of Class A REIT Shares to be issued in exchange for the
Tendered Units is not a whole number of Class A REIT Shares, the Tendering
Party shall be paid (i) that number of Class A REIT Shares that equals the
nearest whole number less than such amount plus (ii) an amount of cash that
CLNS Credit determines, in its reasonable discretion, to represent the fair
value of the remaining fractional Class A REIT Share that would otherwise be
payable to the Tendering Party. Neither any Tendering Party whose Tendered
Units are acquired by CLNS Credit pursuant to this Section 15.1.B, any
Member, any Assignee nor any other interested Person shall have any right to
require or cause CLNS Credit to register, qualify or list any Class A REIT
Shares owned or held by such Person, whether or not such Class A REIT Shares
are issued pursuant to this Section 15.1.B, with the SEC, with any state
securities commissioner, department or agency, under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or with any stock exchange; provided, however, that this
limitation shall not be in derogation of any registration or similar rights
granted pursuant to any other written agreement (including any Non-Managing
Member Ancillary Agreement) between CLNS Credit and any such Person.
Notwithstanding any delay in such delivery, the Tendering Party shall be
deemed the owner of such Class A REIT Shares and Rights for all purposes,
including rights to vote or consent, receive dividends, and exercise rights,
as of the Specified Redemption Date. Class A REIT Shares issued upon an
acquisition of the Tendered Units by CLNS Credit pursuant to this Section
15.1.B may contain such legends regarding restrictions under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws as CLNS Credit in good faith
determines to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with
such laws and the Charter.

 

C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1.A, 15.1.B and 15.1.J
hereof, (i) no Person shall be entitled to effect a Redemption for cash or an
exchange for Class A REIT Shares to the extent the ownership or right to
acquire Class A REIT Shares pursuant to such exchange on the Specified
Redemption Date could cause such Person (or any other Person) to violate the
Ownership Limit, after giving effect to any waivers or modifications of such
restrictions by the Board of Directors, and (ii) no Person shall have any
rights under this Agreement to acquire Class A REIT Shares which
would otherwise be prohibited under the Charter, after giving effect to any
waivers or modifications of such restrictions by the Board of Directors.

 

D. In the event of a Declination:

 



87 Tendering Party on or before the close of business on the Cut-Off Date. The
failure of CLNS Credit to give notice of such Declination by the close of
business on the Cut-Off Date shall be deemed to be an election by CLNS Credit
to acquire the Tendered Units in exchange for REIT Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | The Company may elect to raise funds for the payment of the
Cash Amount either (a) by requiring that CLNS Credit contribute to the Company
funds from the proceeds of a registered public offering by CLNS Credit
of Class A REIT Shares sufficient to purchase the Tendered Units or (b) from
any other sources (including the sale of any Property and the incurrence of
additional Debt) available to the Company. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | If the Cash Amount is not paid on or before the Specified
Redemption Date, interest shall accrue with respect to the Cash Amount from
the day after the Specified Redemption Date to and including the date on which
the Cash Amount is paid at a rate equal to the Applicable Federal Short-Term
Rate as published monthly by the IRS. 
---|---|--- 

E. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15.1.B hereof or Section 15.1.J
hereof, if CLNS Credits acquisition of Tendered Units in exchange for the
REIT Shares Amount would be prohibited under the Charter, then (i) CLNS
Credit shall not elect to acquire such Tendered Units, and (ii) the Company
shall not be obligated to effect a Redemption of such Tendered Units. For the
avoidance of doubt, unless CLNS Credits acquisition of Tendered Units in
exchange for the REIT Shares Amount would be prohibited under the Charter, if
Tendered Units are not exchanged for Class A REIT Shares, then the Cash Amount
will be paid to the Tendering Party in accordance with the terms of Section
15.1.A hereof.

 

F. Each Non-Managing Member covenants and agrees that all Membership Common
Units delivered for redemption shall be delivered to the Company or CLNS
Credit, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens; and, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither CLNS Credit nor the Company
shall be under any obligation to acquire Membership Common Units that are or
may be subject to any liens. Each Non-Managing Member further agrees that, if
any stamp, recording, documentary or similar tax is payable with respect to
the Membership Common Units as a result of the transfer thereof to the
Company or the CLNS Credit, such Tendering Party shall assume and pay such
tax.

 

G. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to Section
15.1.C hereof), with respect to any Redemption (or any tender of Membership
Common Units for Redemption if the Tendered Units are acquired by CLNS Credit
pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof) pursuant to this Section 15.1:

 



88 Party may effect a Redemption for less than Five Hundred (500) Membership
Common Units or, if such Tendering Party holds less than Five Hundred (500)
Membership Common Units, all of the Membership Common Units held by such
Tendering Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | If (i) a Tendering Party surrenders Tendered Units during
the period after the Company Record Date with respect to a distribution
payable to Holders of Membership Common Units, and before the record
date established by CLNS Credit for a dividend to its stockholders of some or
all of its portion of such Company distribution, and (ii) CLNS Credit acquires
any of such Tendered Units in exchange for Class A REIT Shares pursuant
to Section 15.1.B on or before the record date for CLNS Credit dividends,
then such Tendering Party shall pay to CLNS Credit on the Specified Redemption
Date an amount in cash equal to the Company distribution paid or payable in
respect of such Tendered Units acquired by CLNS Credit. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | The consummation of such Redemption (or an acquisition of
Tendered Units by CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof, as the case
may be) shall be subject to the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976. 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | The Tendering Party shall continue to own (subject, in the
case of an Assignee, to the provisions of Section 11.5 hereof) all Membership
Common Units subject to any Redemption, and be treated as a Member or
an Assignee, as applicable, with respect to such Membership Common Units for
all purposes of this Agreement, until the Specified Redemption Date and until
such Tendered Units are either paid for by the Company pursuant to Section
15.1.A hereof or transferred to CLNS Credit and paid for, by the issuance of
Class A REIT Shares, pursuant to Section 15.1.B. Until a Specified Redemption
Date and an acquisition of the Tendered Units by CLNS Credit pursuant to
Section 15.1.B hereof, the Tendering Party shall have no rights as a
stockholder of CLNS Credit with respect to the REIT Shares issuable in
connection with such acquisition. 
---|---|--- 
 

H. If CLNS Credit shall be a party to any Transaction, each Membership Common
Unit that is not converted into the right to receive cash, securities or
other property or any combination thereof in connection with such Transaction
shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of cash, securities
or other property or any combination thereof receivable upon the consummation
of such Transaction by a holder of that number of REIT Shares into

 



89  which one Membership Common Unit was convertible immediately prior to such
Transaction, assuming such holder of REIT Shares (i) is not a Constituent
Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person and (ii) failed to exercise
his or her rights of the election, if any, as to the kind and amount of cash,
securities or other property or any combination thereof receivable upon such
Transaction; _provided_ that if the cash, securities or other property or any
combination thereof receivable upon such Transaction is not the same for each
REIT Share held immediately prior to such Transaction by other than a
Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such
rights of election shall not have been exercised (" _Non-Electing Shares_"),
then for purposes of this Section 15.1.H the kind and amount of cash,
securities or other property or any combination thereof receivable upon such
Transaction by each Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and
amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-Electing Shares.
CLNS Credit shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms of such
Transaction are consistent with the provisions of this Section 15.1.H. The
provisions of this Section 15.1.H shall similarly apply to successive
Transactions.

I. In connection with the exercise of Redemption rights pursuant to this
Section 15.1, unless waived by CLNS Credit, the Tendering Party shall submit
the following to CLNS Credit, in addition to the Notice of Redemption:



     | (1) | A written affidavit, dated the same date as the Notice of
Redemption, (a) disclosing the Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership
(each as defined in the Charter), as determined for purposes of Code
Sections 856(a)(6) and 856(h), of REIT Shares by (i) such Tendering Party and
(ii) to the best of such Tendering Partys knowledge, any Related Party, and
(b) representing that, after giving effect to an acquisition of the Tendered
Units by CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof, neither the Tendering
Party nor, to the best of such Tendering Partys knowledge, any Related Party,
will Beneficially Own or Constructively Own (each as defined in the Charter)
REIT Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the written affidavit required pursuant to this Section 15.1.I(1) shall only
be required upon the reasonable request of CLNS Credit upon the good faith
determination by CLNS Credit that such affidavit is necessary to confirm that
the exercise of Redemption rights by the Tendering Party will not result in
the Tendering Partys Constructive Ownership or Beneficial Ownership (each as
defined in the Charter) of REIT Shares exceeding the Ownership Limit; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | A written representation that neither the Tendering Party
nor, to the best of such Tendering Partys knowledge, any Related Party, has
any intention to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership
(each as defined in the Charter) of any additional REIT Shares prior to the
Specified Redemption Date that would prevent the Tendering Party from making
the certification set forth in Section 15.1.I(3) below; 
---|---|--- 
 



90 closing of (i) the Redemption or (ii) the acquisition of the Tendered Units by
CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof on the Specified Redemption
Date, that either (a) the Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership
(each as defined in the Charter) of REIT Shares by the Tendering Party and, to
the best of such Tendering Partys knowledge, any Related Party,
remain unchanged from that disclosed in the affidavit required by Section
15.1.I(1), or (b) after giving effect to the Redemption or an acquisition of
the Tendered Units by CLNS Credit pursuant to Section 15.1.B hereof, neither
the Tendering Party nor, to the best of such Tendering Partys knowledge, any
Related Party, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own (each as defined
in the Charter) REIT Shares in violation of the Ownership Limit; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) | In connection with any Redemption, CLNS Credit shall have
the right to receive an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to
the effect that the proposed Redemption will not cause the Company, the
Managing Member or CLNS Credit to violate any Federal or state securities
laws or regulations applicable to the Redemption or the issuance and sale of
REIT Shares to the Tendering Party pursuant to Section 15.1.B of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 

J. _Stock Offering Funding Option_.



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    (1) |  | (a)  |  | Notwithstanding Sections 15.1.A or 15.1.B
hereof (but subject to Sections 15.1.C and 15.1.F hereof), if (i) a Non-
Managing Member has delivered to the Managing Member a Notice of Redemption
that would result in Excess Units (together with any other Tendered Units that
such Non-Managing Member agrees to treat as Excess Units, the " _Offering
Units_ "), and (ii) CLNS Credit is eligible to file a registration statement
under Form S-3 (or any successor form similar thereto), then CLNS Credit may
elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cause the Company to redeem
the Offering Units with the net proceeds of an offering, whether registered
under the Securities Act or exempt from such registration, underwritten,
offered and sold directly to investors or through agents or other
intermediaries, or otherwise distributed (a " _Stock Offering Funding_ ") of
a number of Class A REIT Shares (" _Offered Shares_ ") equal to or greater
than the REIT Shares Amount with respect to the Offering Units pursuant to the
terms of this Section 15.1.J. CLNS Credit must provide notice of their
exercise of the election described in clause (x) above to purchase the
Tendered Units through a Stock Offering Funding on or before the Cut-Off
Date. 
 



 



91 respect to a Notice of Redemption, the Managing Member may give notice (a "
_Single Funding Notice_ ") of such election to all Non-Managing Members and
require that all Members elect whether or not to effect a Redemption to be
funded through such Stock Offering Funding. If a Non-Managing Member
elects to effect such a Redemption, it shall give notice thereof and of the
number of Membership Common Units to be made subject thereto in writing to the
Managing Member within 10 Business Days after receipt of the Single Funding
Notice, and such Non-Managing Member shall be treated as a Tendering Party for
all purposes of this Section 15.1.J. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | If CLNS Credit elects a Stock Offering Funding, on the
Specified Redemption Date, the Company shall redeem each Offering Unit that is
still a Tendered Unit on such date for cash in immediately available funds in
an amount (the " _Stock Offering Funding Amount_ ") equal to the net proceeds
per Offered Share received by CLNS Credit from the Stock Offering Funding,
determined after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but no
other expenses of CLNS Credit or any other Non-Managing Member related
thereto, including legal and accounting fees and expenses, SEC registration
fees, state blue sky and securities laws fees and expenses,
printing expenses, FINRA filing fees, exchange listing fees and other out of
pocket expenses (the " _Net Proceeds_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | If CLNS Credit elects a Stock Offering Funding, the
following additional terms and conditions shall apply: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

As soon as practicable after CLNS Credit elects to effect a Stock Offering
Funding, CLNS Credit shall use its reasonable efforts to effect as promptly
as possible a registration, qualification or compliance (including the
execution of an undertaking to file post-effective amendments, appropriate
qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and
appropriate compliance with applicable regulations issued under the Securities
Act and any other governmental requirements or regulations) as would permit or
facilitate the sale and distribution of the Offered Shares;  _provided_ that,
if CLNS Credit shall deliver a certificate to the Tendering Party stating that
CLNS Credit has determined in the good faith 

---|---|--- 
 



92 registration or qualification would require disclosure of material non-public
information, the disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect on
CLNS Credit, then CLNS Credit may delay making any filing or delay the
effectiveness of any registration or qualification for the shorter of (a) the
period ending on the date upon which such information is disclosed to the
public or ceases to be material or (b) an aggregate period of ninety (90) days
in connection with any Stock Offering Funding. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | CLNS Credit shall advise each Tendering Party, regularly and
promptly upon any request, of the status of the Stock Offering Funding
process, including the timing of all filings, the selection of and
understandings with underwriters, agents, dealers and brokers, the nature and
contents of all communications with the SEC and other governmental bodies, the
expenses related to the Stock Offering Funding as they are being incurred, the
nature of marketing activities, and any other matters reasonably related to
the timing, price and expenses relating to the Stock Offering Funding and the
compliance by CLNS Credit with its obligations with respect thereto. CLNS
Credit will have reasonable procedures whereby the Tendering Party with the
largest number of Offering Units (the " _Lead Tendering Party_ ") may
represent all the Tendering Parties in connection with the Stock Offering
Funding by allowing it to participate in meetings with the underwriters of
the Stock Offering Funding. In addition, CLNS Credit and each Tendering Party
may, but shall be under no obligation to, enter into understandings in writing
(" _Pricing Agreements_ ") whereby the Tendering Party will agree in advance
as to the acceptability of a Net Proceeds amount at or below a specified
amount. Furthermore, CLNS Credit shall establish pricing notification
procedures with each such Tendering Party, such that the Tendering Party will
have the maximum opportunity practicable to determine whether to become a
Withdrawing Member pursuant to Section 15.1.J(3)(c) below. 
---|---|--- 
 



93 REIT Share in the Stock Offering Funding from the managing underwriter(s), in
the case of a registered public offering, or lead placement agent(s), in
the event of an unregistered offering, engaged by CLNS Credit in order to
sell the Offered Shares, shall immediately use its reasonable efforts to
notify each Tendering Party of the price per REIT Share in the Stock Offering
Funding and resulting Net Proceeds. Each Tendering Party shall have one hour
from the receipt of such written notice (as such time may be extended by CLNS
Credit) to elect to withdraw its Redemption (a Tendering Party making such an
election being a " _Withdrawing Member_ "), and Membership Common Units with
a REIT Shares Amount equal to such excluded Offered Shares shall be considered
to be withdrawn from the related Redemption; _provided_ , _however_ , that
CLNS Credit shall keep each of the Tendering Parties reasonably informed as
to the likely timing of delivery of its notice. If a Tendering Party, within
such time period, does not notify CLNS Credit of such Tendering Partys
election not to become a Withdrawing Member, then such Tendering Party shall,
except as otherwise provided in a Pricing Agreement, be deemed not to have
withdrawn from the Redemption, without liability to CLNS Credit. To the extent
that CLNS Credit is unable to notify any Tendering Party, such un-notified
Tendering Party shall, except as otherwise provided in any Pricing Agreement,
be deemed not to have elected to become a Withdrawing Member. Each Tendering
Party whose Redemption is being funded through the Stock Offering Funding who
does not become a Withdrawing Member shall have the right, subject to the
approval of the managing underwriter(s) or placement agent(s) and restrictions
of any applicable securities laws, to submit for Redemption additional
Membership Common Units in a number no greater than the number of Membership
Common Units withdrawn. If more than one Tendering Party so elects to redeem
additional Membership Common Units, then such Membership Common Units shall
be redeemed on a pro rata basis, based on the number of additional Membership
Common Units sought to be so redeemed. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

CLNS Credit shall take all reasonable action in order to effectuate the sale
of the Offered Shares including the entering into of an underwriting or
placement agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter(s) or
placement agent(s) selected for such underwriting. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if the managing underwriter(s) or placement
agent(s) advises CLNS Credit in writing that marketing factors require a
limitation of the number of shares to be offered, then CLNS Credit shall so
advise all Tendering Parties and the number  

---|---|--- 
 



94 to the Redemption shall be allocated among all Tendering Parties in
proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective number of Membership
Common Units as to which each Tendering Party elected to effect a Redemption.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if CLNS Credit is
also offering to sell shares for purposes other than to fund the redemption
of Offering Units and to pay related expenses, then those other shares may in
CLNS Credits sole and absolute discretion be given priority over any shares
to be sold in the Stock Offering Funding, and any shares to be sold in the
Stock Offering Funding shall be removed from the offering prior to removing
shares the proceeds of which would be used for other purposes of CLNS Credit.
No Offered Shares excluded from the underwriting by reason of the managing
underwriters or placement agents marketing limitation shall be included in
such offering. 
---|--- 

Section 15.2 _Addresses and Notice_. Any notice, demand, request or report
required or permitted to be given or made to a Member or Assignee under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made when delivered
in person or when sent by first class United States mail or by other means of
written or electronic communication (including by telecopy, facsimile,
electronic mail or commercial courier service) to the Member or Assignee at
the address for such Member set forth in the Register, or such other address
of which the Member shall notify the Managing Member in accordance with this
Section 15.2.

Section 15.3 _Titles and Captions_. All article or Section titles or captions
in this Agreement are for convenience only. They shall not be deemed part of
this Agreement and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions hereof.

 

Section 15.4 _Further Action_. The parties shall execute and deliver all
documents, provide all information and take or refrain from taking action as
may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 15.5 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

 

Section 15.6 _Waiver_.

 

A. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any
covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any
right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute waiver of
any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

 



95 B. The restrictions, conditions and other limitations on the rights and
benefits of the Members contained in this Agreement, and the duties,
covenants and other requirements of performance or notice by the Members, are
for the benefit of the Company and may be waived or relinquished by the
Managing Member, in its sole and absolute discretion, on behalf of the
Company in one or more instances from time to time and at any time; _provided_
, _however_ , that any such waiver or relinquishment may not be made if it
would have the effect of (i) creating liability for any other Member, (ii)
causing the Company to cease to qualify as a limited liability company, (iii)
reducing the amount of cash otherwise distributable to the Members (other than
any such reduction that affects all of the Members holding the same class or
series of Membership Units on a uniform or pro rata basis, if approved by a
Majority in Interest of the Non-Managing Members holding such class or series
of Membership Units), (iv) resulting in the classification of the Company as
an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation or (v)
violating the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state "blue sky" or
other securities laws; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any waiver relating to
compliance with the Ownership Limit or other restrictions in the Charter shall
be made and shall be effective only as provided in the Charter.

 

Section 15.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which together shall constitute one agreement binding on all the
parties hereto, notwithstanding that all such parties are not signatories to
the original or the same counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this
Agreement immediately upon affixing its signature hereto.

 

Section 15.8 _Applicable Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Jury Trial_.

 

A. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
the principles of conflicts of law. In the event of a conflict between any
provision of this Agreement and any non-mandatory provision of the Act, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control and take precedence.

B. Each Member hereby (i) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware
(collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), with respect to any dispute arising
out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby to the extent
such courts would have subject matter jurisdiction with respect to such
dispute, (ii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion,
defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of any of the Delaware Courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the action is
improper, (iii) agrees that notice or the service of process in any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered to such Member at such Members last known address as set forth in
the Companys books and records, and (iv) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



96 Section 15.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains all of the
understandings and agreements between and among the Members with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the rights, interests and obligations
of the Members with respect to the Company. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement or any Membership Unit Designation to the contrary, including
any provisions relating to amending this Agreement, the Members hereby
acknowledge and agree that the Managing Member, without the approval of any
other Member, may enter into side letters or similar written agreements with
Members that are not Affiliates of the Managing Member or CLNS Credit,
executed contemporaneously with the admission of such Member to the Company,
which may have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering
or supplementing the terms of, this Agreement or any Membership Unit
Designation, as negotiated with such Member and which the Managing Member in
its sole and absolute discretion deems necessary, desirable or appropriate.
The parties hereto agree that any terms, conditions or provisions contained
in such side letters or similar written agreements with a Member shall govern
with respect to such Member notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 15.10 _Invalidity of Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement
is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall
not be affected thereby.

 

Section 15.11 _Limitation to Preserve REIT Status_. Notwithstanding anything
else in this Agreement, with respect to any period in which CLNS Credit has
elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, to the extent
that the amount paid, credited, distributed or reimbursed by the Company to
any REIT Member or its officers, directors, employees or agents, whether as a
reimbursement, fee, expense or indemnity (a " _REIT Payment_ "), would
constitute gross income to the REIT Member (as determined for purposes of Code
Section 856(c)(2) or Code Section 856(c)(3)), then, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the amount of such REIT Payments, as selected by
the Managing Member in its discretion from among items of potential
distribution, reimbursement, fees, expenses and indemnities, shall be reduced
for any Fiscal Year so that the REIT Payments, as so reduced, for or with
respect to such REIT Member shall not exceed the lesser of:



     | (i) | an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) four and nine-
tenths percent (4.9%) of the REIT Members total gross income (but excluding
the amount of any REIT Payments) for the Fiscal Year that is described in
subsections (A) through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(2) over (b) the amount of
gross income (within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(2)) derived by the
REIT Member from sources other than those described in subsections (A)
through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(2) (but not including the amount of any
REIT Payments); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) twenty-four percent (24%) of the
REIT Members total gross income (but excluding the amount of any REIT
Payments) for the Fiscal Year that is described in subsections (A) through (I)
of Code Section 856(c)(3) over (b) the amount of gross income (within the
meaning of Code Section 856(c)(3)) derived by the REIT Member from sources
other than those described in subsections (A) 

---|---|--- 
 



97 amount of any REIT Payments); _provided_ , _however_ , that REIT Payments in
excess of the amounts set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above may be made if
the Managing Member, as a condition precedent, obtains an opinion of tax
counsel that the receipt of such excess amounts should not adversely affect
the REIT Members ability to qualify as a REIT. To the extent that REIT
Payments may not be made in a Fiscal Year as a consequence of the limitations
set forth in this Section 15.11, such REIT Payments shall carry over and shall
be treated as arising in the following Fiscal Year if such carry over does
not adversely affect the REIT Members ability to qualify as a REIT;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such amounts shall not carry over for more than
five Fiscal Years, and if not paid within such five Fiscal Year period, shall
expire; and _provided_ _further_ that (i) as REIT Payments are made, such
payments shall be applied first to carry over amounts outstanding, if any, and
(ii) with respect to carry over amounts for more than one Fiscal Year, such
payments shall be applied to the earliest Fiscal Year first. The purpose of
the limitations contained in this Section 15.11 is to prevent any REIT Member
from failing to qualify as a REIT under the Code by reason of such
REIT Members share of items, including distributions, reimbursements, fees,
expenses or indemnities, receivable directly or indirectly from the Company,
and this Section 15.11 shall be interpreted and applied to effectuate such
purpose.  
---|--- 

Section 15.12 _No Partition_. No Member nor any successor-in-interest to a
Member shall have the right while this Agreement remains in effect to have any
property of the Company partitioned, or to file a complaint or institute any
proceeding at law or in equity to have such property of the Company
partitioned, and each Member, on behalf of itself and its successors and
assigns hereby waives any such right. It is the intention of the Members that
the rights of the parties hereto and their successors-in-interest to Company
property, as among themselves, shall be governed by the terms of this
Agreement, and that the rights of the Members and their respective
successors-in-interest shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions as
set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 15.13 _No Third-Party Rights Created Hereby_. Other than as set forth
in Section 7.7.I, the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the purpose
of defining the interests of the Holders, _inter_ _se_ ; and no other person,
firm or entity ( _i.e._ , a party who is not a signatory hereto or a permitted
successor to such signatory hereto) shall have any right, power, title or
interest by way of subrogation or otherwise, in and to the rights, powers,
title and provisions of this Agreement. No creditor or other third party
having dealings with the Company (other than as expressly set forth herein
with respect to Indemnitees) shall have the right to enforce the right or
obligation of any Member to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Company
or to pursue any other right or remedy hereunder or at law or in equity. None
of the rights or obligations of the Members herein set forth to make Capital
Contributions or loans to the Company shall be deemed an asset of the Company
for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may any such rights
or obligations be sold, Transferred or assigned by the Company or pledged or
encumbered by the Company to secure any Debt or other obligation of the
Company or any of the Members.

 



98 Section 15.14 _No Rights as Stockholders_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed as conferring upon the Holders of Membership Units any

100 _EXHIBIT A: EXAMPLES REGARDING ADJUSTMENT FACTOR _

 

For purposes of the following examples, it is assumed that (a) the Adjustment
Factor in effect on December 31, 2017 is 1.0 and (b) on January 1, 2018 (the
" _Company Record Date_ " for purposes of these examples), prior to the events
described in the examples, there are 100 REIT Shares issued and outstanding.

 

 _Example 1_

On the Company Record Date, CLNS Credit declares a dividend on its
outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares. The amount of the dividend is one REIT
Share paid in respect of each REIT Share owned. Pursuant to Paragraph (i) of
the definition of "Adjustment Factor," the Adjustment Factor shall be
adjusted on the Company Record Date, effective immediately after the stock
dividend is declared, as follows:

1.0 * 200/100 = 2.0

Accordingly, the Adjustment Factor after the stock dividend is declared is
2.0.

 

 _Example 2_

On the Company Record Date, CLNS Credit distributes options to purchase REIT
Shares to all holders of its REIT Shares. The amount of the distribution is
one option to acquire one REIT Share in respect of each REIT Share owned. The
strike price is $4.00 a share. The Value of a REIT Share on the Company
Record Date is $5.00 per share. Pursuant to Paragraph (ii) of the definition
of "Adjustment Factor," the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted on the Company
Record Date, effective immediately after the options are distributed, as
follows:

1.0 * (100 + 100)/(100 + [100 * $4.00/$5.00]) = 1.1111

 

Accordingly, the Adjustment Factor after the options are distributed is
1.1111. If the options expire or become no longer exercisable, then the
retroactive adjustment specified in Paragraph (ii) of the definition of
"Adjustment Factor" shall apply.

_Example 3_

 

On the Company Record Date, CLNS Credit distributes assets to all holders of
its REIT Shares. The amount of the distribution is one asset with a fair
market value (as determined by the Managing Member) of $1.00 in respect of
each REIT Share owned. It is also assumed that the assets do not relate to
assets received by the Managing Member pursuant to a pro rata distribution by
the Company. The Value of a REIT Share on the Company Record Date is $5.00 a
share. Pursuant to Paragraph (iii) of the definition of "Adjustment Factor,"
the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted on the Company Record Date, effective
immediately after the assets are distributed, as follows:

1.0 * $5.00/($5.00 - $1.00) = 1.25

 

Accordingly, the Adjustment Factor after the assets are distributed is 1.25.

majority of the Independent Directors; _provided_ that no approval of the
Board of Directors shall be required in connection with a transfer by
operation of law or pursuant to a merger, sale of all or substantially all of

4  this Agreement, or waiver of any material provision of this Agreement by the
Company, shall require the prior written approval of a majority of the
Independent Directors. The failure of any party to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of any
such provision and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to
enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

Section 4.2 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
otherwise unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by Law, shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and
effect. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

 

Section 4.3 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, this Agreement, together with the agreements and other documents and
instruments referred to herein, embodies the complete agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter

or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, that may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 4.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 4.6 _Remedies._

adequate remedy in the event that each and every one of the covenants
or agreements in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
terms, and it is therefore agreed that, in addition to, and without limiting
any other remedy or right it may have, the non-breaching party will have the
right to seek an injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equitable
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and
enforcing specifically each and every one of the terms and provisions hereof.
Each party hereto agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the
event a court determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy.

 

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at Law or in equity shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by
any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other
such right, power or remedy by such party.

made under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given if
personally delivered, electronic transmission or mailed by registered or

Sale, Assignment, Acceptance and Assumption Agreement conveying the Holdco
Units to the Trust, a copy of which is attached as _Appendix A_ hereto (such
conveyance, the " _Grant_ "). The Company or its successor in the Company

and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be
necessary or proper to carry out effectively the purposes of this Agreement,
to confirm or effectuate the transfer to the Trustees of any property intended
to be covered hereby, and to vest in the Trustees and its successors and
assigns, the estate, powers, instruments or funds in trust hereunder.

Section 2.02 _Purpose of Trust_.

 

(a) The Trust is organized for the sole purpose of liquidating the Retained
Asset and, in connection therewith, holding the Holdco Units, acting as the
managing member of Holdco and causing Holdco and any Holdco Subsidiaries to
own, hold, service and receive the proceeds of any sale of the Trust Assets
and the Holdco Assets for the ultimate purpose of liquidating the Trust Assets
and the Holdco Assets and distributing the net proceeds of the Trust Assets
and the Holdco Assets to the Beneficiaries, with no objective to continue or
engage in the conduct of a trade or business or cause Holdco or any Holdco
Subsidiary to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade or business,
except as necessary for the orderly liquidation of, and preservation or
realization of the value of, the Trust Assets and the Holdco Assets.

 

(b) In connection with the foregoing, the Trustees will (i) take such actions
as they deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Trust
and facilitate the holding, servicing, collection of principal and interest
payments received in respect of, and receipt of the proceeds of any sale of
the Trust Assets and the Holdco Assets, (ii) protect, conserve and manage the
Trust Assets and the Holdco Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof, and (iii) distribute the net proceeds of the Trust Assets and the
Holdco Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

 

(c) It is intended that, for federal, state and local income tax purposes, the
Trust shall be treated as a liquidating trust under Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-4(d) and any analogous provision of state or local law, and
the Beneficiaries shall be treated as the owners of their respective share of
the Trust pursuant to Sections 671 through 679 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and any analogous provision of state or
local law, and shall be taxed on their respective share of the Trusts taxable
income (including both ordinary income and capital gains) pursuant to Section
671 of the Code and any analogous provision of state or local law. The
Trustees shall file all tax returns required to be filed with any governmental
agency consistent with this position, including, but not limited to, any
returns required of grantor trusts pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.671-4(a).

 



5 Section 2.03 _No Reversion to the Company_. In no event shall any part of the
Trust Assets revert to or be distributed to the Company or its successor in
the Company Merger.

Section 2.04 _Payment of Trustee Liabilities_. If any Liability is asserted
against any Trustee as a result of the Grant, the Trustees may use such part
of the Trust Assets or the Holdco Assets as may be necessary in contesting any
such Liability or in payment thereof, and in no event shall the Trustees,
Beneficiaries, officers, manager, Advisor or agents of the Trust or any
subsidiary of the Trust be personally liable, nor shall resort be had to the
private property of such Persons, in the event that the Trust Assets and the
Holdco Assets are not sufficient to satisfy the Liabilities of the Trust.

Section 2.05 _Management of Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of any agreements governing the management and
operation of any Trust Subsidiary, including, without limitation,
with respect to obligations of the directors, officers, managers, partners or
members of any such entity to act in the best interests of the Trust
Subsidiary and the equity holders, partners or members of such Trust
Subsidiary, the Trustees shall take such actions with respect to the Trusts
direct or indirect interest in each Trust Subsidiary (whether in connection
with the Trusts position as direct or indirect equity owner, partner, member
or manager, or as a director, officer, employee or agent of such Trust
Subsidiary), and shall, subject to any obligations to any other equity owners,
partners or members of a Trust Subsidiary, cause each Trust Subsidiary to take
such actions, as are consistent with the purposes and provisions of the Trust
and this Agreement.

(b) The Trustees shall, to the extent not done on or prior to the Grant Date,
and to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the Trustees, amend, or
cause to be amended, the operating agreements and other governing documents of
each Trust Subsidiary and take such other action to provide that the purpose
of such entity is substantially the same as that set forth in _Section
2.02_, including no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade
or business (other than as necessary to realize or preserve the value of its
assets) and the expeditious but orderly disposition and distribution of its
assets; _provided_ that it shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of
this paragraph for any Trust Subsidiary to continue to engage in a trade or
business following such time as the Trust has sold all of its interests in
such Trust Subsidiary in furtherance of the Plan.

(c) The Trustees shall cause each Trust Subsidiary to distribute to the Trust
and to such Trust Subsidiarys other equity owners, partners or members, if
any, in accordance with the governing documents of such Trust Subsidiary, on
or before each distribution provided for in  _Section 5.06_ and _Section
5.07_ such portion of its cash as is deemed necessary by the Trustees to make
such distribution pursuant to _Section 5.06_ or _Section 5.07_.

 

(d) The Trustees may serve as partners, members, directors, officers,
employees or agents of a Trust Subsidiary.

 

Section 2.06 _Management Services Agreement_. Concurrently with the Grant, the
Trust and Holdco will enter into a management services agreement with the
Advisor to service and assist in the sale of the Retained Asset and to provide
administrative services to the Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries, on such terms
and conditions as may be approved by the Trustees.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

 

Section 3.01 _Beneficial Interests_.

 

(a) Pursuant to the Plan, immediately prior to the effective time of the
Company Merger, the Company will distribute to each record owner
of outstanding Shares one unit of Beneficial Interest (a " _Unit_ ") in the
Trust for each Share then held of record by such Stockholder. Following this
distribution, each Beneficiary shall have a pro rata undivided beneficial
interest in the Holdco Units and any other Trust Assets equal to the number
of Units held by such Beneficiary divided by the total number of Units held by
all Beneficiaries.

 

(b) The rights of Beneficiaries in, to and under the Trust Assets and the
Trust shall not be represented by any form of certificate or
other instrument, and no Beneficiary shall be entitled to such a certificate.
The Trustees shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a record of the name
and address of each Beneficiary and the aggregate number of Units held by such
Beneficiary.

 

(c) If any conflicting claims or demands are made or asserted with respect to
the ownership of any Units, or if there is any disagreement between the
transferees, assignees, heirs, representatives or legatees succeeding to all
or part of the interest of any Beneficiary resulting in adverse claims or
demands being made in connection with such Units, then, in any of such events,
the Trustees shall be entitled, at their sole election, to refuse to comply
with any such conflicting claims or demands. In so refusing, the Trustees may
elect to make no payment or distribution with respect to such Units, or to
make such payment to a court of competent jurisdiction or an escrow agent,
and in so doing, the Trustees shall not be or become liable to any of such
parties for its failure or refusal to comply with any of such conflicting
claims or demands or to take any other action with respect thereto, nor shall
the Trustees be liable for interest on any funds which it may so withhold.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 3.01(c)_,
the Trustees shall be entitled to refrain and refuse to act until either (i)
the rights of the adverse claimants have been adjudicated by a final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) all differences have been adjusted
by valid written agreement between all of such parties, and the Trustees
shall have been furnished with an executed counterpart of such agreement, or
(iii) there is furnished to the Trustees a surety bond or other security
satisfactory to the Trustees, as they shall deem appropriate, to fully
indemnify them as between all conflicting claims or demands.

Section 3.02 _Rights of Beneficiaries_. Each Beneficiary shall be entitled to
participate in the rights and benefits due to a Beneficiary hereunder
according to the Beneficiarys Beneficial Interest. Each Beneficiary shall
take and hold the same subject to all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The interest of each Beneficiary hereunder is declared, and shall
be in all respects, personal property and upon the death of an individual
Beneficiary, the Beneficiarys Beneficial Interest shall pass as personal
property to the Beneficiarys legal representative and such death shall in no
way terminate or affect the validity of this Agreement. A Beneficiary shall

 



7  have no title to, right to, possession of, management of, or control of, any
of the Trust Assets except the right to receive distributions of the net
proceeds thereof as, when, and if made as expressly provided herein. No
widower, widow, heir or devisee of any person who may be a Beneficiary shall
have any right of dower, homestead, or inheritance, or of partition, or of any
other right, statutory or otherwise, in any of the Trust Assets.

Section 3.03 _Limitations on Transfer_. THE BENEFICIAL INTEREST OF A
BENEFICIARY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OTHER THAN BY WILL, INTESTATE SUCCESSION
OR OPERATION OF LAW; _provided_ that a Beneficiary shall be allowed to assign
or transfer a Beneficial Interest held by a tax-qualified employee retirement
plan or account (including a regular IRA, a Keogh plan or a 401(k) plan) to
the plan participant or account owner, but only if and to the extent that (a)
a distribution from the plan or account is required to be made in order to
satisfy the required minimum distribution (" _RMD_ ") provisions applicable
to such plan or account, and (b) such RMD requirements cannot be satisfied by
distributing other assets from such plan or account, or from other accounts of
such account owner; and further provided, that the executor or administrator
of the estate of a Beneficiary may mortgage, pledge, grant a security interest
in, hypothecate or otherwise encumber, the Beneficial Interest held by the
estate of such Beneficiary if necessary in order to borrow money to pay
estate, succession or inheritance taxes or the expenses of administering the
estate of the Beneficiary, upon written notice to and upon written consent of
the Trustees, which consent may be withheld in the Trustees sole discretion.
Furthermore, except as may be otherwise required by law, the Beneficial
Interests of the Beneficiaries hereunder shall not be subject to attachment,
execution, sequestration or any order of a court, nor shall such interests be
subject to the contracts, debts, obligations, engagements or liabilities of
any Beneficiary. The interest of a Beneficiary shall be paid by the Trustees
to the Beneficiary free and clear of all assignments, attachments,
anticipations, levies, executions, decrees and sequestrations and shall
become the property of the Beneficiary only when actually received by such
Beneficiary.

Section 3.04 _Trustees as Beneficiary_. The Trustees, either individually or
in a representative or fiduciary capacity, may be a Beneficiary to the same
extent as if they were not the Trustees hereunder and shall have all rights of
a Beneficiary, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to
receive distributions, to the same extent as if they were not the Trustees
hereunder.

ARTICLE IV 

DURATION AND TERMINATION OF THE TRUST

 

Section 4.01 _Duration_. The existence of the Trust shall terminate upon the
earliest of (1) the liquidation and distribution of the net proceeds of all
of the Trust Assets and Holdco Assets as provided in _Section 5.07_, or (2)
the expiration of a period of three years from the Grant Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Trustees may continue the existence of the Trust beyond
the three-year term if the Trustees reasonably determine that an extension is
necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Trust.

 

Section 4.02 _Other Obligations of Trustees upon Termination_. Upon
termination of the Trust, the Trustees shall provide for the retention of the
books, records, lists of holders of Units, and files which shall have been
delivered to or created by the Trustees, the Advisor, or their

 



8  respective agents. At the Trustees discretion, all of such records and
documents may be destroyed at any time after six years following the final
distribution with respect to the Holdco Assets. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, upon the final distribution with respect to the
Holdco Assets, the Trustees shall have no further duties or obligations
hereunder; provided, that the Trustees shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and agreements as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the
termination of the Trust.

ARTICLE V

 

ADMINISTRATION OF TRUST ASSETS

 

Section 5.01 _Sale of Holdco Assets and Trust Assets_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Holdco LLC Agreement, the Trustees
shall cause Holdco and the Holdco Subsidiaries to hold and service the
Retained Asset with the objective of realizing the value of the Retained Asset
for the benefit of the members of Holdco and the Beneficiaries. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Holdco LLC Agreement,
the Trustees may, and may cause the Trust, in its capacity as managing member
of Holdco to, at such times as they deem appropriate, in their discretion,
collect, liquidate, reduce to cash, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of
all or any part of the Holdco Assets or the Trust Assets as they deem
appropriate at public auction or at private sale for cash, securities or other
property, or upon credit (either secured or unsecured as the Trustee shall
determine). The Trustees shall make appropriate efforts to dispose of the
Holdco Assets and the Trust Assets, make timely distributions and not unduly
prolong the duration of the Trust.

 

Section 5.02 _Efforts to Resolve Claims and Liabilities_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Trustees shall make appropriate efforts
to resolve any contingent or unliquidated claims and outstanding contingent
Liabilities for which the Trust or any Trust Subsidiary may be responsible,

as contemplated in the Holdco LLC Agreement and this Agreement, make timely
distributions to the members of Holdco and the Beneficiaries, and not unduly
prolong the duration of the Trust.

 

Section 5.03 _Continued Collection of Trust Assets_. All property that is
determined to be a part of the Trust Assets shall continue to be collected by
the Trustees and held as a part of the Trust. The Trustees shall hold the
Trust Assets without being obligated to provide for or pay any interest
thereon to any Beneficiary, except to the extent of such Beneficiarys share
of interest actually earned by the Trust after payment of the Trusts
liabilities and expenses as provided in _Section 5.05_.

 

Section 5.04 _Restriction on Trust Assets_. The Trust shall not receive, or
permit any Trust Subsidiary to receive, transfers of, and shall cause to be
distributed, any assets prohibited by Revenue Procedure 82-58, 1982-2 C.B. 847
(as amplified by Revenue Procedure 91-15, 1991-1 C.B. 484), as the same may be
further amended, supplemented, or modified, including, but not limited to,
any listed stocks or securities, any readily-marketable assets, any operating
assets of a going business, any unlisted stock of a single issuer that
represents 80% or more of the stock of such issuer, or any general or
limited partnership interest, it being understood that the interests in the
Trust Subsidiaries do not constitute any such assets. The Trustees shall not
retain cash in excess of a reasonable amount to meet expenses and Liabilities
of the Trust and the Trust Assets.

 



9 Section 5.05 _Payment of Expenses and Liabilities_. The Trustees shall pay
from the Trust Assets all expenses and Liabilities of the Trust and of the
Trust Assets, including, but not limited to, interest, penalties, taxes,
assessments, and public charges of any kind or nature and the costs, charges,
and expenses connected with or growing out of the execution or administration
of the Trust and such other payments and disbursements as are provided in this
Agreement or which may be determined to be a proper charge against the Trust
Assets by the Trustees.

 

Section 5.06 _Interim Distributions_. At such times as may be determined in
their sole discretion, the Trustees shall cause Holdco to distribute to the
Trust (as the holder of the Holdco Units), and upon receipt by the Trust of
such distribution, the Trustees shall distribute, or cause to be distributed,
to the Beneficiaries, in proportion to the number of Units held by
each Beneficiary on the record date for such distribution as determined by
the Trustees in their sole discretion, such cash or other property comprising
a portion the Trust Assets as the Trustees may in their sole discretion
determine may be distributed. 

Section 5.07 _Final Distribution_. If the Trustees determine that the
Liabilities and all other claims, expenses, charges, and obligations of the
Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries have been paid or discharged, and all Trust
Assets have been liquidated, the Trustees shall, as expeditiously as is
consistent with the conservation and protection of the Holdco Assets and
the Trust Assets, cause Holdco to distribute to the Trust (as the holder of
the Holdco Units) the remaining Holdco Assets, if any, and upon receipt by the
Trust of such distribution, the Trustees shall distribute the amounts so
received to the Beneficiaries in proportion to the number of Units held by
each Beneficiary.

Section 5.08 _Reports to Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Grant Date, the Trustees will mail to
each Beneficiary a notice indicating how many Units such person beneficially
owns and the Trustees addresses and other contact information.

(b) As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Trust on
a timeline as though the Trust were a non-accelerated filer of reports under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust shall file an annual report
under the cover of Form 10-K with the Commission showing the assets
and liabilities of the Trust at the end of the applicable calendar year and
the receipts and disbursements of the Trust for such period covered by the
report. The annual report also will describe the changes in the assets of the
Trust and the actions taken by the Trustees during such period covered by the
report. The financial statements contained within such annual report need not
be audited but will be prepared on a liquidation basis in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The Trust also will file interim
reports on Form 8-K with the Commission whenever an event occurs for which a
Form 8-K is required to be filed for the Trust or whenever, in the opinion of
the Trustees, in their discretion, any other material event relating to the
Trust or its assets has occurred.

 



10 (c) The tax year and the fiscal year of the Trust shall end on December 31 of
each year. 

Section 5.09 _Federal Income Tax Information_. As soon as practicable after
the close of each tax year, the Trustees shall mail to each Person who was a
Beneficiary during such year, a statement showing, on a per Unit basis, the
information necessary to enable a Beneficiary to determine its taxable income
(if any) from the Trust as determined for federal income tax purposes. In
addition, after receipt of a request in good faith, the Trustees shall furnish
to any Person who has been a Beneficiary at any time during the preceding
year, at the expense of such Person and at no cost to the Trust, a statement
containing such further tax information as is reasonably available to the
Trustees and reasonably requested by such Person.

Section 5.10 _Books and Records_. The Trustees shall maintain in respect of
the Trust and the holders of Units books and records relating to the Trust
Assets and the income and liabilities of the Trust in such detail and for such
period of time as may be necessary to enable it to make full and proper
accounting in respect thereof in accordance with this _Article V_ and to
comply with applicable law. Such books and records shall be maintained on a
basis or bases of accounting necessary to facilitate compliance with the tax
reporting requirements of the Trust and the reporting obligations of the
Trustees under _Section 5.08_. Nothing in this Agreement requires the
Trustees to file any accounting or seek approval of any court with respect to
the administration of the Trust or as a condition for making any payment or
distribution out of the Trust Assets. Beneficiaries and their agents shall be
entitled, upon 30 days prior written notice delivered to the Trustees,
to inspect and copy (at their own expense) during normal business hours the
following (and only the following) documents, solely to the extent that such
documents are not publicly available on the website of the Commission: (i)
this Agreement and all amendments hereto; (ii) minutes of the proceedings (if
any) of the Beneficiaries; (iii) an annual statement of affairs (which may be
the annual report contemplated by _Section 5.08(a)_); and (iv) any voting
trust agreements on file at the Trusts principal office; _provided_ that, if
so requested, such Beneficiaries shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement satisfactory in form and substance to the Trustees

 

Section 5.11 _Appointment of Agents, etc._

 

(a) The Trustees shall be responsible for the general policies of the Trust
and for the general supervision of the activities of the Trust and Trust
Subsidiaries conducted by all agents, officers, employees, advisors or
managers of the Trust or any of the Trust Subsidiaries. The Trustees shall
have the power to appoint, employ or contract with any Person or Persons as
the Trustees may deem necessary or proper for the transaction of all or any
portion of the activities of the Trust, including appointment of officers of
the Trust and the Trust Subsidiaries and the retention of the Advisor under a
management services agreement, as contemplated by _Section 2.06_. For
purposes of this Agreement, the Advisor shall be deemed to be an agent of the
Trust.

(b) The Trustees shall have the power to determine the terms and compensation
of any Person with whom it may contract pursuant to _Section 5.11(a)_.

 



11 (c) The Trustees shall not be required to administer the Trust as their sole
and exclusive function and the Trustees may have other business interests and
may engage in other activities similar or in addition to those relating to the
Trust, including in competitive business interests, including, without
limitation, the rendering of advice or services of any kind to investors or
any other Persons and the management of other investments, subject to the
Trustees obligations under this Agreement and applicable law.

 

ARTICLE VI

BOARD OF TRUSTEES

Section 6.01 _Board of Trustees_. The Trust and its affairs shall be governed,
managed and administered by a Board of Trustees. References in this Agreement
to the "Trustees" shall constitute references to the Board of Trustees acting
as described in this _Article VI_ , unless the context otherwise requires.

 

Section 6.02 _Number and Qualification of Trustees_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.03_ relating to the period
pending the appointment of a successor Trustee, there shall be three Trustees
of this Trust comprising the Board of Trustees, who shall be citizens and
residents of, or a corporation or other entity which is incorporated or formed
under the laws of, a state of the United States and, if a corporation, it
shall be authorized to act as a corporate fiduciary under the laws of the
State of Maryland or such other jurisdiction as shall be determined by the
Trustee in its sole discretion. The number of Trustees may be increased or
decreased from time to time by the Trustees, provided that there shall never
be fewer than one Trustee.

(b) If a corporate Trustee shall ever change its name, or shall reorganize or
reincorporate, or shall merge with or into or consolidate with any other bank
or trust company, such corporate trustee shall be deemed to be a continuing
entity and shall continue to act as a trustee hereunder with the
same liabilities, duties, powers, titles, discretions, and privileges as are
herein specified for a Trustee.

(c) A majority of the Trustees shall be Independent Trustees; _provided_
that, if one or more Independent Trustees shall resign or be removed, and
pending the filling of the vacancy or vacancies created by such resignation or
removal less than a majority of the Trustees are Independent Trustees, the
failure of a majority of the Trustees to be Independent Trustees shall not
affect the validity of any action taken by the Trustees.

 

Section 6.03 _Resignation and Removal_. Any Trustee may resign and be
discharged from the Trust by giving written notice to the other Trustees.
Such resignation shall become effective on the date specified in such notice.
Any Trustee may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by
Beneficiaries holding in the aggregate more than two-thirds of the total Units
held by all Beneficiaries at a meeting of the Beneficiaries duly called for
such purpose.

Section 6.04 _Appointment of Successor_. If at any time a Trustee resigns or
is removed, dies, becomes mentally incompetent or physically incapable of
performing such Trustees responsibilities hereunder (as determined by the
other Trustees), or is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, unless the remaining
Trustees (if any) shall decrease the number of Trustees

 



12  comprising the Board of Trustees pursuant to _Section 6.02_ hereof, or in
the event the number of Trustees comprising the Board of Trustees shall be
increased pursuant to  _Section 6.02_ hereof, a vacancy shall be deemed to
exist and a successor shall be appointed by action of a majority of the
remaining Trustees (if any). If (i) such a vacancy is not filled by the
remaining Trustees within ninety (90) days, and the remaining Trustees, if
any, have notified the Beneficiaries of their inability to fill such vacancy
or (ii) there is no remaining Trustee, then the Beneficiaries may, pursuant to
_Article XII_ hereof, call a meeting to appoint a successor Trustee or
successor Trustees. At such meeting, holders of a majority of the outstanding
Units shall constitute a quorum and a successor Trustee or successor Trustees
shall be appointed by Beneficiaries holding Units representing a majority of
the total Units present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, with each Unit
being entitled to be voted with respect to each vacancy to be filled at such
meeting. Pending the appointment of a successor Trustee, the remaining
Trustee or Trustees then serving may continue to take all actions that may be
taken by the Trustees hereunder.

 

Section 6.05 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee_. Any successor
Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder and shall file one counterpart with the books and
records of the Trust and, in case of a resignation, deliver one counterpart to
the resigning Trustee. Thereupon such successor Trustee shall, without any
further act, become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
trusts, and duties of its predecessor in the Trust hereunder with like effect
as if originally named therein.

 

Section 6.06 _Required Approval for Action by Trustees_. At any time there is
more than one Trustee, all action required or permitted to be taken by the
Trustees, in their capacity as Trustees, shall be taken by approval, consent,
vote or resolution, including by written consent, authorized by at least a
majority of all of the Trustees.

 

Section 6.07 _Compensation; Expense Reimbursement_. The Independent Trustees
shall be entitled to receive compensation for their services as Trustees
[comparable to/not in excess of] that paid by the Company to its independent
directors prior to the Company Merger, consisting of reasonable meeting fees
or quarterly or annual retainer fees or a combination of such fees,
as determined by the Trustees. Each Trustee shall be reimbursed from the
Trust Assets or the Holdco Assets for all expenses reasonably incurred, and
appropriately documented, by such Trustee in the performance of that Trustees
duties in accordance with this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.01 _Limitations on Trustees_. The Trustees shall not cause or permit
the Trust, and shall not cause or permit any Trust Subsidiary, to enter into
or engage in any trade or business except as necessary to carry out the
purposes of the Trust. In no event shall the Trustees take any action which
would jeopardize the status of the Trust as a "liquidating trust" for
federal, state or local income tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d) and any analogous provision of state or local
law. The Trustees shall not invest any of the cash held as Trust Assets in

with the Trusts status as a liquidating trust for tax purposes.

 

Section 7.02 _Specific Powers of Trustees_. Subject to the provisions of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Trustees shall have the following
specific powers in addition to any and all powers conferred upon them by any

Maryland; provided that the enumeration of the following powers shall not be
considered in any way to limit or control the power of the Trustees to act as
specifically authorized by any other Section or provision of this Agreement

to conserve and protect the Trust Assets and the Holdco Assets or to confer
on the Beneficiaries the benefits intended to be conferred upon them by this

or the Holdco Assets for services in as many capacities as such Person may be
so elected, appointed, engaged, employed or retained, to prescribe the titles,
powers and duties, terms of service and other terms and conditions of the

disposition thereof or distribution thereof to the Beneficiaries;

(f) to institute, defend, settle or otherwise resolve actions, judgments or
claims for declaratory relief or other actions, judgments or claims and to

may extend beyond the terms of the Trust;

(i) in the event any of the property which is or may become a part of the
Trust Assets or the Holdco Assets is situated in any state or other
jurisdiction in which the Trustees are not qualified to act as Trustees, to
nominate and appoint an individual or corporate trustee qualified to act in
such state or other jurisdiction in connection with the property situated in
that state or other jurisdiction as a trustee of such property and require
from such trustee such security, if any, as may be designated by the Trustees,
which, in the sole discretion of the Trustees may be paid out of the
Trust Assets or the Holdco Assets. The trustee so appointed shall have all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties and shall be subject to the
conditions and limitations of the Trust, except as limited by the Trustees and
except where the same may be modified by the laws of such state or other
jurisdiction (in which case, the laws of the state or other jurisdiction in
which such trustee is acting shall prevail to the extent necessary). Such
trustee shall be answerable to the Trustees herein appointed for all monies,
assets and other property which may be received by it in connection with the
administration of such property. The Trustees hereunder may remove such
trustee, with or without cause, and appoint a successor trustee at any time
by the execution by the Trustees of a written instrument declaring such
trustee removed from office, and specifying the effective date of removal;

 

(j) to cause any investments of any part of the Trust Assets or the Holdco
Assets to be registered and held in its name or in the names of a nominee or
nominees without increase or decrease of liability with respect thereto;

(k) to (i) terminate and dissolve any entities owned by the Trust or any
Trust Subsidiary and (ii) form any new entities to be owned by the Trust or

1982-2 C.B. 847 (as amplified by Revenue Procedure 91-15, 1991-1 C.B. 484), as
the same may be further amended, supplemented, or modified;

 



15 (l) to perform any act authorized, permitted, or required under any
instrument, contract, agreement, right, obligation, or cause of action

otherwise, unless such act would require the consent of the Beneficiaries in
accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement; and

(m) adopt Bylaws not inconsistent with this Agreement providing for the
conduct of the business of the Trust and to amend and repeal them.

Section 7.03 _Conflicts of Interest_.

(a) Whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between any Trustee or
any of such Trustees Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust, on the
other hand (a " _Conflict of Interest_ "), any decisions or actions taken by
the Trustees with respect to such Conflict of Interest (i) shall be taken only
by the Independent Trustees and (ii) shall not include the conflicted
Trustee. Any agreements or arrangements concerning a Conflict of Interest
shall be on terms no less favorable to the Trust than those available to the
Trust in similar agreements or arrangements with unaffiliated third parties.

(b) Whenever a Conflict of Interest arises or whenever this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated herein provides that the Trustees shall act in a
manner that is, or provide terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust,
any Beneficiaries or any other Person, the Trustees making such decision or
taking such action shall resolve such Conflict of Interest, take such action
or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each
party (including their own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction
or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any
customary or accepted industry practices and any applicable generally accepted
accounting practices or principles.

(c) Any Trustee, officer, employee, independent contractor or agent of the
Trust, including the Advisor, may own, hold and dispose of Units for its
individual account, and may exercise all rights thereof and thereunder to the
same extent and in the same manner as if it were not a Trustee, officer,
employee, independent contractor or agent of the Trust. Any Trustee, officer,
employee, independent contractor or agent of the Trust, including the Advisor,
may, in its personal capacity or in the capacity of trustee, manager,
officer, director, shareholder, partner, member, advisor, employee of any
Person or otherwise, have business interests and holdings similar to or in
addition to those relating to the Trust, including business interests and
holdings that are competitive with the Trust. Any Trustee, officer, employee,
independent contractor or agent of the Trust, including the Advisor, may be a
trustee, manager, officer, director, shareholder, partner, member, advisor,
employee or independent contractor of, or otherwise have a direct or indirect
interest in, any Person who may be engaged to render advice or services to the
Trust, and may receive compensation from such Person as well as compensation
as Trustee, employee, independent contractor or agent, including as manager
or Advisor, or otherwise hereunder so long as such interest is disclosed to
the Trustees. None of these activities in and of themselves shall be deemed to
conflict with its duties as Trustee, officer, employee, independent
contractor or agent of the Trust, including as Advisor. The doctrine of
corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to the
Trustees or officers or other agents of the Trust or the Trust Subsidiaries,
including the Advisor. No Trustee or officer who acquires knowledge of a

 



16  potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an
opportunity for the Trust shall have any duty to communicate or offer such
opportunity to the Trust, and such Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust
or to the Beneficiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of
the fact that such Trustee pursues or acquires for, or directs such
opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or
information to the Trust. Neither the Trust nor any Beneficiary shall have any
rights or obligations by virtue of this Agreement or the trust relationship
created hereby in or to such independent ventures or the income or profits
or losses derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such ventures, even if
competitive with the activities of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or
improper. Any Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other
transaction with the Beneficiaries or any Affiliate of the Trust or the
Beneficiaries, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on
any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the
Trust or the Beneficiaries or their Affiliates.

to do hereunder, or for any mistake of fact or law, or for any error of
judgment, or for the misconduct of any employee, agent, representative or

Trustees in good faith and in the reliance on, or in accordance with, such
advice or opinion.

(b) Persons dealing with the Trustees shall look only to the Trust Assets to
satisfy any liability incurred by the Trustees to such Person in carrying out
the terms of the Trust, and the Trustees shall have no personal or individual
obligation to satisfy any such liability.

 

(c) As far as reasonably practicable, the Trustees shall cause any written
instrument creating an obligation of the Trust to include a reference to this
Agreement and to provide that neither the Beneficiaries, the Trustees nor
their agents shall be liable thereunder, and that the other parties to such
instrument shall look solely to the Trust Assets for the payment of any
claim thereunder or the performance thereof; _provided_ that the omission of
such provision from any such instrument shall not render the Beneficiaries,
the Trustees or their agents liable, nor shall the Trustees be liable to
anyone for such omission.

Section 8.03 _Limitation on Liability to Third Persons_. No Beneficiary shall
be subject to any personal liability whatsoever, in tort, contract, or
otherwise, to any Person in connection with the Trust Assets, the Holdco
Assets or the affairs of the Trust. To the maximum extent that Maryland law in
effect from time to time permits limitation of the liability of trustees or
officers of a Maryland statutory trust, no present or former Trustee or
officer or other agent of the Trust or of any Trust Subsidiary, including the
Advisor, shall be subject to any personal liability whatsoever in tort,
contract or otherwise, to the Trust, any Beneficiary or any other Person. All
Persons shall look solely to the Trust Assets for satisfaction of claims of
any nature arising in connection with the affairs of the Trust. The Trustees
shall, at all times, at the expense of the Trust, maintain insurance for the
protection of the Trust Assets, its Beneficiaries, the Trustees and agents in
such amount as the Trustees shall deem adequate, in the exercise of their
discretion, to cover all foreseeable liability to the extent available at
reasonable rates.

 



18 Section 8.04 _Recitals_. Any written instrument creating an obligation of the
Trust shall be conclusively taken to have been executed or done by a Trustee
or agent of the Trust only in its capacity as Trustee under this Agreement, or
in its capacity as an agent of the Trust.

 

Section 8.05 _Indemnification_. The Trustees and each Person appointed or
employed by the Trustees pursuant to  _Section 5.11_, including the Advisor,
and the directors, officers, employees, managers and agents of each Trustee
(each such person an " _Indemnified Person_ " and collectively the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "), shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
indemnified out of the Trust Assets and the Holdco Assets against all claims,
actions, liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of
judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and counsel fees,
reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with the defense
or disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding by the Trust, the
Advisor or any other Person, whether civil or criminal, in which
the Indemnified Person may be involved or with which the Indemnified Person
may be threatened: (i) in the case of a Trustee or a Person appointed by the
Trustees pursuant to _Section 5.11_, including the Advisor, while in office
or thereafter, by reason of his being or having been such a Trustee, Advisor,
employee or agent including, without limitation, in connection with or arising
out of any action, suit or other proceeding based on any alleged breach of
duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement, omission or act of
any such Trustee, Advisor, or Person in such capacity: and (ii) in the case of
any director, officer, employee, manager or agent of any such Person, by
reason of any such Person exercising or failing to exercise any right or
power hereunder. The rights accruing to any Indemnified Person under these
provisions shall not exclude any other right to which the Indemnified Person
may be lawfully entitled; _provided_ that no Indemnified Person may satisfy
any right of indemnity or reimbursement granted herein, or to which the
Indemnified Person may be otherwise entitled, except out of the Trust Assets
and the Holdco Assets, and no Beneficiary shall be personally liable to any
person with respect to any claim for indemnity or reimbursement or otherwise.
The Trustees may make advance payments in connection with indemnification
under this _Section 8.05_, provided that the Indemnified Person shall have
given a written undertaking to repay any amount advanced to the Indemnified
Person and to reimburse the Trust in the event that it is subsequently
determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to such
indemnification. The Trustees shall cause the Trust to purchase such
insurance as they believe, in the exercise of their discretion, adequately
insures that each Indemnified Person shall be indemnified against any such
claims, actions, liabilities and expenses pursuant to this  _Section 8.05_.
Nothing contained herein shall restrict the right of the Trustees to indemnify
or reimburse such Indemnified Person in any proper case, even though not
specifically provided for herein, nor shall anything contained
herein restrict the right of any such Indemnified Person to contribution
under applicable law.

Section 8.06 _Reliance on Statements by Trustees_. Any Person dealing with
the Trustees shall be fully protected in relying upon the Trustees
certificate, signed by any one or more of the Trustees, with respect to the
authority that one or more Trustees, or any officer or agent of the Trust,
has to take any action with respect to the Trust. Any Person dealing with the
Trustees shall be fully protected in relying upon the Trustees certificate
setting forth the facts concerning any action taken by the Trustees
pursuant to this Agreement.

it is provided that the Beneficiaries may take any action (including the
making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent, or waiver,
the removal of a Trustee, the appointment of a successor Trustee, or the
taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any
such action such Beneficiaries have joined therein may be evidenced: (i) by
any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by the

favor thereof at any meeting of Beneficiaries duly called and held in
accordance with the provisions of _Article X_.

action or proceeding at law or in equity against any party other than the
Trustees upon or under or with respect to the Trust Assets or the Holdco
Assets or the agreements relating to or forming part of the Trust Assets
or the Holdco Assets, and the Beneficiaries (by their acceptance of any
distribution made to them pursuant to this Agreement) waive any such right.

 

Section 9.03 _Requirement of Undertaking_. The Trustees may request any court
to require, and any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit
against the Trustees for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them as
Trustees, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to
pay the costs of such suit, and such court may in its discretion assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party
litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions
of this _Section 9.03_ shall not apply to any suit by the Trustees.

a meeting of the Beneficiaries to be held at such time and at such place as
the Trustees shall determine. Written notice of any meeting of the
Beneficiaries shall be given by the Trustees (except as provided in _Section
10.03_), which written notice shall set forth the time and place of
such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such
meeting, and shall be mailed not more than 60 nor less than 10 days before
such meeting is to be held to all of the Beneficiaries of record not more than
60 days before the date of such meeting. The notice shall be directed to the
Beneficiaries at their respective addresses as they appear in the records of
the Trust.

 



20 Section 10.03 _Meeting Called on Request of Beneficiaries_. Within 30 days

of at least 25% of the total Units held by all Beneficiaries to call a meeting

and purposes as though a quorum had been present. Except to the extent a
different percentage is specified in this Agreement for a particular matter or

as they shall deem appropriate, provided that such rules shall, to the extent
practicable, not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

liability of the Trustees hereunder without the written consent of the

state, or local income tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-4(d) and any analogous provision of state or local law or

Trustees herein; (ii) to facilitate the transferability by Beneficiaries of
Trust Units, subject to the ability of the liquidating trust to remain
eligible for relief from the registration and reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act, (iii) to comply with applicable laws, including tax laws or to
satisfy any requirements, conditions, guidelines or opinions contained in any
opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of the Commission, the

state or local law, if the Trustees deem it to be in the best interests of the
Beneficiaries as a whole, or (vi) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or
supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other
provision herein, or to add any other provision with respect to matters or
questions arising under this Agreement which will not be inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.03 _Notice and Effect of Amendment_. Upon the execution of any such
declaration of amendment by the Trustees, this Agreement shall be deemed to
be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights,
limitations of rights, obligations, duties, and immunities of the Trustees and
the Beneficiaries under this Agreement shall thereafter be determined,

_Plan_ ") that provides that, prior to consummation of such merger, the
Assignor will transfer its indirect ownership interests in such assets to a

WHEREAS, consistent with the Plan, Assignor now desires to assign, transfer,
and convey to Assignee all right, title, interest in and to the Holdco Units,
to be held and administered by Assignee in accordance with the terms and
