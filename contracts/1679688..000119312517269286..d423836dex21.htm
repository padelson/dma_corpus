Secretary. The Secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting (including the Corporation&#146;s proxy materials). The Secretary shall not be required to call a
special meeting upon stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required by the foregoing, the Secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the preparation and mailing or
delivery of any notice of the meeting. The Board of Directors may revoke the notice for any Stockholder Requested Meeting in the event that the requesting stockholders fail to comply with this paragraph (2)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;3(b). </P>

not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day; and <I>provided further</I> that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder-Requested Meeting within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the
Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In fixing a date for Stockholder Requested Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant, including, without
limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for the meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting. In the case of any
Stockholder-Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Delivery Date shall be

Secretary: (i)&nbsp;if the notice of meeting has not already been delivered, the Secretary shall refrain from delivering the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked such requests written notice of any
revocation of a request for a special meeting on the matter, or (ii)&nbsp;if the notice of meeting has been delivered and if the Secretary first sends to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked requests for a special meeting on the matter

electronic transmission or by any other means permitted by Maryland law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder&#146;s address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. If transmitted electronically, such notice shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an electronic transmission to any address or number of the stockholder at which
the stockholder receives electronic transmissions. The Corporation may give a single notice to all stockholders who share an address, which single notice shall be effective as to any stockholder at such address, unless a stockholder at such address
objects to receiving such single notice or revokes a prior consent to receiving such single notice. Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting

business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the
discretion of the chairman of the meeting and without any action by the stockholders, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a)&nbsp;restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the
meeting; (b)&nbsp;limiting attendance or participation at the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized proxies and such other individuals as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (c)&nbsp;limiting the time

all the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present for which (a)&nbsp;the Secretary receives notice that a stockholder has nominated an individual for election as a director in compliance with the
requirements of advance notice of stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article II, Section&nbsp;11 of these Bylaws, and (b)&nbsp;such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the close of business on the tenth (10<SUP

number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Each share of stock entitles the holder thereof to vote for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the holder of such share of stock is entitled to vote. A
majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter that may properly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast or entitled
to be cast is required by statute or by the Charter. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by the Charter, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a
meeting of stockholders. Voting on any question or in any election may be <I>viva voce</I> unless the chairman of the meeting shall order that voting be by ballot or otherwise. </P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;first-in,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-out&#148;</FONT> basis with respect to LTIP Units issued on different dates and (ii)&nbsp;on an equal basis with respect to LTIP Units issued on the same
date (i.e., Liquidating Gains shall be allocated first to the LTIP Units that were issued on the earliest date, and then with respect to such LTIP Units, equally among such LTIP Units). For this purpose, &#147;Liquidating Gains&#148; means net
capital gains realized in connection with the actual or hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, including net capital gain realized in connection with an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of Company assets under
Code Section&nbsp;704(b). &#147;Liquidating Losses&#148; means any net capital loss realized in connection with any such event. The &#147;<U>Economic Capital Account Balances</U>&#148; of the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital Account
balances to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, plus the amount of their allocable share of any Member Minimum Gain or Company Minimum Gain attributable to such LTIP Units. Similarly, the &#147;<U>Membership Common Unit
Economic Balance</U>&#148; shall mean (i)&nbsp;the Capital Account balance of the Managing Member, plus the amount of the Managing Member&#146;s share of any Member Minimum Gain or Company Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to
the Managing Member&#146;s ownership of Membership Common Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this Section&nbsp;6.3.E (including any expenses of
the Company reimbursed to the Managing Member pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.4.B), divided by (ii)&nbsp;the number of the Managing Member&#146;s Membership Common Units. The parties agree that the intent of this Section&nbsp;6.3.E is to make the Capital
Account balance associated with each LTIP Unit to be economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated with the Managing Member&#146;s Membership Common Units (on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-Membership</FONT> Common
Unit/LTIP Unit basis). The Managing Member shall be permitted to interpret this Section&nbsp;6.3.E or to amend this Agreement to the extent necessary and consistent with this intention. </P>
