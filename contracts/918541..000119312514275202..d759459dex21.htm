(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Husch Blackwell LLP, 4801 Main Street, Kansas City, MO 64112, at

Time, (a) the articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended, shall be

the provisions thereof and applicable Law and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof

Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
of and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 2.07 Conversion of Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any holder of any of the Shares:

 

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares described in Section 2.07(b) and (c) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Closing
Date Per Share Merger Consideration, in cash,

 



18  without interest, together with any Final Merger Consideration which may be
payable in respect of such Share pursuant to Section 2.10 and Article VIII of
this Agreement and any portion of the China Joint Venture Dividend payable in
respect of such Share pursuant to Section 5.17, in each case upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, on the Closing Date, the Shares held by Kennedy shall be
converted, in the aggregate, into the right to receive (i) the number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
($25,000,000) divided by the Agreed Stock Value of Buyer Common Stock (the "
_Kennedy Shares_ "), less the Escrow Amount, (ii) cash in an amount equal to
the aggregate Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration payable to Kennedy
less TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($25,000,000), and (iii) any Final Merger
Consideration which may be payable in respect of the Shares held by Kennedy
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, Section 2.10 and Article VIII of this
Agreement and any portion of the China Joint Venture Dividend payable in
respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 5.17. If at any time after the date
of this Agreement any change in the number of outstanding shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall occur as a result of any stock split (including a
reverse stock split), a stock dividend, combination of shares,
reclassification of outstanding shares, recapitalization or similar
transaction, then the number of Kennedy Shares and the Agreed Stock Value
shall be adjusted to reflect such change, including by adjustment to the
Escrow Amount and the Escrow Fund.

(b) Each Share that is owned by Buyer and Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor;

 

(c) Each Share that is held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the
Company or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor; and

 

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.08 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.07(b) and 2.07(c)) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who (a) has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented to it in writing, and (b) has properly demanded the appraisal of
such Shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with,
Michigan Law (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive a portion of the Final Merger
Consideration unless and until such holder effectively withdraws or loses such
holders right to appraisal and payment under Michigan Law. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist and the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted them under Michigan Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any
time, any such holder effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal under Michigan Law, such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed no longer
to be Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if each such Dissenting Share
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
portion of the Final Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled,
without interest, and any portion of the 

 



19  China Joint Venture Dividend to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 5.17, and such holder shall have all of the other rights of a
shareholder set forth hereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall give Buyer (a) prompt notice of any written demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, written withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to Michigan Law and received by the Company
relating to the Shareholders rights to appraisal with respect to the Merger;
and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any exercise of such appraisal rights under Michigan
Law. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair
value for capital stock of the Company or offer to settle or settle any such
demands, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned in the case of any payment
made prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.09 Payment and Calculation of Initial Merger Consideration.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered:

 

(i) to each Shareholder who has complied with Section 2.09(c), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
in writing by the Company or as set forth in such Shareholders Letter of
Transmittal (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date), an amount equal to the portion of the Closing
Date Merger Consideration to which each such Shareholder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.07(a); _provided_ , that Kennedys portion of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)(i) shall only
be the cash portion of such amount;

(ii) to an account designated in writing by the Company and agreed to by
Buyer, the remaining Closing Date Merger Consideration for Shareholders who
have not complied with Section 2.09(c);

(iii) to Kennedy, stock certificates representing the Kennedy Shares less the
Escrow Amount;

(iv) to the Escrow Agent, stock certificates or book-entry transfer
representing the Escrow Amount, for deposit into the escrow established
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

(v) to the payees thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated in writing by such payees (such designation
to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), an
amount equal to the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses;

(vi) to the Shareholder Representatives, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by or on
behalf of the Shareholder Representatives (such designation to be made at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), the Shareholder
Representatives Holdback; and

 

(vii) to the payees thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to the account or accounts designated in writing by such payees (such
designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date), the Payoff Amount.

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide to Buyer a statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Companys good faith

 



20  estimate of (i) the Company Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses_ "), (ii) the Closing Date Cash (the " _Estimated
Closing Date Cash_ "), (iii) the Assumed Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Assumed Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the Closing Working Capital Amount (the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount_ "), (v) the resulting Working
Capital Adjustment (the " _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_ "), and (vi)
the resulting Initial Merger Consideration, on an aggregate and per
shareholder basis along with reasonable detail and documentation supporting
such calculations. For illustrative purposes only, a calculation of the
Initial Merger Consideration as if the Closing Date were June 30, 2014, is
attached hereto as _Exhibit I_.

 

(c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide to the Company, and the Company shall provide to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that represent outstanding Shares (the
" _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares may be converted into the right to
receive the consideration described in Section 2.07(a), a letter of
transmittal and release in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") (i) requiring, among other things, each Shareholder
to (x) release all claims against the Company arising on or prior to the
Effective Time (other than claims or rights such Shareholder has, or which the
Shareholder Representatives may exercise on such Shareholders behalf,
pursuant to this Agreement, and other than claims or rights such Shareholder
has in its capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or a
Subsidiary) and (y) acknowledge and agree to the authority of the Shareholder
Representatives, and (ii) providing instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation at or after the Closing to Buyer or such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Buyer (the " _Payment Agent_ "),
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (on the Closing
Date if such Certificate and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
are delivered to Buyer by the Payment Agent or Shareholder at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or within two (2) Business Days of
receipt of such Certificate and duly executed Letter of Transmittal if such
Certificate and Letter of Transmittal are delivered to Buyer by the Payment
Agent or Shareholder at any other time), the portion of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration attributable to the Shares represented by such
Certificate, as set forth in Section 2.07(a), without interest, and such
Certificate shall, upon such surrender, be cancelled. If payment in respect of
any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any
related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction
of Buyer that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.09(c), any Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Shares described in Sections 2.07(b) and (c) and any Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the portion of the Final Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest, as contemplated
herein and any portion of the China Joint Venture Dividend payable in respect
of such Share pursuant to Section 5.17.

 



21 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, a Certificate (other than representing Shares described in
Sections 2.07(b) and (c)) is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.09.

(e) All Final Merger Consideration paid upon conversion of the Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II, all Buyer Common Stock deposited
with the Escrow Agent and all cash deposited with the Shareholder
Representatives (with respect to the Shareholder Representatives Holdback)
pursuant to this Section 2.09, and all amounts paid pursuant to Section 5.17
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares represented
thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of the Final Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.09(c) for Shares
represented thereby, together with any portion of the China Joint Venture
Dividend payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 5.17.

 

(g) Following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look to Buyer only as a general
creditor thereof with respect to any portion of the Final Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without interest, and any
portion of the China Joint Venture Dividend payable in respect of
such Certificates pursuant to Section 5.17. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.09, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither
Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 2.10 Closing Date Merger Consideration Adjustment.

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Shareholder Representatives a statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ ") of (i) the Company Transaction Expenses, (ii) the Closing Date
Cash, (iii) the Assumed Indebtedness, (iv) the Closing Working Capital Amount
and (v) the resulting Working Capital Adjustment. Buyer shall not amend or
modify the Post-Closing Statement following its delivery to the Shareholder
Representatives, except to the extent the Shareholder Representatives consent
to such amendment or modification. Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives
acknowledge that no adjustments shall be made to the Target Working Capital
Amount.

(b) If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement, the Shareholder Representatives have not provided Buyer with
written notice of objection to the Post-Closing Statement (that shall state
the basis of the Shareholder Representatives objection) (a " _Notice of
Objection_ "), then the Post-Closing Statement shall be binding and conclusive
on Buyer, the Shareholder Representatives, and the Shareholders at 11:59 p.m.
Michigan time on such thirtieth (30th) day.

 



22 (c) If the Shareholder Representatives deliver to Buyer a Notice of Objection
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, then,
during the fifteen (15)-day period following receipt of such Notice of
Objection (or such longer period as the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer
may agree), the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the matters specified in such Notice of Objection, and the Post-Closing
Statement shall be binding and conclusive on Buyer, the Shareholder
Representatives and the Shareholders on the date of such resolution.

(d) If Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives fail to resolve the issues
outstanding with respect to the Post-Closing Statement within fifteen (15)
days (or such longer period as the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer may
agree) of delivery of a Notice of Objection, either the Shareholder
Representatives or Buyer shall have the right to submit, within thirty (30)
days of the delivery of the Notice of Objection (or within fifteen (15) days
of the expiration of any longer period as to which the
Shareholder Representatives and Buyer may agree, as contemplated above), the
Post-Closing Statement to a nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants with a nationwide audit and accounting practice
as Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives may agree in writing (the "
_Independent Accountants_ "), so that such Independent Accountants can
determine the matters that remain in dispute on the Post-Closing Statement.

 

(e) If the Post-Closing Statement is submitted to the Independent Accountants,
(i) the Independent Accountants decision shall be based solely on written
submissions by the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer and their respective
Representatives and the terms of this Agreement and not by independent review;
(ii) the Independent Accountants may not assign a value greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either party; (iii) the Shareholder
Representatives and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountants to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to the Independent Accountants within thirty (30) days of receipt of
such submission, and such written decision shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties; and (iv) the fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountants incurred pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be borne
pro rata as between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholder
Representatives, on the other hand (from the Shareholder Representatives
Holdback or pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, as applicable), in
proportion to the final allocation made by such Independent Accountants of the
disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by the
Stockholder Representatives and Buyer, such that the prevailing party pays
the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if Buyer
claims that the appropriate adjustments are, in the aggregate, $1,000 greater
than the amount determined by the Shareholder Representatives and if the
Independent Accountants ultimately resolve the dispute by awarding to Buyer an
aggregate of $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses
of the Independent Accountants will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to
the Shareholder Representatives and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer.

 



23 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_
" means the Company Transaction Expenses, " _Final Closing Date Cash_ " means
the Closing Date Cash, " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " means the Assumed
Indebtedness, and " _Final Closing Working Capital Amount_ " means the
Closing Working Capital Amount, in each case as finally agreed or determined
in accordance with this Section 2.10. Upon such final agreement or
determination, the Initial Merger Consideration shall be recalculated as
follows: (i) increased by the sum of (1) the amount, if any, that the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses exceeds the Final Company Transaction
Expenses, plus (2) the amount, if any, that the Final Closing Date Cash
exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Cash, plus (3) the amount, if any, that
the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness exceeds the Final Assumed Indebtedness,
plus (4) the amount, if any, that the Final Closing Working Capital Amount
exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount; and (ii) decreased by
the sum of (1) the amount, if any, that the Final Company Transaction Expenses
exceeds the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, plus (2) the amount, if
any, that the Estimated Closing Date Cash exceeds the Final Closing Date
Cash, plus (3) the amount, if any, that the Final Assumed Indebtedness exceeds
the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness, plus (4) the amount, if any, that the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount exceeds the Final Closing Working
Capital Amount (such recalculated amount, the " _Final Merger Consideration_
").

 

 __(g) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Initial Merger
Consideration, Kennedy shall either (i) pay such deficit to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by Buyer, within five (5) Business Days of the final agreement or
determination of such amount in accordance with this Section 2.10, or (ii)
forfeit that number of Kennedy Shares held in the Escrow Fund (valued at the
Agreed Stock Value and rounded up to the nearest whole number of Kennedy
Shares) equal to the amount of such deficit, by joint written instruction of
Buyer, the Shareholder Representatives and Kennedy (which parties agree to
deliver within two (2) Business Days of notification by Kennedy of his
election pursuant to this clause (ii)) instructing the Escrow Agent to release
such number of Kennedy Shares to Buyer, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of such joint written
instruction; _provided_ , that the decision between clauses (i) and (ii) shall
be in Kennedys sole discretion. If Kennedy elects to pay any such deficit
pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.10(g), then the Shareholder

Section 2.10. Such access may be subject to the execution of customary access
letters with respect to the work completed by accountants.

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
such amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 2.12 Shareholder Representative. 

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and as set forth in the
Letters of Transmittal and the Contribution Agreement, Kennedy and Newport
are hereby authorized, directed and appointed to act as sole and exclusive
agents, attorneys-in-fact and representatives of the Shareholders (each a "
_Shareholder Representative_ " and, collectively the " _Shareholder
Representatives_ "), with full power of substitution with respect to all
matters under this Agreement and Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company has designated the Shareholder
Representatives as the representatives of the Shareholders for purposes of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by such holders shall constitute ratification and approval of
such designation on the terms set forth herein. All decisions, actions,
consents, and instructions by the Shareholder Representatives with respect to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be absolutely and irrevocably
binding upon all of the Shareholders with respect to their interests as
shareholders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and no such
Shareholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Shareholder Representatives shall act in
unanimity with respect to any decision, action, consent or instruction
contemplated by this Agreement and in all communications with Buyer and Merger
Sub, and Buyer and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on any such decision,
action, consent or

 



25  instruction as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders. Buyer and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person for acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act,
consent, or instruction. By way of amplification and not limitation, as
Shareholder Representatives, the Shareholder Representatives shall be
authorized and empowered, as agents of and on behalf of all Shareholders
(only with respect to their interests as Shareholders) (i) to give and receive
notices and communications as provided herein, (ii) to receive certain
distributions of the Final Merger Consideration and the China Joint
Venture Dividend for the benefit of the Shareholders, (iii) to object to any
Buyer Indemnification Claims, (iv) to agree to, negotiate, enter into

of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims or Losses,
(v) to resolve any other disputes under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, (vi) to grant any waiver, consent or approval on behalf of the
Shareholders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (except for any
consent or approval of the Shareholders of the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby), (vii) to receive service of process
on behalf of each shareholder of the Company in connection with any claims
against such shareholder arising under or in connection with this Agreement,
any document or instrument provided for hereby or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (ix) to appoint, in its sole discretion, one
or more successor Shareholder Representatives, and (x) to take all other
actions that are either (1) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholder Representatives for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (2)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Notices or
communications to or from both of the Shareholder Representatives shall
constitute notice to or from the Shareholders.

 

(b) Each of the Shareholder Representatives hereby accepts the foregoing
appointment and agrees to serve as a Shareholder Representative, subject to
the provisions hereof, for the period of time from and after the date hereof
without compensation except for the reimbursement or payment from the
Shareholders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) of all fees and
expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representatives in performing his or its
duties hereunder (including legal fees and expenses related thereto) and any
indemnification in favor of the Shareholder Representatives, in each case _pro
rata_ in accordance with the portion of the Final Merger Consideration each
such shareholder would otherwise have been entitled to receive by virtue of
the ownership of outstanding Shares immediately before the Effective Time
(each such shareholders pro rata interest, a " _Pro-Rata Share_ "). The
Company and the Shareholder Representatives will, at least two (2) days prior
to the Closing Date, direct, by joint written notice to Buyer, that on the
Closing Date an amount equal to TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($250,000)
(the " _Shareholder Representatives  Holdback_"), shall be paid directly by
the Surviving Corporation to the Shareholder Representatives as designated in
such notice, as a fund for the fees and expenses of the Shareholder
Representatives incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement (the " _Shareholder Representatives 
Holdback Account_"), with any balance of the Shareholder Representatives
Holdback Account not used for such purposes (as determined by the Shareholder
Representatives in good faith) to be paid by the Shareholder Representatives
to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Share. The
Shareholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the Shareholder
Representatives Holdback and, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and
as set forth in the Letters of Transmittal, irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Shareholder Representatives any ownership right that they may have in
any interest that may accrue on funds held in the Shareholder Representatives
Holdback Account.

 



26  To the extent that the Shareholder Representatives Holdback does not
sufficiently cover the fees and expenses of the Shareholder Representatives
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Indemnity Agreement, such shortfall shall be paid in accordance with the
Contribution Agreement.

(c) In dealing with this Agreement and any notice, instrument, agreement or
document relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any
of the powers conferred upon the Shareholder Representatives hereunder or
thereunder, (i) the Shareholder Representatives and his or its agents,
counsel, accountants and other representatives shall not assume any, and shall
not incur any, responsibility or liability whatsoever to any shareholder of
the Company, except to the extent such actions shall have been determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted willful misconduct or
actual or intentional fraud, and shall be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations are fully authorized by each and every one of
the Shareholders, (ii) the Shareholder Representatives shall be entitled to
rely in good faith on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, (iii) the Shareholder
Representatives shall be entitled to rely on any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement without being required to determine
the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the
propriety or validity of the service thereof, (iv) the Shareholder
Representatives may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature believed
by it to be genuine and may assume that the Person purporting to give receipt
or advice or make any statement or execute any document in connection with the
provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so, and (v) the Shareholder
Representatives may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative
of any party hereto which is an entity other than a natural person has full
power and authority to instruct the Shareholder Representatives on behalf of
that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to
the Shareholder Representatives. Except in cases where a court of competent
jurisdiction has made such a finding, the Shareholders shall on a pro rata
basis (based on each such shareholders Pro-Rata Share) indemnify and hold
harmless the Shareholder Representatives from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with his
or its activities as the Shareholder Representatives under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or otherwise.

(d) The grant of authority provided for in this Section 2.12 is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable and is being granted, in part, as an inducement
to Buyer and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
and shall be irrevocable and survive the dissolution, liquidation or
bankruptcy of the Company or the death, incompetency, liquidation or
bankruptcy of any shareholder of the Company, shall be binding on any
successor thereto and shall survive the assignment by any shareholder of
the Company of the whole or any portion of his or its interest in any payment
due to it under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in the Escrow Fund.
The appointment of the Shareholder Representatives as each shareholders
attorneys-in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore granted that
authorized any other person or persons to represent such shareholder with
regard to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(e) In connection with the performance of his or its obligations hereunder,
the Shareholder Representatives shall have the right, acting together, at any
time and from time to

 



27  time to select and engage, at the cost and expense of the Shareholders (as
contemplated by Section 2.12(b)), attorneys, accountants, investment bankers,
advisors, consultants, and clerical personnel and obtain such other
professional and expert assistance, and maintain such records, as he or it may
deem necessary or desirable and incur other out-of-pocket expenses related to
performing his or its services hereunder. Except for reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses, the Shareholder Representatives shall receive no fees for
their services under this Agreement. The Shareholder Representatives may
act pursuant to the advice of counsel with respect to any matter relating to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice.

 

(f) Buyer hereby agrees that the Shareholder Representatives shall not, in
their capacities as such, have any liability to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates whatsoever with respect to their actions, decisions or
determinations. The Shareholder Representatives hereby agree that Buyer has no
liability to any Person with respect to the actions, decisions or
determinations of the Shareholder Representatives, in their capacity as such.

(g) All of the immunities and powers granted to the Shareholder
Representatives under this Agreement with respect to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement, except that such powers (but not immunities) shall terminate upon
termination of this Agreement.

 

(h) In connection with his or its appointment as a Shareholder Representative
hereunder, each of Kennedy and Newport hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer (only with respect to themselves) that he or it has all requisite power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which he or it will be a party, to perform his or its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by Newport of this

Except as set forth in the corresponding Disclosure Schedules, Buyer makes the
representations and warranties to the Company as set forth below.

Section 4.01 Organization and Authorization.

 

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub are each a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
their incorporation and have all requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it will
be a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery by Buyer and Merger Sub of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party, the performance by Buyer and
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation
by Buyer and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Buyer
and Merger Sub.

 

(b) This Agreement has been, and upon their execution each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which Buyer and/or Merger Sub will be a party will have been,
duly executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Merger Sub. Assuming that
this Agreement constitutes, and, upon their execution, each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which Buyer and/or Merger Sub will be a party will constitute,
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto and
thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution, each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer and/or Merger Sub will be a party will
constitute, the legal, valid, and binding obligations of Buyer and/or Merger
Sub, enforceable against Buyer and/or Merger Sub in accordance with their
respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
similar laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

Section 4.02 Capitalization. As of July 14, 2014, the authorized capital stock
of Buyer consists of (a) forty-five million (45,000,000) shares of Buyer
Common Stock, of which 17,785,621 shares are issued and outstanding, and (b)
five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are
issued and outstanding. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.02_ , Buyer is not
a party to or bound by any option, call warrant, conversion privilege or other
agreement obligating Buyer at present, at any future time, or upon occurrence
of any event to issue or sell any shares of Buyer Common Stock or other
capital stock of Buyer. Since July 14, 2014, Buyer has not issued any shares
of Buyer Common Stock or shares of preferred stock, other than shares issued
as a result of the exercise of options set forth on  _Schedule 4.02_.

Section 4.03 Buyer Common Stock. (a) The shares of Buyer Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement are not, and, at the time of the issuance
of such shares, will not be, subject to any preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal, subscription or similar rights that have

 



47  not been properly waived; and (b) the issuance of shares of Buyer Common
Stock has been, and will be, duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Buyer and when issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
will be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable and free from any
Encumbrance (including, claims or rights under any voting trust agreements,
shareholder agreements or other agreements).

 

Section 4.04 Issuance of Shares; Listing and Maintenance Requirements. Subject
to the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties contained
in the Investor Representation Letter, at the time of each issuance of the
Kennedy Shares under this Agreement, such issuance will be exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, will have been registered or
qualified (or are exempt from registration and qualification) under the
registration, permit or qualification requirements of all applicable state
securities laws and pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and will
have been issued in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations of
NASDAQ (or such other securities exchange or quoting service that makes the
primary market in shares of Buyer Common Stock if it is not then listed on
NASDAQ). Buyer has not, in the twelve (12) months preceding the date hereof,
received notice from NASDAQ to the effect that Buyer is not in compliance with
the listing or maintenance requirements of such trading market. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not
violate the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Buyer has taken no action
designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the effect of,
terminating the registration of Buyer Common Stock under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 4.05 No Conflicts; Consents.

 

(a) The execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer and/or Merger Sub will
be a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not: (i) conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of, or default under, any provision of the certificate
of incorporation, by-laws, or other organizational documents of Buyer and
Merger Sub; (ii) subject to HSR Approval, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Law or Governmental Order
applicable to Buyer or Merger Sub; or (c) except as set forth on _Schedule
4.05_ require the consent, notice or other action by any Person under any
Contract to which Buyer or Merger Sub is a party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no representation or warranty is made in the foregoing clauses (ii),
(iii) or (iv) with respect to matters that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the operation of the
business of Buyer.

 

(b) Except for the HSR Approval, no consent, approval, Permit, Governmental
Order, declaration, or filing or notice with or to any Governmental Authority
is required by or with respect to Buyer or Merger Sub in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements to which it
will be a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation and warranty is
made with respect to consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental Orders,
declarations, filings or notices with or to any Governmental Authority that,
if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay Buyers or Merger Subs
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



48 Section 4.06 Reports and Financial Statements.

 

(a) Buyer has filed with the SEC true and complete copies of all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and any definitive proxy or
information statements required to be filed by Buyer pursuant to the Exchange
Act since January 1, 2013 (the " _SEC Filings_ "), each of which has complied
in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as in effect on the date so filed, except
to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC
Filing filed or furnished to the SEC by Buyer and in either case, publicly
available as of the date hereof or as set forth on _Schedule 4.06(a)_. None
of the SEC Filings (including, any financial statements or schedules included
or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed, and any SEC
Filings filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not contain,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC
Filing.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent SEC Filing filed on or prior to the date hereof, all of Buyers
financial statements included in the SEC Filings, in each case, including any
related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are
collectively referred to as the " _Buyer Financial Statements_ "), have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis through the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC
and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end
audit adjustments which would not reasonably be expected to be
material, individually or in the aggregate). The consolidated balance sheets
(including the related notes) included in such Buyer Financial Statements (if
applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent SEC
Filing) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such
Buyer Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
cash flows of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods
indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-
end audit adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate.

(c) Buyer has designed and maintains a system of "internal controls over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

(d) The management of Buyer has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Buyer, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Buyer by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to Buyers
outside auditors and

 



49  the audit committee of the board of directors of Buyer (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weakness in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Buyers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyers internal
control over financial reporting. Neither Buyer nor any of its consolidated
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever,
whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute, that
are material to Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the
consolidated balance sheet of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2013, including the notes thereto, contained in the SEC Filings,
(ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2013, and
(iv) other liabilities or obligations that are not otherwise covered by
insurance that were not, and could not reasonably be expected to be, material
and adverse to the financial condition, businesses, results of operations,
properties or assets of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 

Section 4.07 Brokers. Except for KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., no broker,
finder, or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

 

Section 4.08 Debt Financing.

 

(a) Buyer has delivered to the Company a true and correct copy of an executed
debt commitment letter addressed to Buyer from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, and KeyBank National Association
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ", and the financing contemplated thereby, the
" _Debt Financing_ "), dated on or before the date hereof, pursuant to which
the lenders named therein have committed, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to lend Buyer the amounts set forth therein for
the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyers cash on hand, together with the amount of funding to be provided in
the Debt Financing, is sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid by
Buyer hereunder and all related fees and expenses. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such
amendment or modification is pending or contemplated. The Debt
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws from time to time in effect
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). There are no other agreements, side letters, undertakings or
arrangements relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that would adversely
affect (x) the ability of Buyer to satisfy any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing within its control, or (y) to the knowledge of Buyer, the
availability of the Debt Financing. To Buyers knowledge, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or
condition of the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the

 



50  funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and the Debt Commitment Letter does
not provide that the parties thereto may impose additional conditions or
other contingences to such funding. Buyer has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be
paid by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof,
Buyer is not aware of any fact or occurrence that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) make any of the
assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect; (ii) result in any of the terms or
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied; (iii) cause the
Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective; or (iv) otherwise result in the
Debt Financing not being available on a timely basis in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Buyer confirms that it is not a condition to Closing or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement that Buyer obtain financing for or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.09 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.09_, there
are no Actions pending or, to Buyers knowledge, threatened against or by
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer that challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin or
otherwise delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.10 Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed by Buyer solely for the purpose
of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged
in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub has no liabilities. Merger Sub is
not a party to any Contract, except for this Agreement, a
subscription agreement pursuant to which all of its authorized capital stock
was issued to Buyer, and contracts with respect to the appointment of
registered agents and similar matters.

 

Section 4.11 Solvency. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
subsidiaries shall, collectively, be able to pay their debts as such debts
become due, will have capital sufficient to carry out their business as now
contemplated, and will own property having a value both at fair
market valuation and at fair saleable value in the ordinary course of
business greater than the amount required to pay their indebtedness and other
obligations as the same mature and become due.

 

Section 4.12 Buyers Reliance. Buyer acknowledges that neither the
Shareholders, the Company nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, written or oral, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information that the Company and the Subsidiaries
furnished or made available to Buyer and its Representatives, except as
expressly set forth in Article III, and neither the Shareholders, the Company
nor any other Person (including any officer, director, member or partner
thereof or any of their respective Affiliates) shall have or be subject to any
liability to Buyer, or any other Person, resulting from Buyers use of any
information, documents or material made available to Buyer in any "data
rooms," management presentations, due diligence or in any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer acknowledges that,
should the Closing occur, Buyer shall acquire the Company and the Subsidiaries
without any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for
any particular purpose of their respective assets, in an "as is" condition
and on a

Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 4.12 is
intended to limit or modify the representations and warranties contained in

warranties made by Buyer and Merger Sub in this Article IV (including as
modified by the Disclosure Schedules) are the exclusive representations and
warranties made by Buyer and Merger Sub. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub hereby
disclaims any other express or implied representations or warranties, whether
written or oral, including as to the condition, value or quality of Buyers or
Merger Subs business or their respective assets. Buyer and Merger Sub are
not, directly or indirectly, making any representations or warranties

56 Section 5.06 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

required pursuant to the HSR Act.

(b) Each of Buyer and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, make, or
cause to be made, all other filings and submissions required under any Laws
applicable to it, or to their respective Affiliates, as may be required for

consents, authorizations, orders and approvals (other than those contemplated
by Section 5.06(a)) from all Governmental Authorities that may be necessary
for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it will be a party. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other
party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully
take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties set forth in
_Schedule 5.06(c)_. The Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other

or notices with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be required from or to parties to Contracts to which the Company or a
Subsidiary is a party and certain Permits or consents, approvals, waivers
or notices thereto may be required from or to Governmental Authorities and
that such consents, approvals, waivers, notices or Permits have not been and

shall not have any liability to Buyer arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain or make any consents, approvals, waivers, notices or Permits
that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract or Permit as a result
thereof, except to the extent such matter involves the breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement. If any
consent, approval, or authorization necessary to preserve any right
or benefit under any Contract to which the Company is a party or under any
Permit is not obtained before the Closing, the Shareholder Representatives (at
no cost to the Shareholder Representatives or the Shareholders) and Buyer
shall, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval, or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.

 



57 (d) Buyer and the Company shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
exchanging and providing such information to each other and in making the
filings and requests referred to in this Section 5.06. Buyer and the Company
shall supply such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested by the
other party hereto in connection with the foregoing.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, each of the parties hereto shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to:

(i) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any agreement or document contemplated hereby or any Ancillary Agreement; and

 

(ii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any agreement or document contemplated hereby or any Ancillary Agreement, has
been issued, to have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take all actions and to obtain, or cause to be obtained,
all authorizations, approvals and consents under applicable Antitrust Laws as
may be required for it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance of the foregoing, if any Governmental Order or any suit is
threatened or instituted challenging any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, Buyer, or any of its
Affiliates, shall take any and all such action (except for any agreement to
hold separate or to divest any of the assets, businesses, product lines or
interests of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, after the Closing
Date, of the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates) as may be
required (x) by the applicable Governmental Authority (including the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or the Federal
Trade Commission) in order to resolve such objections as such Governmental
Authority may have to such transactions under such Antitrust Law or (y)
by any domestic or foreign court or similar tribunal, in any suit brought by
any Person or Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order that has the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any party or any Affiliate thereof receives
a request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the extent
required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the parties will
provide truthful and accurate information and documentation to the applicable
Governmental Authority; _provided_ , that each party shall only be liable for
the truth and accuracy of the information and documentation provided by such
party and such partys Affiliates. None of the parties to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting 

 



58  with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Buyer will advise the Company and
the Shareholder Representatives promptly in respect of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Buyer proposes to make or
enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire
any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of
not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization, declaration, waiver,
license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries will continue to
undertake all measures deemed by the Company to be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to facilitate and accelerate the applications process to obtain
the Marnaz Permit. Following the Closing, Buyer will use its best efforts to
minimize the cost associated with obtaining the Marnaz Permit.

make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the

 



60  transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news
media without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent

2014 year in January of 2015 according to existing formulas as accrued on the

to, take into account and recognize all service rendered by each Company
Employee prior to the Closing Date for all purposes including participation,
coverage, vesting, and level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit

that nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any benefits. Without
limiting the foregoing, Company Employees shall not be subject to any pre-
existing condition or limitation under any health or welfare plan of Buyer or
its subsidiaries for any condition for which such employee would have been
entitled to coverage under the corresponding Benefit Plan in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. With respect to

contrary herein, Buyer shall provide, or cause the Company or applicable
Subsidiary to provide, each Company Employee who suffers a termination of
employment during the first twelve (12) months following the Closing Date

payments and benefits under a Company Severance Plan with severance payments
and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to
such Company Employee under the applicable Company Severance Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in this
Section 5.15, whether express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any current
or former employee of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary any entitlement,
rights, or remedies (including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period), of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 5.15 or (ii) restrict Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary from terminating the employment of any individual, including

the Company or any Subsidiary.

operations of the China Joint Venture for the fiscal year ended December 31,

fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days from, and
including, January 1, 2014, to, and including, the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is 365 calendar days (the " _Shareholder s Dividend
Allocation_"), minus (ii) 10% of the Shareholders Dividend Allocation (the
result of (i) minus (ii), the " _Dividend Net Withholding Amount_ "), minus
(b) 30.2% of the Dividend Net Withholding Amount. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would prevent, impair, delay or
otherwise interfere with the China Joint Ventures ability to pay, or its
payment of, the China Joint Venture Dividend in the year 2015 in accordance
with its ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

Section 5.18 Financing and Financing Cooperation.

restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter, including,
without limitation, (x) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (y) to implement any
flex provisions applicable thereto so long as, in each case, taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, such action would not
reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the financing below the amount necessary (after
giving effect to any other debt and cash on hand) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) impose additional conditions that
would reasonably be expected to make the Debt Financing, in an amount
necessary (together with any other debt and cash on hand) to consummate the
Closing, less likely to be obtained or (iv) materially and adversely impact
the ability of the Buyer to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (1) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection therewith, (2)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter for as long as the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are required to be consummated,
(3) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer and Merger Sub in the
Debt Commitment Letter that are within their control and otherwise comply in
all material respects with its obligations thereunder, (4) negotiate
definitive

 



63  agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including, to
the extent the same are exercised, the flex provisions) contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms acceptable to Buyer that would not
(I) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (II) impose new or
additional conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in the
case of this clause (II) in a manner that, taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing Date, (5) if all of the conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letter and all of the conditions to Buyers and Merger Subs
obligations under Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions
that, by their terms, will be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been
satisfied or waived, consummate the Debt Financing at Closing and (6) so long
as the conditions in the immediately preceding clause (5) have been satisfied,
enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or default by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (x) breach,
default, termination or repudiation of the Debt Commitment Letter by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) material dispute between or among
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Debt Financing Sources, on the other hand,
with respect to the availability of the Debt Financing; (C) if for any reason
Buyer or Merger Sub believes in good faith that (x) there is a material
dispute between or among Buyer, on the one hand, and the Debt Financing
Sources, on the other hand, with respect to the availability of the Debt
Financing or (y) there is a material possibility that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (D) if for
any reason any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
disclose any information to the extent that (1) such information is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege (but only if such privilege is asserted
in good faith) or (2) the disclosure of which would be prohibited
or restricted by applicable Law. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within three (3) Business Days, after the date the Company delivers
to Buyer or Merger Sub a written request, Buyer and Merger Sub shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of the immediately
preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event; it being
understood that Buyer shall have no obligation to accept terms that are
materially less favorable, taken as a whole (after taking into account any
flex provisions), to Buyer than those included in the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof. Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing (subject to any applicable restrictions in the
Debt Commitment Letter). For purposes of this Agreement, the definitions of
"Debt Commitment Letter," "Debt Financing" and related definitions shall
include the Debt Commitment Letter and, if entered into prior to Closing, any
document related thereto as the same may be amended, waived, modified or
replaced pursuant to this Section 5.18(a).

 



64 (b) Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article IX, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
use commercially reasonable efforts) to provide, and shall use each of their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
provide, in each case, with Buyers reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (in accordance with the
reimbursement provisions of Section 10.01), all customary cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer and that is necessary in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing (or, if applicable, any permitted
replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing) (provided that
such requested cooperation is consistent with applicable Law), including
using commercially reasonable efforts in connection with (i) furnishing Buyer
and the Debt Financing Sources the Company Financing Information, (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings at reasonable times
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt
Financing and members of senior management and representatives of the
Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, in
each case with reasonable advance notice, (iii) assisting Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources with the preparation of (A) offering documents and
confidential information memoranda for any portion of the Debt Financing
(including the "Information Materials" as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and (B) reasonable and customary materials for rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including the delivery of
one or more customary representation and authorization letters) and similar
documents reasonably and customarily required in connection with the Debt
Financing (including the delivery of any consents of accountants for use of
their reports), (iv) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral, (v)
obtaining accountants comfort letters, local counsel opinions, landlord
consents, deposit account control agreements, waivers and estoppels, surveys
and title insurance reasonably requested by Buyer and customary
for financings similar to the Debt Financing and obtaining third party
consents in connection with the Debt Financing, and, if applicable, in
extinguishing existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
releasing Encumbrances securing any such Indebtedness, in each case, to take
effect at the Closing, (vi) assisting Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources in
the completion of a physical inventory with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries inventories for the purposes of their review of collateral
granted pursuant to the Debt Financing or otherwise and taking all actions
reasonably necessary to permit the Debt Financing Sources to conduct audit
examinations, appraisals and other evaluations with respect to the Companys
current assets and other collateral, and to evaluate its cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes
of establishing collateral arrangements, (vii) ensuring that the syndication
efforts of the Debt Financing Sources benefit materially from existing banking
relationships of the Company and (viii) at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other information about the
Company as is reasonably requested in writing by Buyer at least seven Business
Days prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing and that
relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act; _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (a)
irrespective of the above, no obligation of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument referenced in
subsection (iv) or (v) above (other than the authorization letters

 



65  referred to above and deliverable prior to Closing) shall be effective until
the Closing occurs and none of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument
that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to
the Closing, (b) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or the Subsidiaries in any material respect, (c) none of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering document,
(d) none of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall be obligated to
provide (and Buyer and Merger Sub shall not disclose) any information about
the Company or the Subsidiaries to the extent that (1) such information is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (but only if such privilege
is asserted in good faith) or (2) the disclosure of which would be prohibited
or restricted by applicable Law, and (e) no personal liability shall be
imposed on the officers, directors, managers, employers or agents involved;
_provided, further,_ that neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
shall be required to bear any cost or expense or pay any commitment fee or
other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability (other than a
liability (x) that is contingent upon the Closing occurring or (y) in respect
of which the Buyer has agreed to provide reimbursement, including, without
limitation, pursuant to this Section 5.18 or Section 10.01 hereof) or to
provide or agree to provide any indemnity with respect to the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time, or any of the foregoing that would be treated as
a Company Transaction Expense. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives and Affiliates
from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with this Section 5.18(b)) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than the Company Financing Information and the
historical information relating to Company or the Subsidiaries provided by
Company in writing specifically for use in the marketing materials for the
Debt Financing), except to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. Whether or not
the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall reimburse the Company in connection with
the cooperation of the Company and the Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 5.18(b) in accordance with Section 10.01. All material non-public
information provided by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall be kept confidential,
except that Buyer shall be permitted to disclose such information to its
advisors, the Debt Financing Sources and the affiliates, employees,
representatives, agents and advisors of any Debt Financing Source and other
potential sources of capital, rating agencies and prospective lenders and
investors during syndication of the Debt Financing or any permitted
replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing subject to the
potential sources of capital, ratings agencies and prospective lenders and
investors entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to
such information (including through a notice and undertaking in a form
customarily used in confidential information memoranda for senior credit
facilities). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and the
Subsidiaries names, marks and logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided that such names, marks and logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended or not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall not be deemed in default due to a breach of its
obligations under this Section 5.18 unless such breach materially contributed
to a failure to obtain the Debt Financing.

 



66 Section 5.19 Board of Directors. Immediately following the Effective
Time, Buyers board of directors shall be increased to eight (8) members and
Buyers board of directors shall fill the newly created vacancy by immediately
appointing Kennedy to the Buyers board of directors as a Class I director,
to serve until the 2017 annual meeting of Buyers stockholders (and until
their successors have been duly elected and qualified), in all cases subject
to the satisfaction and compliance of Kennedy with Buyers then-current
corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics and
other board of director policies relating to nomination and qualification of
directors.

 

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS 

Section 6.01 Tax Covenants.

 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Company and the Subsidiaries (and,
before the Closing, the Companys Affiliates and its Representatives) shall
not, to the extent it may affect, or relate to, the Company or the
Subsidiaries, make, change or rescind any material Tax election, change an
annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any
material amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any
material Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries,
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or take any other similar
action outside of the ordinary course inconsistent with past practice relating
to the filing of any material Tax Return or the payment of any material Tax,
if such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement,
surrender, consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax
liability of Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries in respect of any Post-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added,
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including any
real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid
by the Shareholders when due. The Company shall, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries to, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary).

 

(c) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and
without a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be
submitted by Buyer to the Shareholder Representatives (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by the Shareholder
Representatives, supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days before
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If the Shareholder
Representatives object to any item on any such Tax Return, they shall, within
ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer in writing that
it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the
specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of
objection shall be duly delivered, Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives
are unable to reach

 



67  such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer of such notice,
the disputed items shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting
firm selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Shareholder
Representatives (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") and any determination by the
Accounting Referee shall be final. The Accounting Referee shall resolve any
disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Accounting Referee is
unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return,
the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer and then amended to
reflect the Accounting Referees resolution. The costs, fees, and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Shareholder Representatives, on the other hand (from the
Shareholder Representatives Holdback or pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement, as applicable). The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be exclusively within the control of Buyer.

(d) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (or with respect
to any Straddle Period) without the written consent of the Shareholder
Representatives, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the
Shareholder Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Tax
Return is filed while a Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which the Shareholder
Representatives or Buyer might have an indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 8.02(a)(iii) is pending, and such Tax Return must be amended as a
result of and based upon the resolution of such Tax Claim, Buyer agrees to
amend such Tax Return solely to reflect the resolution of such Contest and
the Shareholder Representatives shall not withhold its consent to such
amendment.

 

Section 6.02 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Except for any
existing Tax sharing agreements between or among the Subsidiaries, any and
all existing Tax sharing agreements binding upon the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none
of the Company or the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall
have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

Section 6.03 Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
(each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes
that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement shall
be:

(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or receipts, deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the
Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period.

 

For purposes of clause (a) of the preceding sentence, any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item (including, without limitation, the effect of
any graduated rates of tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing

 



68  Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such
item allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or
measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 6.03 shall be
computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall
be made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any
Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of business
on the Closing Date.

Section 6.04 Contests.

 

(a) After the Closing, each party to this Agreement (whether Buyer or the
Shareholder Representatives, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of
an audit received by such party from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person with respect to Taxes for which such other party is liable pursuant
to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
a failure to give such notice will not affect such other partys rights to
indemnification under Article VIII, except to the extent that such party
is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include
copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability.

(b) The Shareholder Representatives shall control the conduct, through
counsel of its own choosing at its own expense, of any Action, audit, claim
for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted
Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (any such Action, audit, claim for refund, or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability in respect of which an indemnity may be
sought by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(iii) referred to herein as a "
_Tax Claim_ ") relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

(c) In the case of a Contest that relates to Straddle Periods (as defined in
Section 6.03 above), Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Claim, but
the Shareholder Representatives shall have the right to participate in such
Tax Claim at their own expense (payable from the Shareholder Representatives
Holdback or pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, as applicable) and, with
the written consent of Buyer, in Buyers sole discretion, and at their expense
(payable from the Shareholder Representatives Holdback or pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement, as applicable), may assume control of the conduct of
such Tax Claim. Neither Buyer, the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall
settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Claim without the consent of the
Shareholder Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Buyer fails to assume control of the
conduct of any such Tax Claim within a reasonable period following the receipt
by Buyer of notice of such Tax Claim, the Shareholder Representatives shall
have the right to assume control of such Tax Claim and shall be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Claim in their sole discretion.

 



69 Section 6.05 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Shareholder
Representatives and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return pursuant to this Article VI or in connection with any audit or
other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies
of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Shareholder Representatives and
Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and
other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods
to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Before transferring,
destroying, or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date, Shareholder Representatives or Buyer (as the case may be) shall provide
the other party with reasonable written notice and offer the other party the
opportunity to take custody of such materials. Any information obtained under
this Section 6.05 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a
Tax Claim or other Tax proceeding.

Section 6.06 Tax Elections. Buyer shall not, without the prior consent of the
Shareholder Representatives (which may, in their sole and absolute
discretion, withhold such consent), make, or cause to permit to be made, any
Tax election, or adopt or change any method of accounting, or undertake any
extraordinary action on the Closing Date, that would affect the Shareholders
or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for any period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.07 Refunds.

 

(a) The Shareholder Representatives, on behalf of the Shareholders, will be
entitled to any credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in
respect of any Pre-Closing Taxable Period except with respect to the carryback
of any Tax benefits from Post-Closing Tax Periods. Buyer shall cause such
refund or the amount of such credit to be paid to the Shareholder
Representatives, on behalf of the Shareholders, promptly after it is
received, allowed or applied against any Tax liability.

(b) Except as provided in Section 6.07(a), the Company will be entitled to
any credits and refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect
of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries

 

Section 6.08 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility
pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this Article VI, the provisions of this Article VI shall govern.

__(b) any and all out-of-pocket costs incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties in connection with (i) any expenditures at the Marnaz, France

termination of employees, relocation of employees, and relocation of equipment
at the Marnaz, France facility directly related to the failure to obtain the
Marnaz Permit, in each of cases (i) and (ii), incurred over the course of the

applicable to such representation or warranty; _provided, however_ , that such

required pursuant to Environmental Laws.

 

(g) Section 8.02(a)(vi) shall be the sole source of indemnification under this
Agreement for Losses as a result of, arising out of or relating to any
Releases of Hazardous Materials at the Real Property at Dowagiac, Michigan,
Marnaz, France or Kamienna Gora, Poland arising out of an environmental
condition identified in the Phase One environmental site assessment of such
Real Property listed in Item 2 of _Schedule 3.19_.

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures.

 

 __(a) _Order of Claims._ Losses indemnifiable by the Shareholders pursuant to
Section 8.02 shall first be payable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties by
Kennedy, either (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or (ii) by
forfeiting that number of Kennedy Shares held in the Escrow Fund (valued at
the Agreed Stock Value and rounded up to the nearest whole number of Kennedy
Shares) equal to such Losses, by joint written instruction of Buyer, the
Shareholder Representatives and Kennedy instructing the Escrow Agent to
release such number of Kennedy Shares to Buyer pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; _provided,_ that the decision between clauses (i) and (ii)
shall be in Kennedys sole discretion. If Kennedy elects to pay any such
Losses pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.05(a), then the Shareholder
Representatives, Buyer and Kennedy shall promptly, but in any event no later
than one (1) Business Day after confirmation by Buyer that the corresponding
wire transfer has been received by Buyer, deliver a joint written instruction
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Kennedy that
number of Kennedy Shares held in the Escrow Fund (valued at the Agreed Stock
Value for each Kennedy Share and rounded up to the nearest whole number of
Kennedy Shares) corresponding to the amount so paid by Kennedy in such wire
transfer to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. If any Losses indemnifiable by the Shareholders pursuant to
Section 8.02 exceed the then-current balance of the Escrow Fund (valued at the
Agreed Stock Value for each Kennedy Share held therein), then such excess
shall be payable by each Shareholder, severally, and not jointly, in
proportion to their Pro-Rata Share, up to the Cap or the Merger Consideration
Cap, as applicable, and pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement. __

 

(b) _Non-Third Party Claims Process_. The Buyer Indemnified Party or the
Seller Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will deliver a
written notice (a " _Claims_

 



76   _Notice_ ") to the Shareholder Representatives, on behalf of the
Shareholders, or to Buyer, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party
may be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall (i) describe such claim in reasonable
detail and state the amount or estimated amount of Losses, (ii) state that
the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates in
good faith that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) if
paid or accrued, state the date such item was paid or accrued. The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party
and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall
include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in
the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal
and business assistance with respect to such matters. The party requesting
assistance shall pay the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses of all Persons
providing such assistance.

Section 8.06 Third Party Claims.

 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving
a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person not a party to this Agreement
against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnifying Party, as soon as
practicable, describing such claim in reasonable detail and stating the amount
or estimated amount of such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or
failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve an Indemnifying Party from its obligations
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially prejudiced (and
then solely to the extent of such prejudice).

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claims Notice, to
assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period set forth
in this Section 8.06(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to
assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing; (ii)
does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff
of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim; or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the
Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which

 



77  the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

 

Section 8.07 Escrow.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. To provide a fund against which a Buyer Indemnified Party
may assert claims of indemnification under this Article VIII (each a " _Buyer
Indemnification Claim_ "), the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into escrow
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with Section 2.09(a). The
Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed in accordance with this Article
VIII, Section 2.10 and the Escrow Agreement. Each Buyer Indemnification Claim
shall be made only in accordance with this Article VIII, Section 2.10, the
Escrow Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement. A Buyer Indemnified Party shall
seek monetary recourse for Buyer Indemnification Claims solely as set forth in
Section 8.05(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of the limitations set forth in this Article VIII shall
apply to any action for specific performance, injunctive relief, or other
equitable remedy.

(b) _Reserved Amounts in the Escrow Fund; Release in respect of Claims_. In
the event any Buyer Indemnification Claim is made by a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to a Claims Notice delivered to the Shareholder Representatives prior
to the Final Escrow Release Date, such Buyer Indemnified Party and the
Shareholder Representatives shall negotiate in good faith to reach an
agreement upon the amount on deposit in the Escrow Fund (valued at the Agreed
Stock Value for each Kennedy Share held therein) that should be reserved in
respect of such Claims Notice (a " _Reserved Amount_ "). If such Persons are
unable to reach agreement as to the Reserved Amount by the Final Release Date,
then the Reserved Amount with respect to such Claims Notice shall be the
amount in good faith specified by the Buyer Indemnified Party in the Claims
Notice based on the Buyer Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment (but in all
cases valuing each Kennedy Share at the Agreed Stock Value). Upon the
agreement by the Shareholder Representatives and the Buyer Indemnified Party
or as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of
any Claims Notice, any amounts payable with respect to any Losses in a Claims
Notice to the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be payable in accordance with
Section 8.05(a).

(c) _Release from Escrow_.

 

(i) At the expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Initial Release Date_ "),
the Initial Escrow Release shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to
Kennedy, in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Twenty-
four (24) months after the Closing Date (the " _Final Release Date_ "), the
Escrow Agent shall, subject to the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement,
disburse to Kennedy the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund which exceeds any
Reserved Amounts in respect of Buyer Indemnification Claims pending, but not
yet paid.

 

(ii) Following the Final Release Date, from time to time, upon resolution of
any Claims Notice in respect of any Buyer Indemnification Claim and the
appropriate amount, if any, from the Escrow Fund having been paid to the Buyer
Indemnified Party (or released to Kennedy in the event Kennedy has paid such
amount pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.05(a)) in 

 



78  respect of such Claims Notice, the Shareholder Representatives, Kennedy and
Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Kennedy the excess
of the then-current balance in the Escrow Fund (valued at the Agreed Stock
Value for each Kennedy Share held therein) over the aggregate Reserved Amounts
in respect of all remaining unresolved Buyer Indemnification Claims made prior
to the Final Release Date, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Agreement, in the event any
Losses payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII
exceed the then-current balance of the Escrow Fund (valued at the Agreed Stock
Value for each Kennedy Share held therein), Kennedy shall have the right, in
his sole discretion, to satisfy his Pro-Rata Share of any such Losses by
transferring to the Buyer Indemnified Party ownership of such portion of the
Kennedy Shares (valued at the Agreed Stock Value for each Kennedy Share) equal
in value to his Pro-Rata Share of any such Losses. Kennedy and Buyer will
promptly provide the necessary instructions to the Buyers transfer agent for
the transfer of such Kennedy Shares.

 

Section 8.08 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business
Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication as set forth in Section
8.05(a) or, if payable to a Seller Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should an
Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest
from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final,
non-appealable adjudication to and including the date such payment has been
made at a rate per annum equal to 4.0%. Such interest shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a calendar year. 

Section 8.09 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, and the parties shall
file their Tax Returns accordingly.

 

Section 8.10 Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any
amounts (a) actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or any other source of indemnification with respect to such Loss, and
(b) accrued on the Company or any Subsidiarys balance sheet as of
the Closing Date and taken into account in the calculation of the Final
Merger Consideration with respect to such Loss, and shall be reduced to take
into account any net Tax Benefit. All indemnification payments for Losses made
pursuant to this Article VIII shall be made on an after-Tax basis.
Accordingly, in determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a
Loss suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of
such Loss shall be decreased to take into account any deduction, credit or
other tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss after taking into account any income, gain or other tax cost
realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to the accrual or receipt of
any indemnification payment or any other payment with respect to such Loss ("
_Tax Benefits_ "). In computing the amount of any such net Tax Benefit, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
accrual or receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any indemnified Loss; _provided, that_ , if a net Tax Benefit is
not realized in the

 



79  taxable period during which an Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification
payment or the Indemnified Party incurs or pays any Loss, the parties hereto
shall thereafter make payments to one another at the end of each subsequent
taxable period to reflect the net Tax Benefit realized by the parties hereto
in each such subsequent taxable period.

 

Section 8.11 [Reserved].

 

Section 8.12 Subrogation. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
Article VIII) in connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than
the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified
Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand
against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim.

 

Section 8.13 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition set forth
in Sections 7.02 and 7.03, as the case may be.

Section 8.14 Exclusive Remedies. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, except (a) as set forth in Section 10.11 ( _Specific
Performance_ ), (b) as set forth in Section 9.03, (c) for any claim under the
terms of the Escrow Agreement or Indemnity Agreement, and (d) for any
claim of Fraud, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any and all breaches
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall
be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and this
Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims, and
causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VI and this Article VIII and the terms of the Indemnity
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.14 shall limit any Persons right to
seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or
to seek any remedy on account of any partys Fraud. No current or former
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder,
agent, attorney or representative of any shareholder of the Company or any of
their Affiliates, shall have any Liability for any obligations or Liabilities
of the Shareholders under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any
other agreements contemplated hereunder or thereunder, or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, except in connection with the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.

accordance with Section 9.01(b)(iii), then promptly, but in any event within
five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, the Company shall
pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to NINE MILLION DOLLARS ($9,000,000) (the
" _Company Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by Buyer. Buyer shall have
the right to assign its right to receive the Company Termination Fee to one or
more Persons in its sole discretion.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
otherwise enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails to pay
the Reverse Termination Fee, the Termination Fee or the Company Termination
Fee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 9.03(a), (b) or (c), respectively, on
or prior to the date such amount is due hereunder, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the other party commences an action or proceeding that results
in a final, nonappealable judgment for the payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee, the Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 9.03, Buyer or the Company, as applicable, shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the other party interest on such amount at an annual rate
equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such amount was originally due hereunder which shall accrue from such
date through the date such payment is actually delivered to such party, and
the costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by such party in connection with such action or proceeding.

 



83 (e) In the event that either party is required to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee, the Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 9.03(a), (b) or (c), respectively, and such party timely
pays the full Reverse Termination Fee, Termination Fee or Company Termination
Fee, as applicable, payment of such fee (together with any amounts paid or
payable pursuant to Section 9.03(d)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the party hereto receiving such fee and its Affiliates against any other
Person (including, without limitation, the Debt Financing Sources and the
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties), other than in connection with the
enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreement against the parties thereto, for
any losses, damages or liabilities suffered or incurred as a result of or
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the failure of the Closing to occur and such party hereto receiving
such fee shall not bring or permit any of its respective Affiliates to bring
any action, suit or other proceeding in connection with any such failure of
the Closing to occur.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall any
party be required to pay the full Reverse Termination Fee, Termination Fee or
Company Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion and (ii) any
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, the Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee described in this Section 9.03 is not a penalty but is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the other party
in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits attached to,
this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument, or other document means such
agreement, instrument, or other document as amended, supplemented, and
modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof;
and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and
includes any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated

Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with, and as an
integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. Any matter, information or item disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules delivered under any specific representation, warranty or covenant
or Schedule number hereof, shall be deemed to have been disclosed for all
purposes of this Agreement in response to every representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement in respect of which such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any matter, information or
item in any Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission of any liability by the Company to any third party or
otherwise imply, that any such matter, information or item is material or
creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement

Section 10.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 



87 Section 10.05 Severability. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Exhibits
and Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, the Ancillary Agreements and any
other agreements contemplated hereby constitute the sole and entire agreement
of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained
herein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and
agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the
event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the other Ancillary Agreements, the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules (other than any exception expressly set forth as such in
the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

 

Section 10.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided however
that Buyer may, without the consent of any other party hereto, assign any and
all of its rights and obligations hereunder to the Debt Financing Sources for
collateral security purposes in connection with the Debt Financing. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

Section 8.14, (b) Kennedy, with respect to Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04 and 4.06

10.12 and this Section 10.08, all of whom shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement solely with respect to such Sections, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

Section 10.09 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified, or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so
waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach, or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any

  



88  single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. Sections 9.02, 9.03(e), 10.07,
10.08, 10.10(b), 10.10(c) and 10.12 and this Section 10.09 (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver, supplement
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of such
Sections) may not be amended, modified, waived, supplemented or terminated in
any manner that adversely impacts or is adverse in any respect to any of the
Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties without the
prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 10.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction), except for (i) provisions in this Agreement with respect
to the effectiveness of the Merger and statutory rights of the Shareholders,
which shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan and (ii) set
forth in clause (b) below.

 

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY

(UNLESS THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE DECLINES TO ACCEPT
JURISDICTION OVER A PARTICULAR MATTER, IN WHICH CASE, IN ANY STATE OR
FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE), AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION,
OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE, OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL
TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF
PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT.
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING
OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limitation
of Sections 9.03(e) and 10.12, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not bring or support any proceeding, suit, litigation, investigation, action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New
York County, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in
the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and that in connection with any
such suit, litigation, investigation, action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third party claim the governing law specified the Debt Commitment
Letter shall govern.

 



89 (c) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

equity, and the parties hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any

the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside
