This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 16, 2017 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Agreement_ "),
is entered into by and among First Eagle Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), FE Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly-owned, direct Subsidiary of Parent (" _Buyer_ "), FE
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned, direct Subsidiary
of Buyer (" _Merger Sub_ "), and NewStar Financial, Inc., a Delaware

Recitals

WHEREAS, the parties intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_
"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company is entering into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _Asset Purchase
Agreement_ ") with GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Asset Buyer_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Asset Buyer
or Subsidiaries of the Asset Buyer will acquire the Purchased Assets and
assume the Assumed Liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b)
adopted resolutions approving this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and declaring
the advisability of this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (c) resolved to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

 

Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall terminate. 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ ") a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such
form as required by, and executed by the parties in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall mean the time when the Merger becomes effective,
which shall be upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other
subsequent time on the Closing Date as the parties may agree and as is set
forth in the Certificate of Merger; but which in any event shall be after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any of
the Purchased Assets) of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not any of the Assumed Liabilities) of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.4 _Closing of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties, at
the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York,
NY 10017, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on the date that is the third (3rd)
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions (other than those conditions which by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing) set forth in _Article VI_. The
date on which the Closing occurs is the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety
as set forth on Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.6 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be
amended so as to read in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit B hereto and,
as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.7 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and

 



2  bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal. At the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly appointed, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

ARTICLE II.

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, without any action
on the part of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any of
the shares of capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub, the Merger shall be
effected in accordance with the following terms:

 

(a) All shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") owned by the Company (including treasury shares) or
owned by Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity for the benefit of customers or clients) shall be cancelled and
retired and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such
shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted automatically into and become thereafter the right
to receive (i) $11.44 in cash, without interest (the " _Upfront Per Share
Consideration_ ") and (ii) one contractual contingent value right (a "
_Contingent Value Right_ " and, together with the Upfront Per Share
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and extinguished
automatically, shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and
each former holder of such shares will cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares, except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor in accordance with and subject to this _Article
II_.

 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to demand, and
have properly demanded, their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be cancelled or converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, such holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to
have been each cancelled and converted, at the Effective Time, into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law that are received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity
to lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
payment under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time Parent shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, settle or compromise (or offer to settle or
compromise) any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

2.3 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Option_ ") under the 2006
Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended to the date hereof, the " _Company
Stock Plan_ ") whether or not vested, which is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall, without any action on the part of Parent,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, and in
consideration for such cancelled Company Option, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive (less applicable withholding Taxes) (i) a cash payment
(without any interest) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Upfront Per Share Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option  _multiplied_ by (y) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option,
which payment shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time and (ii) one Contingent Value Right for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. As of the Effective Time,
each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except for the right to receive the consideration therefor, if any,
in accordance with and subject to this _Section 2.3(a)_. Any Company Options
with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time in exchange for no consideration.

 



4 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is subject
to vesting (whether time-based, performance-based, or otherwise) (" _Company
Restricted Stock_ " and together with the Company Options the " _Company
Equity Awards_ ") shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled upon proper surrender of the Certificate therefor to
receive in consideration for each such cancelled share (less applicable
withholding Taxes): (i) a cash payment (without any interest) equal to the
Upfront Per Share Consideration, payable by the Surviving Corporation no later
than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time and (ii) one Contingent Value Right. As of the
Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the
consideration therefor in accordance with and subject to this  _Section
2.3(b)_. In no event shall this _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ result
in a duplication of benefits in respect to any Company Restricted Stock.

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary (i) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.3_, and (ii) to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (A) the Company Stock Plan shall terminate and (B) no holder
of a Company Equity Award shall have any rights with respect thereto,
including any rights to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by
this  _Section 2.3_ in cancellation thereof. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, funds with the Surviving
Corporation to the extent necessary for the Surviving Corporation to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.3(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.3(b)(i)_.

2.4 _Treatment of the Company Warrants_. Effective as of the Effective Time,
each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is then
outstanding (each, a " _Company Warrant_ ") shall become exercisable solely
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms thereof and
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set
forth in the applicable Company Warrant in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall timely deliver
all notices as described in Section 2.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter to
each holder of a Company Warrant, and take any other actions to the extent
necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants to effectuate the
provisions of this  _Section 2.4_.

2.5 _Paying Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the
Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited (including by
directing the Company to deposit the proceeds paid to the Company by the Asset
Buyer in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Asset Purchase Agreement), with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay the aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration with respect to all shares
of Company Common Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled
Shares and Dissenting Shares) (the " _Upfront Consideration Payment Fund_ ").

 



5  With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be required to deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration payable in respect of such
Dissenting Shares promptly following the holder thereof failing to perfect or
effectively withdrawing or losing its right to dissent under the DGCL.

 

(b) The cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.5_
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in time or demand deposits, certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Upfront
Per Share Consideration with respect to shares of Company Common Stock as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be
replaced or restored, the portion of the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund
lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Upfront Consideration Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part of the Upfront Consideration Payment
Fund, and any amount in excess of the amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Upfront Per Share Consideration with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall be promptly returned to Parent, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall not be used for any purpose other than
as contemplated by this  _Section 2.5_.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, if any (each a "
_Certificate_ ") and each former holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than holders of
Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), transmittal
materials, including a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration).

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange
and cancellation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials and instructions, the holder of record of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (other than Company Restricted Stock,
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so

 



6  surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. Promptly after such surrender,
the Paying Agent shall pay to the holder thereof an amount equal to the
aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration for the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, upon the provision of
reasonable documents by the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered, at the request of Parent, to Parent, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, and any payments with respect to any Contingent Value Rights that
any former stockholder is entitled to receive, but has not properly
surrendered the applicable Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
such Contingent Value Rights by the time of the final distribution of any
Remaining Refund Payment, shall be returned to Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation by the CVR Agent at Parents request upon the final distribution
of any Remaining Refund Payment under _Section 2.6(g)_. Any holders of
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (other than Company Restricted Stock,
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Upfront Per Share Consideration or such payment with respect
to the Contingent Value Rights, as applicable.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, the
CVR Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, such Person
shall be entitled to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect
to all shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate. 

 



7 2.6 _Contingent Value Rights_.

 

(a) Each holder of a Contingent Value Right shall have the right to receive
the payments set forth in this _Section 2.6_. The Contingent Value Rights
will not represent any equity or ownership interest in the Company, Parent,
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof, in any constituent company to the Merger, or
in any other Person and will not be represented by any certificates or other
instruments. The Contingent Value Rights will not have any voting or dividend
rights, and except as set forth in _Section 2.6(k)_, no interest shall accrue
on any amounts payable on the Contingent Value Rights to any holder thereof. 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Buyer shall designate an agent,
which may be the same Person as the Paying Agent, that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to hold the Net Tax Refunds in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 2.6_ (the " _CVR Agent_ ").

 

(c) As a result of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the Company anticipates that it will recognize a loss for
U.S. federal and state income tax purposes (the " _Asset Purchase Loss_ ").
Following the Closing, at the direction of the CVR Committee, Parent and Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain U.S. federal and state income tax refunds for the two (2)
taxable years ending immediately before the taxable year that ends on and
includes the Closing Date and the taxable period that ends on and includes
the Closing Date solely as a result of the Asset Purchase Loss (determined on
a with and without basis), including filing IRS Forms 4466 and 1139, as
appropriate (and analogous state tax forms, as applicable) and any necessary
amended returns, responding promptly to questions from taxing authorities and
information requests; _provided_ that each of Parent, Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the CVR Committee shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, any information or assistance to the others as is reasonably
necessary for Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee
to comply with their respective obligations under this _Section 2.6_. In
addition, the CVR Committee shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, any Tax
Return on which a claim for a refund is made (a " _Refund Return_ "),
including any IRS Form 4466 or 1139, and any such Refund Return shall be
submitted to Parent for its approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Parent shall timely file
any such Refund Return but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
any such Refund Return has been so approved. Prior to any such filing, the
CVR Committee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any disputes with respect to any such Refund Returns;
_provided_ that in the event the CVR Committee, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are unable to resolve any such objections within fifteen (15)
days after such Refund Return is submitted to Parent, the CVR Committee,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, within one Business Day following
the end of such fifteen (15) day period, engage Deloitte and Touche LLP, or if
Deloitte and Touche is unable to serve, another nationally recognized accounting
firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such objections, and Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such objections within fifteen
(15) days following its engagement, which resolution shall be final and
binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the holders of the Contingent Value Rights).

 



8 (d) Following the Surviving Corporations (or any of its Affiliates) receipt
of any U.S. federal and state income tax refunds described in _Section
2.6(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days following such receipt, deposit (or cause to be
deposited) by wire transfer of immediately available funds the entire amount
of such refund, reduced by any increase in U.S. federal income tax liability
resulting from the Surviving Corporations receipt of any state income tax
refund (as reasonably determined by the Surviving Corporation on a with and
without basis) (any such refund, as so reduced, a " _Net Tax Refund_ ") with
the CVR Agent and shall give written notice of such receipt of deposit to the
CVR Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent, Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation be required to deposit or distribute any amounts
under this _Section 2.6_ unless and until the Surviving Corporation (or any
of its Affiliates) actually receives the related Net Tax Refund from the
applicable Governmental Entity. Following receipt of any such Net Tax Refund
by the CVR Agent, Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to promptly (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days) deposit with the Paying Agent an
amount equal to 30% of such Net Tax Refund, and Parent or Buyer shall direct
the Paying Agent to promptly disburse such funds to the holders of Contingent
Value Rights, with each Contingent Value Right entitling the holder thereof
to a payment equal to the quotient of (A) the product of (i) 30% multiplied by
(ii) the amount of the applicable Net Tax Refund _divided by_ (B) the number
of Contingent Value Rights then outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the
"number of Contingent Value Rights then outstanding" shall be deemed to
include, as of such payment date, (i) such number of Contingent Value Rights
that former holders of Company Common Stock who have not properly surrendered
their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be entitled
to receive upon such surrender and (ii) such number of Contingent Value
Rights that would have been issued to holders of Dissenting Shares in the
event that such holders shares of Company Common Stock had been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_, and the Paying Agent shall disburse to Parent such amount which
would otherwise have been paid in respect of the Contingent Value Rights
associated with such Dissenting Shares whenever any amounts are disbursed
hereunder to the holders of Contingent Value Rights. The remainder of such
Net Tax Refund shall be held by the CVR Agent in an interest bearing account
(the " _Tax Holdback Account_ ") pursuant to _Section 2.6(k)_ and disbursed
in accordance with the terms of this  _Section 2.6_. Any interest earned on
the amount in the Tax Holdback Account shall be for the benefit of the holders
of Contingent Value Rights, and Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to
transfer the interest then-accrued to date on any funds to be disbursed by
the CVR Agent from the Tax Holdback Account to the Paying Agent for payment to
the holders of Contingent Value Rights.

 

(e) In the event any U.S. federal income tax refund described in _Section
2.6(c)_ is approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Parent or Buyer shall
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
written notice of such approval) notify the CVR Agent and the CVR Committee,
and Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days after receipt from Parent or Buyer of written
notice of such approval) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to (i)
60% of the applicable Net Tax Refund plus (ii) any interest accrued to date
on the amount of such Net Tax Refund held in the Tax Holdback Account (clauses
(i) and (ii), as may be increased pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_, the " _JCT
Approval Payment_ "), and 

 



9  Parent or Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse such
funds to the holders of Contingent Value Rights, with each Contingent Value
Right entitling the holder thereof to a payment equal to the quotient of (A)
the amount of the JCT Approval Payment _divided by_ (B) the number of
Contingent Value Rights then outstanding. In the event any Net Tax Refund is
reduced as a result of a Determination, the amount set forth in clause (i)
above shall be instead the greater of (x) zero and (y) the amount of such Net
Tax Refund (as so reduced) less the amount previously paid with respect to
such Net Tax Refund pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_. 

(f) The first JCT Approval Payment shall be increased by an amount equal to
(x) 60% of the Net Tax Refund attributable to any tax refund previously
received that is a "quick refund" of the Companys estimated payments of U.S.
federal income taxes for the taxable year that includes and ends on the
Closing Date plus (y) any interest accrued to date on the amount of such Net
Tax Refund held in the Tax Holdback Account. In the event any such Net Tax
Refund is reduced as a result of a Determination, the amount set forth in
clause (x) above shall be instead the greater of (1) zero and (2) the amount
of such Net Tax Refund (as so reduced) less the amount previously paid with
respect to such Net Tax Refund pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_.

 

(g) Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to promptly deposit with the
Paying Agent, and give written notice of such deposit to the CVR Committee,
an amount equal to (i) the remaining amount of any Net Tax Refund plus (ii)
any interest accrued to date on the amount of such Net Tax Refund held in the
Tax Holdback Account (clauses (i) and (ii), as may be reduced pursuant to the
proviso below, the " _Remaining Refund Payment_ ") upon the earlier of: (x)
the expiration of the statute of limitations (without taking into account any
extensions or waivers thereof that were initiated by the Company unilaterally
and without consultation with the CVR Committee, and without application of
special statutes of limitations for substantial understatement, substantial
omission, fraud or similar circumstances) applicable to the IRSs review of
the Tax Return for the taxable year to which such Net Tax Refund relates and
(y) the time that the IRS closes its income tax audit of the Surviving
Corporation for the taxable year to which such Net Tax Refund relates (in
which case all remaining funds in the Tax Holdback Account related to such
Net Tax Refund shall be deposited with the Paying Agent). Parent or Buyer
shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse the Remaining Refund
Payment to the holders of Contingent Value Rights, with each Contingent Value
Right entitling the holder thereof to a payment equal to the quotient of (A)
the amount of the Remaining Refund Payment _divided by_ (B) the number of
Contingent Value Rights then outstanding. 

(h) In the event any Net Tax Refund is reduced as a result of a Determination,
Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to disburse to the Surviving
Corporation an amount equal to the cash tax owed (computed on a with and
without basis) as a result of such reduction, which disbursement shall reduce
the amount held in the Tax Holdback Account. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event of a Determination that does not reduce the amount of such Net Tax
Refund, no funds shall be disbursed to the Surviving Corporation from the Tax
Holdback Account. Furthermore, holders of Contingent Value Rights shall have
no obligation to return or forfeit any amounts paid pursuant to this _Section
2.6_ in the event that, after any such payment, there is a Determination that
adversely affects any of the Net Tax Refunds.

 



10 (i) Prior to the Closing, the Company will form a committee (comprised of one
individual reasonably acceptable to Parent) (the " _CVR Committee_ ") with
authority to monitor compliance with the foregoing and enforce, on behalf of
the holders of Contingent Value Rights, the obligations of Parent, Buyer and
the Company pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. The member of the CVR Committee
shall have the authority to determine and appoint any successor member to the
CVR Committee reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ that, prior to the
Closing, the Company will designate an alternate individual reasonably
acceptable to Parent to serve on the CVR Committee in the event of the death
or disability of the member of the CVR Committee or the resignation of such
member without designation of a successor. The CVR Committee shall be an
express third party beneficiary of the provisions of this _Section 2.6_ with
full authority on behalf of the holders of Contingent Value Rights to enforce
the provisions hereof and to settle, negotiate or compromise any claims
hereunder. Any decision, act or instruction of the CVR Committee with respect
to the matters set forth in this _Section 2.6_ shall be final, binding and
conclusive on all holders of Contingent Value Rights. The reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the CVR Committee, including
reasonable and documented fees for counsel and accountants and reasonable
compensation for service of the members of such committee as set forth on
_Section 2.6(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be paid by Parent,
and Parent shall indemnify each person who is or was a member of the CVR
Committee on the terms set forth in Section 2.6(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(j) Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) obtain the maximum amount of Net Tax Refunds reasonably
available and as reflected on the relevant Refund Return, (ii) cooperate with
audits, and challenge in good faith through appropriate administrative or
court proceedings any determination by a taxing authority or court adversely
affecting all or any portion of such refunds where, after consultation with
Parent, the CVR Committee has determined (after consultation with its
accounting advisors and outside counsel) that such challenge has a reasonable
possibility of success and (iii) provide the CVR Committee and its counsel
and accountants with reasonable access to the books and records of the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer and Parent relevant to the Net Tax Refunds,
including submissions to and reports or correspondence from the IRS. Parent,
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall keep the CVR Committee informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of the foregoing, including by promptly
informing the CVR Committee of all proceedings, material correspondence and
substantive meetings and discussions with the IRS; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not provide copies of any of its or its
Affiliates Tax Returns to the CVR Committee (other than the Refund Returns
or Tax Returns related solely to the Refund Returns). Parent, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall give the CVR Committee the opportunity to control
any such audit, dispute or Action, and Parent, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation or the CVR Committee, as applicable, shall not settle
or agree to settle any such audit, dispute or Action without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 

(k) The cash deposited with the CVR Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.6_
shall be invested by the CVR Agent as set forth on Section 2.6(k) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments that cause the Tax Holdback Account to diminish below the
level required to make cash payments to the holders of Contingent Value
Rights as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_, Parent or Buyer shall have no

 



11  obligation to replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, such
portion of the funds in the Tax Holdback Account (or any obligation to replace
or restore any interest or other income from any investment of the Net Tax
Refunds in the Tax Holdback Account). Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part of the Tax Holdback Account. The
funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this  _Section 2.6_ shall
not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_.

(l) The Contingent Value Rights may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged or encumbered in any manner, other than transfers by will or
intestacy, by inter vivos or testamentary trust where the Contingent Value
Right is to be passed to the beneficiaries upon the death of the trustee,
pursuant to a court order, by operation of law, or in connection with the
dissolution, liquidation or termination of a corporation, limited liability
company, partnership or other entity which is the holder thereof.

 

(m) The CVR Agent shall keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
purpose of registering Contingent Value Rights and transfers of Contingent
Value Rights as herein provided. The CVR Register shall show one position for
Cede and Co representing all the shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Depositary Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") on behalf of the street name holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holders as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and any payments to be made under this _Section
2.6_ to any street holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
accomplished by the Paying Agent sending one lump payment to DTC. Neither
Parent, Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the
CVR Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the distribution of payments by
DTC to such street name holders. In the case of any other former holder of
record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Company Restricted Stock or
Company Options, the Contingent Value Rights shall be registered in the name
and address of such former holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options as such names and
addresses are provided to Parent by or on behalf of the Company prior to the
Closing.

(n) A holder of a Contingent Value Right may make a written request to the CVR
Agent to change such holders address of record in the CVR Register. The
written request must be duly executed by the holder. Subject to any reasonable
procedures imposed by the CVR Agent, the CVR Agent shall promptly record the
change of address in the CVR Register upon receipt of such written notice.

(o) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _Section
2.6(l)_, every request made to transfer a Contingent Value Right must be in
writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent or Buyer, the CVR Committee and the CVR Agent, duly
executed by the holder thereof, his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
writing, personal representative or survivor and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the CVR Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination
that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise
complies with the other terms and conditions herein, register the transfer of
the Contingent Value Rights in the CVR Register. Parent, Buyer and the CVR
Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax
or governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer. No transfer of a Contingent Value Right shall be
valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any transfer not duly
registered in the CVR Register will be void _ab initio_.

 



12 (p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the holder of a
Contingent Value Right may at any time at its option abandon all of its
remaining rights in a Contingent Value Right by written notice to the CVR
Agent and Buyer or by transfer of such Contingent Value Right to Buyer without
consideration therefor. Nothing in this  _Section 2.6_ is intended to
prohibit Parent or Buyer from offering to acquire Contingent Value Rights for
consideration in its sole discretion.

 

2.7 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, the CVR Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local
or non-U.S. tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and paid over to
the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person, in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

2.8 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the
event that the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities

Investment Advisory Agreement and all other Contracts pursuant to which the
Company and its Subsidiaries provide investment advisory, investment sub-
advisory, collateral management or similar services to the Client, (ii) the
Client Consent required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the parties from whom such Client Consent must be

accordance with applicable Law and applicable Fund Documentation or Contracts)
and (iii) the Assets Under Management and Run Rate Revenue for such Client as
of the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the
date of this Agreement (or the last practicable date prior to such date for
which Assets Under Management for any such Client is available as indicated
therein) (such date, the " _Base Date_ "; and such Run Rate Revenue, which
shall exclude any Client that Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
indicates is to be excluded, the " _Base Date Run Rate Revenue_ "). Other
than the Persons listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
acting as managing member of a Subsidiary that is a limited liability company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries acts as investment adviser,
investment sub-adviser, collateral manager, general partner, managing member,
manager or administrator to, or receives fees from, any other Person.

 

For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Assets Under Management_ " means, with respect to any Client, as of a
specified date, the dollar amount of assets under management in respect of
which the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to investment advisory and
investment management fees from such Client as of such date; provided,
however, that the calculation of Assets Under Management shall exclude any
increase or decrease in Assets Under Management resulting from market
appreciation or depreciation or currency fluctuations from and after the Base
Date.

 



23 (ii) " _Run Rate Revenue_ " means, with respect to any Client, as of a
specified date, the aggregate annualized investment advisory and investment
management fees payable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, determined by
multiplying the Assets Under Management for such Client as of such specified
date (or the last practicable date prior to such specified date for which
Assets Under Management for any such Client is available) by the applicable
annual base fee rate for such Client under the applicable Investment Advisory
Agreement at such specified date (not including any performance-based,
incentive or similar fees), after taking into account any fee rebates or fee
sharing arrangements. Run Rate Revenue shall be calculated to exclude any
Client indicated on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter to be
excluded from such calculation.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of the material Fund Documentation of each Company Fund.

(c) Each Company Fund has been duly organized and is validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate, partnership, limited liability company, or similar
power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each Company Fund is duly qualified, licensed or
registered to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where it
is required to do so under applicable Law except for such failures to be so
qualified, licensed or registered that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) All shares or other ownership interests in each of the Company Funds were
sold in accordance with, in all material respects, applicable securities Law
and their respective Fund Documentation and have been duly authorized and are
validly issued and (if applicable) fully-paid and non-assessable.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, based on the representations from each
Person that is, or that holds an interest in, a Client no portion of the
assets of any such Client constitutes the assets of a "benefit plan investor"
within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101(f) (as modified by Section 3(42) of Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "). No "bad actor"

Company, there have been no material errors or omissions in any financial
report delivered or made available by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to the investors therein (the " _Fund Reports_ ") pursuant to the applicable
Fund Documentation. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no material

Contract or released any Company Fund, in whole or in part, from any of its
obligations under the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement. No material
breach and no default or event of default has occurred or is continuing under
any Investment Advisory Agreement or related Fund Documentation, no event
or condition exists that would constitute cause to remove the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as collateral manager or in any other capacity, and no
holder of the Company Funds outstanding securities is soliciting votes or
requests for direction, or has threatened in writing to remove the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as collateral manager or in any other capacity. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any prior assignment of rights or
obligations under any of their Investment Advisory Agreements or applicable

14d-2 of the Exchange Act) thereof (or if the Company Stockholders Meeting is
to occur earlier than the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) or (v) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the
foregoing in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ ").

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 5.5_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (and/or
the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change in Company
Recommendation with respect to a Superior Proposal) if and only if:

 

(i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(including an Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party) that was not
solicited in breach of this _Section 5.5_ that the Companys Board of
Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company
has materially complied with the other provisions of this Section 5.5 with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

 



52 (ii) the Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith that
the failure to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_
and/or make such Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(iii) the Company delivers to Parent and the Asset Buyer a written notice (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent and the Asset Buyer that the
Companys Board of Directors proposes to take such action and containing a
copy of the proposed agreement in respect of the Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action of the Board of Directors of the Company,
including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal;

(iv) until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Superior
Proposal Notice (the " _Notice Period_ "), if requested by Parent and the
Asset Buyer, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, engage
in good faith negotiations with Parent, Asset Buyer and their respective
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement and related agreements so
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that any revision or amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed
to constitute a new Superior Proposal and shall require a new Superior
Proposal Notice, except that the Notice Period with respect to such Superior
Proposal will become three (3) Business Days instead of five (5) Business
Days); and

(v) following the end of the Notice Period(s) referred to above, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (a) after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account any
modifications to this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement proposed by
Parent and the Asset Buyer prior to such time, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (b) after consultation with
its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.5_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company or its Board of Directors may make a Change in Company Recommendation
other than in response to or in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or a
Superior Proposal if and only if:

 

(i) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a
result of any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence relating to
or affecting the Company or its 

 



53  Subsidiaries, including the business, operations, assets or liabilities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and which was not known by or reasonably
foreseeable to the Companys Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) as
of the date of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any action taken by the Company in order to
comply with the covenants set forth in this Agreement or the Asset Purchase
Agreement, and the consequences of any such action, constitute an Intervening
Event;

 

(ii) the Company delivers to Parent and the Asset Buyer a written notice (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising Parent and the Asset Buyer that the
Companys Board of Directors proposes to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, which notice shall include a description of the applicable
Intervening Event;

 

(iii) until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Intervening
Event Notice, if requested by Parent and the Asset Buyer, the Company will,
and will cause its Representatives to, engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent, the Asset Buyer and their respective Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Asset
Purchase Agreement so that the need for making such Change in Company
Recommendation would be obviated; and

(iv) following such time referred to in clause (iii) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel, and taking into account any modifications to this Agreement
and the Asset Purchase Agreement proposed by Parent and the Asset Buyer prior
to such time) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

In the event that the Company delivers Parent a Superior Proposal Notice or
an Intervening Event Notice, the Company shall have been deemed to have
automatically waived any standstill to which Parent or any of its Affiliates
is a party solely for the limited purpose of permitting Parent, Buyer and
Merger Sub to negotiate with the Company in accordance with the terms of
clause (g) or (h) above, as applicable.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making a customary
"stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company) or (iii) making any legally
required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), the Company expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Recommendation in such disclosure and does not include any
statement that itself would be a Change in Company Recommendation.

 



54 (j) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or until this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to,
and shall not assist or facilitate Asset Buyer or any of its Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate discussions or engage in
negotiations with, or provide information to, the Asset Buyer with respect to
any potential sale of or transaction involving the Company other than the
transactions with Parent contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than a joint offer from Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Asset
Buyer) with respect to (x) the acquisition in any manner, directly or
indirectly (including by way of tender offer or exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, sale of equity interests, share exchange, business combination
or otherwise) of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(or of securities representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the total
voting power of the Company) or (y) the acquisition (directly or indirectly
and whether by transfer, merger, consolidation, equity investment or
otherwise) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets
(including stock of the Companys Subsidiaries) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person from whom the Company or any of its
Representatives has received a written Acquisition Proposal after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, which
written Acquisition Proposal the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith prior to the start of the No-Shop Period Start Date
(after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) is or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Person shall immediately cease to be an Excluded Party if
(A) such Acquisition Proposal made by such Person prior to the start of the
No-Shop Period Start Date is withdrawn (it being understood that any
amendment, modification or replacement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not,
in and of itself, be deemed a withdrawal of such Acquisition Proposal) or (B)
such Acquisition Proposal, in the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside counsel and its
financial advisor), no longer is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except that, for the purpose of this definition of Superior Proposal, all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty percent (20%)
or more" will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more")
which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, is reasonably
likely to be consummated and would result, if consummated, in a transaction
that is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably
offered in writing by Parent and the Asset Buyer in response to such Superior
Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 5.5(g)_).

 



55 5.6 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans._

 

(a) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2018, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to those employees who are, as of the Effective
Time, employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries and remain so employed (the
" _Continuing Employees_ ") annual base salary and base wages, and cash
incentive compensation opportunities, that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to such annual base salary and base wages, and cash incentive
compensation opportunities provided to the Company Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall entitle Continuing Employees to participate in
any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent
(collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") as similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining cash
incentive compensation opportunities for the calendar year ending December 31,
2018 to be provided to Continuing Employees, such amounts will be no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those earned by the Company Employees prior
to the Effective Time for the calendar year ending December 31, 2017,
regardless of when any such amounts are paid.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries to, (i) give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Parent Plans, for such
Continuing Employees service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the
Company and its Subsidiaries under similar Plans, (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, and (iii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage
period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would
result in the duplication of benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the cash incentive awards applicable to any Continuing Employee for
calendar year 2017 (as to each Continuing Employee, a " _2017 Bonus_ "), if
the Closing occurs (x) during the 2017 calendar year, the Company shall pay at
Closing (fully in cash) to each Continuing Employee, the 2017 Bonus set forth
on Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case prorated
(except as set forth on Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter) to
reflect the portion of the year elapsed between January 1, 2017 and the
Closing Date and (y) during the 2018 calendar year, but prior to the payment
of the 2017 Bonus to the Continuing Employees, the Company shall pay at
Closing (fully in cash) to each Continuing Employee, an amount equal to such
Continuing Employees 2017 Bonus set forth on Section 3.14(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



56 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing
does not occur during the 2017 calendar year, the Company shall be permitted
to establish the terms and conditions of the cash incentive awards applicable
to Continuing Employees for calendar year 2018 (the " _2018 Bonus_ ") in
consultation with Parent and subject to Parents written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to any
approval, implementation, communication or disclosure with respect to the 2018
Bonus.

 

(e) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.6(a)_ and _Section 5.6(b)_
above, in the event that a Continuing Employees employment with the
Surviving Corporation (or such other controlled Affiliate of Parent following
the Closing that such Continuing Employee is employed by) is terminated by the
Surviving Corporation (or such other controlled Affiliate of Parent following
the Closing that such Continuing Employee is employed by) other than for cause
(as reasonably determined by the Surviving Corporation or applicable
controlled Affiliate of Parent) within the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the Closing Date, such terminated Continuing Employee
shall receive severance benefits no less favorable than those set forth on
Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Any such severance shall be
subject to the terminated Continuing Employees signing a separation
agreement containing a general release of claims in a form and manner
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation or applicable controlled Affiliate
of Parent. The provisions of this Section 5.6(e) shall not apply to any
Continuing Employee who, in the event of such termination, is eligible for
severance under any other then applicable agreement (including any employment,
severance or change of control agreement). In no event shall this Section
5.6(e) result in a duplication of severance pay or benefits for any Continuing
Employee.

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide for the
termination of the Companys 2016 Co-Investment Plan, such that all awards
issued thereunder shall be terminated and cashed out in accordance with their
terms, at or before the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each holder
of an award under the Companys 2016 Co-Investment Plan shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive payment
therefor, if any.

 

(g) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plans(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(h) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former
employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of any of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on
or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries), other than the parties and 

 



57  their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this
_Section 5.6_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in the Agreement shall
be construed to prevent, from and after the Effective Time, the termination of
employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.6(a)_, any change in the employee benefits available
to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular
Plan in accordance with its terms.

 

5.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers and Other Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable
Law, each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
awards paid in settlement or incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the fact
that such Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
Action, including any expenses incurred in enforcing such Persons rights
under this _Section 5.7_; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_.

 

(b) The provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation
and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less
favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions contained in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the
date hereof, which provisions shall not, except to the extent required by
applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase from
insurance carriers, following reasonable consultation with Parent, six (6)
year prepaid "tail policies" for directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance providing at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are at least as advantageous
to the insureds as the current policies maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from actual or alleged acts,
errors or omissions that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policies"
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not pay more than
250% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
Effective Time in respect of each 

 



58  such policy described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.7(d)_, but
in case such coverage is not available for such amount, the Company shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In
addition, if requested by and with the consultation and consent of Parent,
prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase prepaid "tail
policies" with respect to claims arising from actual or alleged acts, errors
or omissions that occurred at or before the Effective Time for (i) employment
practices liability insurance; (ii) "cyber" and data security liability
insurance; and/or (iii) professional/errors and omissions liability
insurance, including any "claims-made" fidelity bond, surety bond or similar
coverage.

(d) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform
under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with any
director or officer prior to the date hereof and that are set forth on Section
5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.7_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

 

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.7_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable
governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers,
directors and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided
for in this  _Section 5.7_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

5.8 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the
other party of any change or event of which it becomes aware which it believes
would or would be reasonably likely to prevent the satisfaction of any
condition to closing set forth in _Article VI_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that any noncompliance with this _Section 5.8_ shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ or
_Section 6.3(b)_ has been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination
under _Article VII_.

5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



59 5.10 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
(other than in the case of the Company, a Change in Company Recommendation and
related public statements or any other statements contemplated by _Section
5.5(i)_) without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press
release or make such public statement as may, upon the advice of outside
counsel, be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable
securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be a joint press release in
the form agreed to by the Company, Parent and Asset Buyer.

5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any Transaction Litigation
is brought, or threatened to be brought, against the Company or any members
of its Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any
such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof, including by promptly informing Parent of all
proceedings and correspondence relating to such Transaction Litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of
any Transaction Litigation, including the right to review and comment on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection
therewith and the right to provide advice with respect to the Transaction
Litigation as to which the Company shall give due consideration. The Company
shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.12 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after (and only
after) the Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Asset Purchase Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of
their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take all
actions as are necessary so that such transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such
Takeover Statute on such transactions. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or under the
Asset Purchase Agreement.

 



60 5.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

5.15 _Client Consents_.

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Client
Consents; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to offer or grant any material accommodation or material
alteration of terms (financial or otherwise) to obtain such required Consents.

 

(b) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
obtaining the Client Consents and shall, prior to the Closing, make available
to Parent copies of all such executed Client Consents and, upon reasonable
prior notice from Parent, make available for Parents inspection the originals
of such Client Consents and any related materials and other records relating
to such consent process. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with
obtaining the Client Consents, the Company shall obtain Parents approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed)
of the form and substance of any notice or other materials to be distributed
to the Client or other Persons in order to obtain the necessary Client
Consent.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice that any Client (i) has
ceased or will cease to use any services of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) has substantially reduced, or will substantially reduce,
the use of services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii)
has sought, or is seeking, to reduce any fees it will pay for any services of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.16 _Asset Purchase Agreement_. The Company shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to comply with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, (ii)
not amend, modify or supplement the Asset Purchase Agreement or consent to any
amendment or modification of or supplement to the Asset Purchase Agreement or
waive any of its rights thereunder and (iii) not terminate the Asset Purchase
Agreement under provisions requiring mutual consent of the Company and the
Asset Buyer. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement, including by (A) providing Parent a copy of all notices received by
the Company from the Asset Buyer or provided by the Company to the Asset
Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement and (B) notifying the Company as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within one Business Day) upon
becoming aware of any event that has given rise to, or that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, a right of termination by either
party under the Asset Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub shall be responsible for any actions or inactions
of Asset Buyer. Notwithstanding any term of the Asset Purchase Agreement, (a)
if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted to take an action under
the Asset Purchase Agreement but is prohibited from taking (or otherwise
restricted in taking) such action under this Agreement, the Company shall not
take such action (or shall otherwise comply with the restrictions in respect
of such action) and (b) if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted
not to take an action under the Asset Purchase Agreement but it is required
to take such action under this Agreement, the Company shall (or shall cause
its Subsidiary to) take such action.

 



61 5.17 _Fund Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the occurrence of any event
described in _Section 3.11(m)_ or _(n)_ and shall make available to Parent
any Trustees or other report from a Company Fund or a service provider to a
Company Fund that is provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
investors in any Company Fund after the date of this Agreement.

optional redemption of the outstanding notes, under such indenture.

 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell or cause to be
sold before the Closing all of the Loans Held for Sale to the Company Funds,
in each case to the "target portfolio" indicated in Section 5.17(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Each sale of Loans Held for Sale shall be effected
on arms length terms (including pursuant to the terms of any Collateral
Management Agreement or other applicable Contract then in effect), for cash
and otherwise in a manner consistent with past practice. From and after the
date of this Agreement, the Company will provide to Parent on a weekly basis a
written report showing all sales of Loans Held for Sale since the date of
this Agreement and since the date of any prior report, and identifying in each
case the buyer of the loan and the sale price.

 

(d) Upon Parents reasonable request, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents efforts to
arrange for financing of the Dartmouth Assets.

(e) The Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries to take all necessary
action so that before the Effective Time all Excluded Assets are owned solely

Effective Time:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if

issued a final non-appealable Order or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if
the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April 16, 2018 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

terminate if any action of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub)
or the failure of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed
at or prior to the Effective Time has been the primary cause of the failure
of the Effective Time to occur on or before the End Date;

 



64 (d) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, (
_provided_ that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party contained
herein) if the other party shall have breached any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements made by such other party herein, and such
breach (i) is not cured within twenty (20) Business Days (or, if earlier, two
(2) Business Days prior to the End Date) following written notice to the party
committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the End Date and (ii) would entitle the non-breaching party not to

Agreement, (ii) this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive any

this _Section 7.2_, a " _willful and material breach_ " shall mean a material
breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken by the
breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to
act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement.

 



65 (b) The Company shall pay Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to $3 million (the " _Go Shop
Termination Fee_ ") if (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a
Superior Proposal with an Excluded Party; _provided_ that the initial
Superior Proposal Notice with respect to such Excluded Party has been validly
delivered to Parent and Asset Buyer no later than the date that is fourteen
(14) days after the No-Shop Period Start Date or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated under _Section 7.1(h)_ after the Asset Purchase Agreement has been
terminated under Section 7.1(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement in a
circumstance in which a Go Shop Termination Fee (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) was payable to the Asset Buyer under Section 7.2(c)
therein; _provided further_ that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the
payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee shall be made concurrently with or
prior to such termination of this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall pay Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to $4.5 million (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_, which payment shall be made within two (2) Business Days
of the date of such termination, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ in a circumstance in which the Go Shop
Termination Fee is not payable or (iii) this Agreement is terminated under
_Section 7.1(h)_ after the Asset Purchase Agreement has been terminated under
Section 7.1(f) or Section 7.1(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement in a
circumstance in which the Termination Fee (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement) was payable to Asset Buyer under Section 7.2(d) therein; provided
that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the payment of the Termination Fee
shall be made concurrently with or prior to such termination of
this Agreement.

(d) If (1) this Agreement is terminated by (A) either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, (B) by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(c)_, (C) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_ if and only if the Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated (x) by the
Company or the Asset Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(e)
therein or (y) by the Asset Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(d) therein, or (D)
by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, and (2) (x) an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made to the Company (but not publicly announced) and such
Acquisition Proposal has not been unconditionally withdrawn prior to the
termination of this Agreement or (y) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the termination of this Agreement and (3) within twelve (12) months after such
termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall pay Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Termination Fee on or before the second Business Day
after the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated. For purposes of this
_Section 7.2(d)_, all references to "20% or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall instead refer to "50% or more".

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay both the Go Shop Termination Fee and the Termination Fee, it
being understood and agreed that only one payment of either the Go Shop
Termination Fee or the Termination Fee shall ever be payable hereunder. The
Company, Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub agree that the agreements contained in 
_Section 7.2_ are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this

 



66  Agreement and that neither the Go Shop Termination Fee nor the Termination
Fee shall constitute a penalty but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. If, in order to obtain such payment of the Go Shop
Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, Parent commences a suit against
the Company that results in a judgment for the payment of the Go Shop
Termination Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, the Company shall also be
required to pay to Parent interest on the termination fee that was so payable
at the annual rate equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, through
the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law (" _Interest Expense_ ").

(f) Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Go Shop Termination Fee or
Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable by the Company pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_, Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any
remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise other than
payment by the Company to Parent of such Go Shop Termination Fee or
Termination Fee if and when payable hereunder (and Interest Expense, if
applicable), and none of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub shall seek to obtain
any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, other
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the Asset Purchase Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby).

Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision
of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all
cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith in an effort to agree upon a valid and enforceable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

 

8.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent

administrators and his or her representatives following the Effective Time,
this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of

this Agreement and seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further agrees not to
assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties hereby
waives any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate. Each of the parties hereby
waive any requirement for the other party to post any bond or other security
as a condition to institute any proceeding for specific performance, an

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.

NewStar Financial, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware since its original incorporation date of May 27,
2004 (the "Corporation") under the name "Novus Capital, Inc.," pursuant to
Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL"), hereby certifies as follows:



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
     _FIRST_ : |  | The name of the Corporation is NewStar Financial,
Inc. 
   | 
   _SECOND_ : |  | The Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, 19801, and the name of its registered agent at such address is: The
Corporation Trust Company. 
   | 
   _THIRD_ : |  | The purpose of the Corporation is to carry on any and
all business and to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the DGCL. 
   | 
   _FOURTH_ : |  | The total number of shares of stock which this
Corporation is authorized to issue is: 
   | 
   |  | One Hundred (100) shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per
share. 
   | 
   _FIFTH_ : |  | In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation
(the "By-laws"). 
   | 
   _SIXTH_ : |  | Elections of directors need not be by written ballot
unless the By-laws shall so provide. 
   | 
   _SEVENTH_ : |  | 
   | 
   A. |  | _Limitations on Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which
the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended
after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation to further
eliminate or limit the liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal
liability provided herein, shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL. No amendment, modification or repeal of this
Article SEVENTH shall adversely affect the rights and protection afforded to
a director of the Corporation under this Article SEVENTH for acts or omissions
occurring prior to such amendment, modification or repeal. who is or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or, while serving as such director or officer, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including, without limitation, service with respect to employee
benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith if the person
acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the
persons conduct was unlawful, and such indemnification shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall
inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and administrators;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in the second paragraph of
this Part B, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this section
shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation for any expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the DGCL
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in
his or her capacity as a director or officer in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or
otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. 
---|---|--- 

If a claim under the first paragraph of this Part B is not paid in full by
the Corporation within twenty (20) days after such claim has been received in
writing by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have ---|---|--- 
     |  | made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. 
   | 
   |  | The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in this Part B shall not be exclusive of, and the Corporation is
authorized to honor or provide, any other right that any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, which other right may provide indemnification and
advancement in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise
permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, subject only to limits created by
applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions
for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others. 
   | 
   C. |  | _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability
or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 
   | 
   D. |  | _Repeal and Modification_. Any repeal or
modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 
   | 
   _EIGHTH_ : |  | The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and
from time to time, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained
in this Certificate of Incorporation, and to add or insert other provisions
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any
other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation
in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights
reserved in this Article EIGHTH. 
 

_The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank_ IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has
been subscribed this  _ _ day of _ _, _ _ by the undersigned
who affirms that the statements made herein are true and correct.

AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS

 

of

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.

(the "Corporation")

 

1\. Stockholders

(a) _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for
the election of directors each year at such place, date and time as shall be
designated by the Board of Directors. Any other proper business may be
transacted at the annual meeting. If no date for the annual meeting is
established or said meeting is not held on the date established as provided
above, a special meeting in lieu thereof may be held or there may be action by
written consent of the stockholders on matters to be voted on at the annual
meeting, and such special meeting or written consent shall have for the
purposes of these By-laws or otherwise all the force and effect of an annual
meeting.

 

(b) _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by the
Chief Executive Officer, if one is elected, or, if there is no Chief
Executive Officer, a President, or by the Board of Directors, but such special
meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. The call for the
meeting shall state the place, date, hour and purposes of the meeting. Only
the purposes specified in the notice of special meeting shall be considered
or dealt with at such special meeting.

(c) _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take any action at a meeting, a notice stating the place, if any, date and
hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such
meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the
meeting, shall be given by the Secretary (or other person authorized by these
By-laws or by law) not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
before the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat and to each
stockholder who, under the Certificate of Incorporation or under these By-
laws is entitled to such notice. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in
the mail, postage prepaid, directed to such stockholder at such stockholders
address as it appears in the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be effectively given to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner
provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

If a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, except that if
the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment
a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting. (d) _Quorum_. The holders of a majority in interest of all stock issued,
outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned
from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question,
whether or not a quorum is present. The stockholders present at a duly
constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to reduce the voting
shares below a quorum.

 

(e) _Voting and Proxies_. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by law, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by either
written proxy or by a transmission permitted by Section 212(c) of the DGCL,
but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period or is irrevocable and coupled
with an interest. Proxies shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting, or
of any adjournment thereof. Except as otherwise limited therein, proxies
shall entitle the persons authorized thereby to vote at any adjournment of
such meeting.

(f) _Action at Meeting_. When a quorum is present, any matter before the
meeting shall be decided by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
stock voting on such matter except where a larger vote is required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws. Any election of
directors by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes
cast, except where a larger vote is required by law, by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these By-laws. The Corporation shall not directly or
indirectly vote any share of its own stock; provided, however, that the
Corporation may vote shares which it holds in a fiduciary capacity to the
extent permitted by law.

(g) _Presiding Officer_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, or in his or her absence, the
Vice Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, or if neither is elected or in

setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to

mail, return receipt requested, or to the Corporations principal place of
business or to the officer of the Corporation having custody of the minute

taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing.

the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section 1(j) shall require the
Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact
information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least
ten (10) days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. The list
shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time
of the meeting as provided by law.

may participate in meetings of the Board of Directors by means of conference
telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all directors
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a

quorum is present, unless otherwise provided in the following sentence, a
majority of the directors present may take any action on behalf of the Board
of Directors, unless a larger number is required by law, by the Certificate of

Directors, any action to be taken by the Board of Directors shall require the
approval of all Directors. (j) _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board of Directors consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or

Directors. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in
paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in
electronic form.

 

(k) _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a
majority of the whole Board of Directors, establish one or more committees,
each committee to consist of one or more directors. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.
In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the
place of any such absent or disqualified member.

may make rules for the conduct of its business, but in the absence of such
rules its business shall be conducted so far as possible in the same manner as
is provided in these By-laws for the Board of Directors. All members of such
committees shall hold their committee offices at the pleasure of the Board of
Directors, and the Board may abolish any committee at any time.

affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as the
Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. (c) _Record Holders_. Except as may otherwise be required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws, the Corporation shall be
entitled to treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the
owner of such stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and
the right to vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or
other disposition of such stock, until the shares have been transferred on the
books of the Corporation in accordance with the requirements of these By-laws.

It shall be the duty of each stockholder to notify the Corporation of such
stockholders post office address.

stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a
record date, which shall not precede the date on which it is established, and
which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before
the date of such meeting, more than ten (10) days after the date on which the
record date for stockholder consent without a meeting is established, nor more
than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. In such case only
stockholders of record on such record date shall be so entitled
notwithstanding any transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation after
the record date.

 

If no record date is fixed, (i) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held, (ii) the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to
its registered office in this state, to its principal place of business, or to
an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, and (iii) the record
date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close
of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock
in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of
the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction
of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. 5\. Indemnification

 

(a) The Corporation shall have power to indemnify its directors, executive
officers, other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the

may be executed on behalf of the Corporation by, a President, or by any other
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may
authorize.

(d) _Voting of Securities_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides,
a President, any Vice President or the Treasurer or the Secretary may waive
notice of and act on behalf of this Corporation, or appoint another person or

stockholders or shareholders of any other corporation or organization, any of
whose securities are held by this Corporation.

whom legal process may be served in any action or proceeding against the
Corporation.

Incorporation, By-laws and records of all meetings of the incorporators,
stockholders and the Board of Directors and the stock and transfer records,
which shall contain the names of all stockholders, their record addresses and
the amount of stock held by each, shall be kept at the principal office of
the Corporation, at the office of its counsel, or at an office of its transfer
agent.

 

(g) _Certificate of Incorporation_. All references in these By-laws to the
Certificate of Incorporation shall be deemed to refer to the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and in effect from time to time.

 

(h) _Amendments_. The By-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation
may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or
repeal the By-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power,
nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal By-laws. (i) _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever notice is required to be given under any
provision of these By-laws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled
to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to
be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning
of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any meeting needs to be specified in any written waiver or any
waiver by electronic transmission.

 

(j) _Forum for Adjudication of Disputes_. Unless the Corporation consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
corporations stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant

the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 6(j).
