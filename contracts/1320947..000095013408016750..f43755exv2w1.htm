of the United States). Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed
identical in terms to the covenant contained in the preceding subsections of this <U>Section
4.02</U>. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate
covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in those subsections, then such unenforceable
covenant (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those
proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions
thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;4.02</U> should ever

remedy in the event of a breach by any Restricted Party of any of the covenants of such Restricted
Party, in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.02</U>, and that any such breach may cause Buyer irreparable injury

security, to injunctive and other such equitable relief in the event of a breach of any of said

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, either party may seek injunctive relief in a court
of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm from occurring prior to the selection of the
arbitrator. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the arbitration in good faith.
The provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;9.06</U> may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction,
