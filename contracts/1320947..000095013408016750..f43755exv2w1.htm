ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), entered into as of August 13, 2008, is made by and between General Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), and Diamond Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "). Seller and Buyer are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the " _Parties_ " and individually as a " _Party_." 

  

 WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell, and Buyer desires to buy, certain assets of Seller related to the manufacturing (through third parties), producing (through third parties), marketing, selling and distribution of microwave popcorn under the brand name "Pop Secret," (the " _Business_ "), and Buyer is willing to assume certain specified liabilities of Seller, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties, and covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I. PURCHASE AND SALE 

   

 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Assets._  

  

 (a) _Purchased Assets_. At the Closing and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller agrees to convey and sell, or cause its wholly-owned subsidiaries to convey and sell, to Buyer, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and Buyer agrees to buy from Seller, all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to (i) the specified assets which are set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)_ to this Agreement and (ii) the Pre-Paid Assets to be purchased by Buyer from Seller pursuant to _Section 6.03(c)_ (collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_ "). 

   

 (b) _Excluded Assets_. All assets of Seller not specifically set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)_ hereof shall be retained by Seller and are not being acquired by Buyer (the " _Excluded Assets_ "), including, but not limited to, those Excluded Assets which are set forth on _Schedule 1.01(b)_ to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Assumed Liabilities_. Buyer shall assume, and agree to pay, perform and discharge when due, the liabilities and obligations of Seller which are set forth on _Schedule 1.01(c)_ to this Agreement (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "). 

   

 (d) _Excluded Liabilities_. Buyer is not assuming, and shall not be deemed to have assumed, any liability or obligation of Seller which is not set forth on _Schedule 1.01(c)_ to this Agreement as an Assumed Liability (the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "), including, but not limited to, the Excluded Liabilities which are set forth on _Schedule 1.01(d)_ to this Agreement. 

   

 1.02 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer to Seller shall equal one hundred ninety million United States Dollars ($190,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to the Adjustment as set forth in _Section 1.04_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 

   ##### 

  

    

in this Agreement, the Purchase Price shall not include any Pre-Paid Amounts
to be paid from Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.03(c)_. 

  

 1.03 _The Closing_. 

  

 (a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Dorsey and Whitney LLP at 50 South Sixth Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota, upon the later of (i) five (5) business days after the date on which the conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ have been satisfied or (ii) at such other time or place as may be agreed to by Seller and Buyer. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. CST on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (b) At the Closing, the Parties shall deliver to each other the documents required to be delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof. 

   

 1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Following the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted, if at all, as set forth below: 

  

 (a) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, within 45 days after the Closing Date, a statement of the Inventory Amount (as defined in _Section 1.05(a)_) as of the Effective Time (the " _Inventory Statement_ ") which shall set forth an adjustment amount determined by calculating (i) the Inventory Amount and (ii) the difference between the Inventory Amount and $9,000,000 (the " _Target Inventory Amount_ ") (such difference (whether positive or negative) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Adjustment_ "). The Inventory Statement, the Inventory Amount and the Adjustment shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth on _Schedule 1.04_ hereto. During the 45-day period following such initial 45-day period, Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access to its books and records related to the Business, including records indicating the age of the finished goods inventory, to the extent necessary for Buyer to evaluate the Inventory Statement to determine whether to deliver an Objection Notice. Seller shall give Buyer five (5) business days notice before any physical count of the inventory, which physical count will occur on the Closing Date and at the locations identified on Schedule 1.04 hereto, underlying the Inventory Statement, and Buyer and its outside auditors shall have the right to be present at such physical count of the inventory. 

   

 (b) On or prior to the 45th day following Sellers delivery of the Inventory Statement, Buyer may give Seller a written notice stating in reasonable detail Buyers objections (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the calculation of the Adjustment. Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis therefor. If Buyer does not give Seller an Objection Notice within such 45-day period, then the Inventory Statement will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and the Adjustment will be final and binding upon the Parties for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Following Sellers receipt of any Objection Notice, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable. In the event that such negotiations result in a resolution of the dispute, Seller and Buyer shall agree in writing to an Adjustment that shall be binding as to all Parties. In the event that Seller and Buyer fail to agree 

  ##### 

  

    

 on any of Buyers proposed adjustments set forth in the Objection Notice
within 30 days after Sellers receipt of the Objection Notice (or such longer
period as Seller and Buyer may mutually agree in writing), Seller and Buyer
agree that a mutually acceptable accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing (the " _Independent Auditors_ ") shall, within the 30-day period
immediately following referral of the Inventory Statement and Objection
Notice to the Independent Auditors, make the final determination of the
Adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller and Buyer
each shall provide the Independent Auditors with their respective
determinations of the Adjustment and the Independent Auditors shall only
review and rely upon those items set forth in the Objection Notice and any
responses by Seller to such Objection Notice. The Independent Auditors shall
make an independent determination of only those items set forth in
the Objection Notice and not resolved by the mutual agreement of the Parties.
Based on such determination, the Independent Auditors shall determine the
resulting Adjustment that shall be final and binding on Seller and Buyer;
_provided_ that such independent determination shall be within the range
created by Sellers and Buyers proposals set forth in the Adjustment and the
Objection Notice. If the Independent Auditors determination of any
Adjustment is outside of the range proposed by Seller and Buyer in the
Inventory Statement and the Objection Notice, then the Party whose proposed
Adjustment was closer to that of the Independent Auditors shall be final and
binding on Seller and Buyer. 

   

 (d) Promptly after the Inventory Statement and the Adjustment are finally determined and become final and binding on the Parties under this _Section 1.04_, Seller or the Independent Auditors (if applicable) shall recalculate the Purchase Price by adding such final and binding determination of the Adjustment (which for the avoidance of doubt may be positive or negative) to the Purchase Price (the result of such recalculation being referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price (i.e., because the Adjustment was positive) by an amount greater than $200,000, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, within seven (7) business days following the Settlement Date, an amount equal to the full amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price (i.e., because the Adjustment was negative) by an amount greater than $200,000, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, within seven (7) business days following the Settlement Date, an amount equal to the full amount by which the Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price.

(the " _Seller Restricted Business_ ") and (ii) no Restricted Party will acquire a controlling interest in or take an active part in the management of an entity whose principal business is a Seller Restricted Business. The term " _principal business_ " as used herein shall mean any business in which the North American revenues for microwave popcorn, or other products whose principal ingredient is popped popcorn, are more than 25% of the total annual revenue of the subject entity.

 (b) The Parties intend that each of the covenants contained in this _Section 4.02_ shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each state of the United States and each county of each state of the United States (and the equivalent subdivisions of any country outside of the United States). Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant contained in the preceding subsections of this _Section 4.02_. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in those subsections, then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.

The unenforceability of any covenant in this _Section 4.02_ shall not preclude the enforcement of any other of said covenants or provisions or of any other obligation of Seller or Buyer hereunder, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Seller or Buyer against the other whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Seller or Buyer of any of said covenants.

It is understood and agreed that damages will be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach by any Restricted Party of any of the covenants of such Restricted Party, in this _Section 4.02_, and that any such breach may cause Buyer irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that may be available to Buyer for such violation or breach, Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies otherwise available to Buyer, and without the posting of any bond or other security, to injunctive and other such equitable relief in the event of a breach of any of said covenants by any Restricted Party.

 (b) In the event that Seller is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 4.03_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver from Buyer, Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided_ , that Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer designates. 

   

 (c) Seller acknowledges that Buyer has required that Seller make the agreements in this  _Section 4.03_ as a condition to Buyers willingness to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 4.03_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and that any violation or breach of this _Section 4.03_ will result in irreparable injury to Buyer for which no adequate remedy would exist at law. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that may be available to Buyer for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, and without the posting of any bond or other security, Buyer will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach.

   ##### 

  

   

packaging) and, thereby, cease use of the Transferred Marks as soon as

item, the first re-printing in which changes can reasonably be made, (c) the
scope of the right is limited to selling or distributing such
Marked Materials without modifying such Transferred Marks, (d) Seller and its

and materials on which the Transferred Marks appear, and (e) Seller and its
Affiliates shall not use such Transferred Marks in any other manner without
the prior written consent of Buyer. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller, its Affiliates and their respective licensees shall have the limited right to continue to use any Transferred Marks that, as of the Closing Date, are included in the " _Merchandise Licenses_ " as set forth on _Section 2.08_ of the Disclosure Schedules, but only for the specific licensed products (and related advertising and promotional material) permitted under such Merchandise Licenses, and only for the remaining terms of such Merchandise Licenses.

 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

   

 (b) by Buyer if there has been a material breach on the part of Seller of the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement ( _provided_ that such 

   ##### 

  

   

breach is not the result of any breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty of Buyer), which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days
following Sellers receipt of written notice of such breach, and such breach
renders the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ incapable of being
satisfied; 

   

 (c) by Seller if there has been a material breach on the part of Buyer of the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement ( _provided_ that such breach is not the result of any breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of Seller), which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following Buyers receipt of written notice of such breach, and such breach renders the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02_ incapable of being satisfied; 

   

 (d) by either Party if there shall be any law or regulation that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree enjoining either Party from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is entered and such judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become final and nonappealable; or 

   

 (e) by either Party if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated by October 31, 2008 or such other date, if any, as the Parties shall mutually agree upon in writing; _provided_ , however, that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if such Partys willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.01_, all provisions of this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Seller; _provided_ , however, that _Article X_ hereof shall survive indefinitely; and _provided further,_ that the Parties shall remain liable for intentional and material breaches of any representations, warranties and covenants prior to the time of such termination. 

  

ARTICLE IX. SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 9.01 _Survival of Indemnification Obligations_.

Sellers indemnification obligations with respect to Excluded Liabilities (set forth in _Section 9.02(a)(iii)_), on the one hand, and Buyers indemnification obligations with respect to (a) Assumed Liabilities (set forth in _Section 9.03(a)(iii)_ ) and (b) International Distributors (set forth in _Section 5.02(a)_), on the other, shall continue in full force and effect forever. The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for such other shorter period as is explicitly set forth therein, except that for such covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period, indemnification for breaches thereof shall survive for a period of eighteen (18) months after the date of such breach. Any matter as to which a Notifying 

   ##### 

  

    

Party has asserted a claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Article IX_ during
the applicable survival period specified in this _Section 9.01_, which is
pending or unresolved at the end of the applicable survival period, shall
continue to be covered by this _Article IX_ until such matter is finally
terminated or otherwise resolved by the Parties or by arbitration, pursuant
to _Section 9.06_ hereto, and any amounts payable hereunder are
finally determined and paid. 

  

 9.02 _Indemnification by Seller_  

  

 (a) Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders in his, her or its capacity as such (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") and defend and hold them harmless against any loss, liability, deficiency, damage, fine, penalty, expense or cost, including settlement costs, court costs and the reasonable expenses of legal counsel (which shall be limited to one primary law firm and, where applicable, one law firm as local counsel per indemnifiable matter) (but excluding incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, lost profits and any other similar types of damages, except to the extent such damages are paid to a third party following a final adjudication or dispute resolution) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to from and after the Closing Date, as a result of (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in  _Article II_ of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date;  _provided_ that, for indemnification with respect to a breach as of the Closing Date, the breached representation or warranty must be materially breached as of the Closing Date, (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any agreement or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement or (iii) any Excluded Liability (collectively, " _Buyer Losses_ "). 

   

 (b) No claim for indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ shall be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any breach resulting in an individual item of Loss, or related items of Losses arising out of the same facts and circumstances, unless and until the amount of such Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds $25,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), at which point a claim can be made for the entire amount of such Losses. Further, no individual item which is less than the Threshold, or series of related items which in the aggregate are less than the Threshold, shall be considered when determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Threshold shall not apply to any claim for Indemnification resulting from any claim under _Sections 2.01, 2.02_ and _2.06(a)_ , any Excluded Liability or any Purchase Price Adjustment (collectively, the " _Unlimited Indemnification Claims_ "), and all Losses claimed for Unlimited Indemnification Claims shall be indemnified by Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.02_. 

   

 (c) No claim for indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ shall be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds $500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "). In the event that the aggregate amount of all Losses of all Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible, such Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under _Article IX_ only for the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Deductible. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 9.02(c)_ to the contrary, the Deductible shall not apply to Losses for Unlimited Indemnification Claims. 

    

28 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

   

 (d) The maximum aggregate obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Buyer Losses under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ shall not exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 9.02(d)_ to the contrary, the Cap shall not apply to Losses for Unlimited Indemnification Claims. 

   

 9.03 _Indemnification by Buyer_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and each of its officers, managers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date; _provided_  that, for indemnification with respect to a breach as of the Closing Date, the breached representation or warranty must be materially breached as of the Closing Date, (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or (iii) any Assumed Liability (collectively, " _Seller Losses_ "). 

   

 (b) No claim for indemnification under _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ shall be made by a Seller Indemnified Party with respect to any breach resulting in an individual item of Loss, or related items of Losses arising out of the same facts and circumstances, unless and until the amount of such Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Threshold, at which point a claim can be made for the entire amount of such Loss or Losses. Further, no individual item which is less than the Threshold, or series of related items which in the aggregate are less than the Threshold, shall be considered when determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded. 

   

 (c) No claim for indemnification under _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ shall be made by a Seller Indemnified Party unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible. In the event that the aggregate amount of all Losses of all Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible, such Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under _Article IX_ only for the amount by which the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Deductible. 

   

 (d) The maximum aggregate obligation of Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for Seller Losses under _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ shall not exceed the Cap. 

   

 9.04 _Method of Asserting Claims_. As used herein, an " _Indemnified Party_ " shall refer to a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ " or " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " as applicable, the " _Notifying Party_ " shall refer to the party hereto whose Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the " _Indemnifying Party_ " shall refer to the party hereto obligated to indemnify such Notifying Partys Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (a) _Third Party Claims_. In the event that any of the Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification with respect to a Loss arising from any action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any third party for which the liability or the costs or expenses are Losses (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _Claim_ "), the Notifying 

   ##### 

   

 

Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof. The failure to
give such notice shall not affect any Indemnified Partys ability to seek
indemnification unless the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that such failure
has materially and adversely affected the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend successfully a Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
contest and defend such Claim by delivering notice of its intention to the
Notifying Party within twenty one (21) days after the Notifying Partys
notice of such Claim. The Notifying Party shall be entitled at any time, at
its own cost and expense (which cost and expense shall not constitute a Loss
unless specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party or unless the
Notifying Party reasonably determines that the Indemnifying Party is not
adequately representing or, because of a conflict of interest, may not
adequately represent, any interests of the Indemnified Parties, and only to
the extent that such expenses are reasonable), to participate in such contest
and defense and to be represented by attorneys of its or their own choosing.
If the Notifying Party elects to participate in such defense, the Notifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such
defense. Neither the Notifying Party nor the Indemnifying Party may
concede, settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the other
party, which consents shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. 

   

 (b) _Direct Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Claim, the Notifying Party shall deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Notifying Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Notifying Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice by the Notifying Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Notifying Partys notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.02_ or _9.03_ , as applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Notifying Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If the dispute is not resolved through such negotiations within sixty (60) days after the delivery of the Notifying Partys notice of such claim (the " _Resolution Period_ "), the Notifying Party shall be entitled to seek resolution of such claim by seeking arbitration pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.06_ hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any such Loss no later than ten (10) business days following the determination of the Indemnifying Partys liability (whether such determination is made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Section 9.04(b)_, by agreement between the Indemnifying Party and the Notifying Party or by final resolution of the Notifying Partys arbitration claim). 

   

 (c) _Sole Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights set forth in this _Article IX_, in _Section 1.04_ , _Section 5.02_ and in _Section 6.03_ shall be each Partys sole and exclusive remedies against the other Parties hereto for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, other than an action for specific performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the Indemnified Parties from bringing an action based upon allegations of (i) fraud or (ii) willful breach with the intent to cause harm to the other Party, in each case, in connection with this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Any indemnification payable under this _Article IX_ shall be, to the extent permitted by law, an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

 9.05 _Certain Additional Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller nor its successors and assigns shall have any liability for, and a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to bring any indemnification claim against Seller or its successors or assigns for, a Loss, to the extent that the amount thereof was the basis of an adjustment made to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.04_ hereof. 

   

 (b) All Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party shall be net of insurance proceeds actually received and any amounts such Indemnified Party actually recovers from third parties. 

   

 (c) If an Indemnifying Party hereunder indemnifies an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 9.02(a)_ or _9.03(a)_ with actual payments in respect of incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, lost profits or any other similar types of damages paid by the indemnified party to a third party following a final adjudication or dispute resolution and such adjudication or dispute resolution is subsequently appealed or reversed such that such damages are not paid to the third party or are reimbursed to the Indemnified Party by the third party, such Indemnified Party shall remit the indemnification payment back to the Indemnifying Party up to the amount so indemnified and either not paid or reimbursed. 

   

 9.06 _Arbitration_. Any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before J.A.M.S. or its successor (" _J.A.M.S._ ") pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq., and any such arbitration shall be conducted in Chicago, Illinois. If J.A.M.S. ceases to provide arbitration service, then the term "J.A.M.S." shall thereafter mean and refer to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Either Buyer or Seller may commence the arbitration process called for by this Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and delivering a copy of such demand to the other party to this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 10.04_. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of J.A.M.S Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration (or, if J.A.M.S. then means the AAA, the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA then in effect), subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.06_. Other than as expressly set forth in this _Article IX_, the applicable statutes of limitation and/or other time-based defenses shall be available to the parties, and applicable to disputes between the parties, as if this were an action filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall cooperate with J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly selecting an arbitrator from J.A.M.S. panel of neutrals and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings in order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm from occurring prior to the selection of the arbitrator. The parties covenant that they shall participate in the arbitration in good faith. The provisions of this _Section 9.06_ may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, award the prevailing party its costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys fees incurred in connection with the arbitration; _provided_  

   ##### 

  

 

that, (a) if such costs, fees and expenses are determined by the arbitrator
to constitute an indemnifiable Loss hereunder, then the party responsible for
indemnifying for such Losses shall be responsible to do so and (b), if such
costs, fees and expenses are not determined by the arbitrator to
constitute an indemnifiable Loss hereunder, and the arbitrator has not
awarded the prevailing party its costs, fees and expenses, then each party
shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses (including 50% of the fees, costs
and expenses of the arbitrator). Judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
