 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS._     

 _Closing Transactions._    

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Companies and the
Sellers set forth below, on the Closing Date the Buyer shall purchase from
each of the Sellers and each of the Sellers shall sell to the Buyer all of
such Sellers Interests, free and clear of all Liens. The aggregate purchase
price for the Interests (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be paid as
follows:     

 (i) on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay the Sellers $139,300,000 less the amounts set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ in cash (the " _Closing Purchase Price_ ");    

 (ii) on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deposit seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000) (the " _Indemnity Escrow Deposit_ ") of the Purchase Price into an escrow fund, to be governed by the terms of an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "), to secure the obligations of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for breaches (if any) of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of any of the Companies or the Sellers;    

 (iii) on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deposit twelve million five hundred thousand dollars ($12,500,000) (the " _DoE Amount_ ") into an escrow fund (the " _DoE Escrow Fund_ "), to be governed by the terms of an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ (the " _DoE Escrow Agreement_ " and, together with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the " _Escrow Agreements_ "), to secure Buyers obligation (if any) to pay additional Purchase Price to the Sellers pursuant to Section 3.3;    

 (iv) on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid on behalf of the Companies the outstanding indebtedness reflected on  _Schedule 2.1(a)_ (the " _Closing Date Indebtedness_ "); and    

 (v) within the time set forth in Section 3.2, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount of the Working Capital Surplus (if any) determined in accordance with Section 3.1.  

On the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative, on behalf of each of
the Sellers, shall deliver to the Buyer the Interest Transfer Documents
related to such Sellers Interests being purchased by the Buyer from such
Seller, duly executed for transfer. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay
to the Sellers an aggregate amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price. Such
amount shall be paid to the Sellers in the amounts and in accordance with the
written instructions to be provided by the Sellers to the Buyer not less than
two (2) days prior to the Closing Date. Such payments shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as each such Seller
shall designate in writing to the Buyer not less than two (2) days prior to
the Closing Date.   

(c) The Buyer and the Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that for purposes
of this Agreement, the amount of the residual payment owed to CFSC Capital
Corp., XXXIV (" _Cargill_ ") under the terms of the Credit Agreement, dated
as of August 15, 2001 by and between WAP, as borrower, and Cargill, as lender
(the " _Cargill Agreement_ "), is $15,700,000 (the " _Cargill
Residual Amount_ "). On the Closing Date, the Buyer will assume the Cargill
Residual Amount as part of the Purchase Price, and the Closing Purchase Price
reflects the deduction of the Cargill Residual Amount from the amount
otherwise payable to the Sellers by the Buyer on the     ##### 

  

    

Closing Date. The Buyer and the Sellers further acknowledge and agree that
they will treat, for federal and state income tax purposes, the Buyers
assumption of the Cargill Residual Amount as the assumption by the Buyer of a
liability in the principal amount of $15,700,000. To the extent that the
actual Cargill Residual Amount exceeds $15,700,000, the Sellers shall have no
liability to the Buyer for the amount of such excess residual amount, and
such excess residual amount shall not be deemed a Loss under this Agreement.
To the extent that the actual Cargill Residual Amount is less than
$15,700,000, the Buyer and the Guarantor shall have no liability to the
Sellers for the amount that the actual Cargill Residual Amount is less than
$15,700,000.

Sellers Representative a stock power or other written assignment of
Interests, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto (the "
_Interest Transfer Documents_ "), of each Sellers Interests being purchased
by the Buyer from such Seller, duly executed for transfer. The
Sellers Representative shall hold the Interest Transfer Documents deposited
by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) in escrow until the Closing,
at which time the Sellers Representative shall deliver such Interest
Transfer Documents to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.1(b).   

(b) In accordance with the provisions of Section 15, the
Sellers Representative shall make any and all determinations and
calculations on behalf of each Seller set forth in this Agreement which
determinations and calculations shall be binding upon each Seller as if made
by such Seller.   

 _POST-CLOSING PAYMENTS_.   

Post-Closing Working Capital Determination. As promptly as practicable and
in any event within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers the consolidated balance sheet
of the Companies as of the close of business on the date prior to the Closing
Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a basis consistent with, and following the accounting principles,
procedures, policies and methods employed in preparing the December 31
Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet shall set forth a calculation of the
Working Capital as of the close of business on the date prior to the Closing
Date. During the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Buyer and
the period of any dispute with respect to the application of this Section
3.1, the Sellers shall cooperate with the Buyer to the extent reasonably
requested by the Buyer to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet or to investigate
the basis for any dispute. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be examined by the
Sellers Representative, and the Sellers Representative shall, not later
than 30 calendar days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, render a
report thereon (the "Closing Balance Sheet Report"). The Closing Balance
Sheet Report shall list those items, if any, to which the Sellers
Representative takes exception and the Sellers Representatives proposed
adjustment. If the Sellers Representative fails to deliver to the Buyer the
Closing Balance Sheet Report within thirty (30) calendar days following
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet (such thirty (30) day period conditioned
upon all such information reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative
being promptly provided to the Sellers Representative by the Buyer), the
Sellers  Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Balance Sheet for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 3.2. If the Buyer does not give the Sellers Representative notice of
objections within 30 calendar days following receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet Report, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance
Sheet as adjusted by the Sellers Representative for the purposes of
determining any Post Closing     ##### 

  

    

Working Capital Adjustment under Section 3.2. If the Buyer gives the
Sellers Representative notice of objections to the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall, during the 30 days following
such delivery, use their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts (the "Disputed Amounts"). If the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer are unable, within 30 calendar days after
receipt by the Sellers Representative of the notice from the Buyer of
objections, to resolve the Disputed Amounts, such Disputed Amounts shall be
referred to KPMG LLP or another firm of independent certified public
accountants (the "Independent Accounting Firm") mutually acceptable to the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer. The Independent Accounting Firm shall,
within 60 days following its selection, deliver to the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer a written report determining the proper
treatment of such disputed exceptions, and its determinations shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties thereto for the purposes of
determining any Post Closing Working Capital Adjustment under Section 3.2.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm acting under
this Section 3.1 shall be shared equally by the Buyer on the one hand and the
Sellers on the other; provided, however, that if the Working Capital, giving
effect to the Independent Accounting Firms computation of the Disputed
Amounts, is more than 105% of the Working Capital originally calculated by
the Sellers Representative in the Closing Balance Sheet Report, then the
Buyer shall bear all of such expenses; and provided, further, that if the
Working Capital, giving effect to the Independent Accounting
Firms computation of the Disputed Amounts, is less than 95% of the Working
Capital originally calculated by the Sellers Representative in the Closing
Balance Sheet Report, then the Sellers shall bear all of such expenses.
Any liabilities included in the calculation of Working Capital pursuant to
this Section 3.1 will not constitute a breach of any of the Companies or
the Sellers representations and warranties and will not give the Buyer any
right to indemnification under this Agreement.   

Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment. As promptly as practicable, and
in any event within five (5) Business Days, after the preparation,
computation and final determination pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Closing
Balance Sheet, (i) if there is a Working Capital Surplus, the Buyer shall pay
to the Sellers as additional Purchase Price an amount equal to the Working
Capital Surplus determined using figures from the Closing Balance Sheet and
(ii) if there is a Working Capital Deficit, then such Working Capital Deficit
shall be deemed a Loss for purposes of Section 11.2 (such payment being
referred to as the "Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment"). Any payment
made pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall include simple interest at the rate
of 2.75% per annum from the Closing Date through the date of such payment.
All payments required under this Section 3.2 shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as shall be
designated in writing by the recipient(s). Department of Education Payment.
As additional Purchase Price, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the DoE
Amount, if, and only if, (i) on or before December 31, 2005, the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including NAM after the Closing) are awarded a Department of
Education contract that conforms in all material respects to the terms
specified in the RFP attached as Schedule 3.3, (ii) on or before December 31,
2005, NAMs existing Department of Education contract is extended to expire
no earlier than December 31, 2005 or (iii) the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including NAM) is continuing to perform under NAMs existing Department of
Education contract on December 31, 2005 and has so performed at all times
since the date of this Agreement. The DoE Amount will be deposited into an
escrow fund to be governed by the terms     ##### 

  

    

of the DoE Escrow Agreement. The DoE Amount, if earned, will be payable
solely from the DoE Escrow Fund.   

 _CLOSING_.

this Agreement shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. on August 1, 2004,

Sellers Representative elects to defend shall not be subject to this
Section 11.2(c)(v);     

(vi) the maximum amount for which a Seller shall be liable with respect to
matters arising from breaches of Section 6.1 shall not exceed in
the aggregate such Sellers Seller Percentage of the Purchase Price; 

(vii) with respect to Losses caused by fraud only with respect to
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, there shall be

Sellers shall be liable is $500,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any third
party claims described in Section 11.3(b)(iv) that the Sellers

11.2(c)(ix).  

(d) For purposes of determining the dollar amount of any Loss arising from
any untruth or inaccuracy in any representation or certification or the
breach of any warranty, all materiality qualifications set forth therein
shall be disregarded.   

(e) Any recovery for Losses for which Sellers may be liable shall be made
first against the Indemnity Escrow Deposit. Any recovery for Losses may be
made directly against the Sellers only if the Indemnity Escrow Deposit
is insufficient or no longer in existence and to the extent that recovery of
such Losses is not subject to the limitations set forth in Section
11.2(c).     

 _Procedures for Indemnification._      

(a)    

 (i) If a party entitled to indemnification under this Section 11 (an "Indemnitee") asserts that a party obligated to indemnify it under this Section 11 (an "Indemnitor") has become obligated to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11.2 or if any suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding is begun, made or instituted as a result of which the Indemnitor may become obligated to an Indemnitee hereunder, such Indemnitee shall give written notice signed by an authorized officer, as applicable, (the "Indemnity Notice") to the Indemnitor and the Sellers Representative. In case the Sellers Representative shall so object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Indemnity Notice, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to such claims. If the Sellers    ##### 

  

   

Representative and the Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent (as defined in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement). The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute
cash from the Indemnity Escrow Deposit (as defined in the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement) to any Indemnitee in accordance with the terms thereof.    

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Buyer or the Sellers Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss at issue is in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one (1) arbitrator selected by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions to the same extent as a court of law or equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The non-prevailing party to the dispute shall pay all costs of the arbitration, including attorneys fees and costs of the prevailing party. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnity Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator.    

 (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Cobb County, Georgia under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.   

 (b) If the Buyer receives notice of a third-party claim that the Buyer believes may result in a claim against the Escrow Deposit, the Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative in writing of such claim (but the failure to promptly notify the Sellers Representative shall not relieve the Sellers of their indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent (and only to such extent) that the Sellers Representative or any Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify). The Sellers Representative, as a representative for the Sellers, may, at his election, undertake control of the defense thereof with counsel of his choosing reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, in which case the Buyer may participate in such defense through its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Sellers Representative elects to undertake control of the defense of such claim, the Sellers Representative shall not settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall not be entitled to undertake the defense of a third party claim if (i) such claim involves a purported class action (other than class action claims pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection    ##### 

  

 

Practices Act), (ii) such claim involves Taxes and the Buyer
reasonably determines that the claim would have an impact on Tax Returns that
include periods after the Closing Date, (iii) such claim demands injunctive
or other equitable relief, (iv) the Buyer reasonably determines based upon
the advice of counsel that such claim is likely to exceed 125% of the
remaining amounts in the Escrow Deposit, (v) the Sellers Representative or
any Seller is also a party to such third-party claim or (vi) the Buyer
reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to
represent all parties under applicable standards of legal ethics; provided,
however, that the Sellers Representative may elect to undertake the defense
of a third party claim set forth in clause (iv) above, but if the Sellers
Representative so elects then the limitations on liability set forth in
Sections 11.2(c)(ii), 11.2(c)(iii), 11.2(c)(iv) and 11.2(c)(v) shall not
apply to such claim. If the Sellers Representative declines to undertake the
defense of such claim within thirty (30) days after written notice of such
claim has been delivered to the Sellers Representative or fails to
diligently defend such claim at any time, the Buyer may, in its reasonable
discretion, assume the defense of any such claim with counsel of its choice,
and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall constitute Losses. The Buyer
shall advise the Sellers Representative of material developments and
otherwise keep the Sellers Representative informed with respect to such
third-party claim; provided, however, that the Buyer shall not be required to
provide any confidential or non-public information. If the Sellers
Representative elects to undertake the defense of a third-party claim, the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to recover its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses that relate to such third-party claim
from the Indemnity Escrow Deposit immediately prior to the expiration of the
Indemnity Escrow Deposit out of amounts that would otherwise be distributed
to the Sellers; provided, however, that any and all Losses incurred by the
Buyer, its officers, directors or affiliates (including the Companies) that
are recoverable against the Indemnity Escrow Deposit and any amounts
necessary to satisfy unresolved claims pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall be
satisfied in full or reserved for before any attorneys fees and expenses of
the Sellers Representative may be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Deposit. If
the Buyer undertakes the defense of a third-party claim or if the Sellers
Representative fails to diligently defend such claim at any time, the Buyer
shall have the right in its reasonable discretion to settle any such claim;
provided, however, that except with the consent of the
Sellers Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third-party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount, validity or existence of any
claim against the Indemnity Escrow Deposit. If the Sellers Representative
has consented to any such settlement, the Sellers Representative shall have
no power or authority to object under any provision of this Section 11.3 to
the amount of any claim by the Buyer against the Indemnity Escrow Deposit
with respect to and in the amount of such settlement. The Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any third-party claim, including
making available records relating to such claim and furnishing employees of
the Buyer or the Companies as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation
of the defense of any such third-party claim or for testimony as witness in
any proceeding relating to such claim.   

Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, absent fraud on the part of any party, indemnification claims
brought in accordance with and subject to this Section 11 shall be the
exclusive remedy of any Indemnitee after the Closing with respect to, arising
out of or resulting from the subject matter of this Agreement.     ##### 

  

    

Tax Effect and Insurance. The amount of any Losses shall be reduced by the
tax benefit actually realized and any insurance proceeds received by any
Indemnitee as a result of any Losses upon which such claim is based. The
amount of any such tax benefit shall be determined by taking into account the
effect, if any and to the extent determinable, of timing differences
resulting from the acceleration or deferral of items of gain or loss
resulting from such Losses and shall otherwise be determined so that payment
by the Indemnitor of the claim, as adjusted to give effect to any such tax
benefit, will make the Indemnitee as economically whole as is reasonably
practical with respect to the Losses upon which the claim is based.   

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANIES AND THE SELLERS.   

The obligations of the Companies and the Sellers to perform their
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions

hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Worldwide Assets, Inc. and its
successors, acting as hereinafter provided, as its attorney-in-fact and agent
in its name, place and stead in connection with the transactions and
agreements contemplated by this Agreement and any Related Agreement (the
"Sellers Representative"), and acknowledges that such appointment is coupled
with an interest and is intended to be durable and to survive the disability
or mental incapacity of each Seller. By executing and delivering this

Authorizes the Sellers Representative: (i) to prepare, finalize, approve
and authorize all exhibits, schedules and other attachments to this Agreement
and all other agreements and other documents (including, without
limitation, documents delivered pursuant to Section 2 or 3) delivered by the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Seller Delivered Agreements_ ")
and such approval and authorization may be conclusively evidenced by the
Sellers Representative and (ii) to execute and deliver, and to accept
delivery, on his behalf of such amendments as may be deemed by the Sellers
Representative in its sole discretion to be appropriate under the Seller
Delivered Agreements;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 15 shall be deemed to authorize the Sellers Representative to
communicate any inaccurate or misleading information to the Buyer on behalf
of any Seller. Agrees to be bound by all notices received and agreements and
determinations made by and documents executed and delivered by the Sellers
Representative under the Seller Delivered Agreements.   

Authorizes the Sellers Representative: (i) to dispute or to refrain
from disputing and thereby accept any claim made by the Buyer under the

such things as the Sellers Representative shall deem appropriate to carry
out the provisions of the Seller Delivered Agreements.   

Actions. Each Seller hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that (a)
the Sellers Representative is exclusively authorized to act on its
behalf, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers, and
(b) the Buyer and any other person or entity shall be entitled to rely on any
and all actions taken by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement and
the other Seller Delivered Agreements without any liability to, or obligation
to inquire of, any of the Sellers. All notices, counternotices or other
instruments or designations delivered by any Seller or the Sellers
Representative shall not be effective unless, but shall be effective
if,     ##### 

  

    

signed by the Sellers Representative, and if not, such document shall have
no force and effect whatsoever hereunder and the Buyer and any other person
or entity may proceed without regard to any such document. The Buyer and any
other person or entity are hereby expressly authorized to rely on the
genuineness of the signature of the Sellers Representative, and upon receipt
of any writing which reasonably appears to have been signed by the Sellers
Representative, the Buyer and any other person or entity may act upon the
same without any further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the
writing.   

Effectiveness _._ The authorization of the Sellers Representative shall
be irrevocable and effective until its rights and obligations under this
Agreement terminate by virtue of the termination of this Agreement and any
and all of the obligations of the Sellers to the Buyer under the Seller
Delivered Agreements.  

Indemnification; Fees and Expenses _._ The Sellers hereby jointly and
severally agree (a) to indemnify and hold the Sellers Representative
harmless from any and all Losses, and (b) that the Sellers Representative

hereunder, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct.   

Successor. Upon ninety (90) day prior written notice to the Companies,
the Sellers Representative shall have the right to resign at his sole
discretion for any reason at any time and in such event, the Sellers
Representative shall continue to have all rights to indemnification, fees and
expenses as provided in Section 15.5 above. If the Sellers Representative
resigns or ceases to function in its capacity as such for any reason
whatsoever, such Sellers Representative shall immediately give notice to the
other parties to this Agreement. In such event, Darrell T. Hanna shall be
appointed as the successor Sellers Representative; provided, however, that
if for any reason Darrell T. Hanna shall not be appointed as the successor
within ninety (90) days after the Sellers Representative resigns or
otherwise ceases to function, then the Buyer shall have the right, upon
notice to each Seller and opportunity to be heard, to petition a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of one or more successors to be
selected from among those Sellers employed by the Companies or any of their
Affiliates as of the date of such petition so long as any such Seller is
still so employed.   

Survival of Authorizations. EACH SELLER INTENDS FOR THE AUTHORIZATIONS
AND AGREEMENTS IN THE FOREGOING SECTIONS OF THIS SECTION 15 TO REMAIN IN
FORCE AND NOT BE AFFECTED IF SUCH SELLER SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMES MENTALLY OR
PHYSICALLY DISABLED, INCOMPETENT OR INCAPACITATED, DOES HEREBY AUTHORIZE SUCH
RECORDINGS AND FILINGS HEREOF AS THE SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE MAY DEEM
APPROPRIATE, AND DOES HEREBY DIRECT THAT NO FILING OF ACCOUNTS OR INVENTORIES
OR POSTING OF A SURETY BOND SHALL BE REQUIRED.  

 _GUARANTEE._     

 To induce the Sellers to enter into this Agreement and in consideration of the benefits to be received by the Guarantor from the transactions contemplated hereby, the Guarantor unconditionally guarantees the payment and timely performance when due of any and all obligations of the Buyer or any assignee of the Buyer under this Agreement. Upon default by the Buyer in making any payment hereunder or any other failure to perform its obligations hereunder, the Guarantor shall make such payment or cause such obligation to be performed promptly upon demand of the Sellers.    ##### 

  

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_.   

Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
no party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any such attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be
void and of no force and effect; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign
its rights hereunder to an Affiliate; provided further, that no such
assignment shall reduce or otherwise vitiate any of the obligations of the
Buyer or the Guarantor hereunder. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the
parties hereto.   

Governing Law, Arbitration. This Agreement shall be construed, performed
and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict or choice of law rules
thereof. In the event of a dispute not subject to Section 11.3, the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to such claims. If no
such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Buyer
or the Sellers Representative may demand arbitration of the matter. The
arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator selected by the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while
allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the
arbitrator, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to
compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions,
including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of law or
equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator as to the
validity and amount of any claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions, which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator. Judgment upon
any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Cobb County, Georgia
under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.   

Expenses. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, all of the
fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such fees, expenses and costs. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Sellers shall pay all of the fees, expenses and costs of
the Companies incurred in connection with this Agreement (including brokers
fees and fees and costs of legal counsel and accountants) and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any fee, expense or cost of the Companies
or the Sellers that is incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby that is paid by any of the Companies (a
"Third Party Expense") shall be deemed to be a Loss to the extent such Third
Party Expense has not caused an adjustment to the Working Capital pursuant to
Section 3.1 (the extent to which such Third Party Expense has not caused an
adjustment to the Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.1, an "Excess Third
Party Expense").   

Severability. In the event that any part of this Agreement is declared by
any court or other judicial or administrative body to be null, void
or unenforceable, said provision shall survive to the extent it is not
so declared, and all of the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in       ##### 

  

    

full force and effect. To the extent permitted by law, each party
hereto waives any provision of law that renders any such provision prohibited
or unenforceable in any respect.   

Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given (i) on the date of service if served personally on the party to whom
notice is to be given; (ii) on the day of transmission if sent via facsimile
transmission to the facsimile number given below, and telephonic confirmation
of receipt is obtained promptly after completion of transmission; (iii) on
the day after deposit to Federal Express or similar overnight courier or the
