report determining the proper treatment of such disputed exceptions, and its
determinations shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties thereto for the
purposes of determining any Post Closing Working Capital Adjustment under
Section&nbsp;3.2. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm
acting under this Section&nbsp;3.1 shall be shared equally by the Buyer on the one
hand and the Sellers on the other; provided, however, that if the Working
Capital, giving effect to the Independent Accounting Firm&#146;s computation of the
Disputed Amounts, is more than 105% of the Working Capital originally
calculated by the Sellers&#146; Representative in the Closing Balance Sheet Report,
then the Buyer shall bear all of such expenses; and provided, further, that if
the Working Capital, giving effect to the Independent Accounting Firm&#146;s
computation of the Disputed Amounts, is less than 95% of the Working Capital
originally calculated by the Sellers&#146; Representative in the Closing Balance
Sheet Report, then the Sellers shall bear all of such expenses. Any
liabilities included in the calculation of Working Capital pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;3.1 will not constitute a breach of any of the Companies&#146; or the
Sellers&#146; representations and warranties and will not give the Buyer any right
to indemnification under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment. As promptly as practicable, and in

Working Capital Adjustment&#148;). Any payment made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.2
shall include simple interest at the rate of 2.75% per annum from the Closing

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and
has not, in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement, cured such breach
within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after written notice to the Companies and the
Sellers (provided, that the Buyer is not then in material breach of the terms
of this Agreement, and provided further, that no cure period shall be required
for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured) such that the conditions set
forth in Section&nbsp;13.1 or Section&nbsp;13.2 hereof, as the case may be, will not be
satisfied;</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>By the Sellers if the Buyer has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement and has not, in the case of a breach
of a covenant or agreement, cured such breach within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days
after written notice to the Buyer (provided, that none of the Companies nor any

transactions contemplated hereby; or (ii)&nbsp;there shall be any final action
taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued
or deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby by any
Governmental Entity which would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby illegal; or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">By the Sellers or the Buyers if the Closing shall not have been consummated by
September&nbsp;1, 2004 for any reason, provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section&nbsp;14.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been both
willful and the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date.</B>

provided in Section&nbsp;14.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Companies, the
Sellers or the Buyer, or their respective officers, directors, stockholders,
partners, option holders or other Persons under their control, except to the
extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party hereto
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, and provided that the provisions of Sections&nbsp;14.2, 17.2, 17.3,
17.5, 17.6, 17.7 and 17.14, hereof shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Appointment; Acceptance. By executing this Agreement, each Seller hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Worldwide Assets, Inc. and its successors,
acting as hereinafter provided, as its attorney-in-fact and agent in its name,
place and stead in connection with the transactions and agreements contemplated
by this Agreement and any Related Agreement (the &#147;Sellers&#146; Representative&#148;),

whatsoever hereunder and the Buyer and any other person or entity may proceed
without regard to any such document. The Buyer and any other person or entity

the Sellers&#146; Representative, and upon receipt of any writing which reasonably
appears to have been signed by the Sellers&#146; Representative, the Buyer and any
other person or entity may act upon the same without any further duty of
inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

in Section&nbsp;15.5 above. If the Sellers&#146; Representative resigns or ceases to
function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, such Sellers&#146;
Representative shall immediately give notice to the other parties to this
Agreement. In such event, Darrell T. Hanna shall be appointed as the successor
Sellers&#146; Representative; provided, however, that if for any reason Darrell T.
Hanna shall not be appointed as the successor within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the
Sellers&#146; Representative resigns or otherwise ceases to function, then the Buyer
shall have the right, upon notice to each Seller and opportunity to be heard,
to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of one or
more successors to be selected from among those Sellers employed by the
Companies or any of their Affiliates as of the date of such petition so long as
any such Seller is still so employed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Survival of Authorizations. EACH SELLER INTENDS FOR THE AUTHORIZATIONS AND
AGREEMENTS IN THE FOREGOING SECTIONS OF THIS SECTION 15 TO REMAIN IN FORCE AND
NOT BE AFFECTED IF SUCH SELLER SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMES MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY
DISABLED, INCOMPETENT OR INCAPACITATED, DOES HEREBY AUTHORIZE SUCH RECORDINGS
AND FILINGS HEREOF AS THE SELLERS&#146; REPRESENTATIVE MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE, AND
DOES HEREBY DIRECT THAT NO FILING OF ACCOUNTS OR INVENTORIES OR POSTING OF A

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no
party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any such
attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be void and of no
force and effect; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign its rights
hereunder to an Affiliate; provided further, that no such assignment shall
reduce or otherwise vitiate any of the obligations of the Buyer or the
Guarantor hereunder. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Governing Law, Arbitration. This Agreement shall be construed, performed and
enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict or choice of law rules thereof.
In the event of a dispute not subject to Section&nbsp;11.3, the Sellers&#146;
Representative and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to such claims. If no such
agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Buyer or the
Sellers&#146; Representative may demand arbitration of the matter. The arbitration
shall be conducted by one (1)&nbsp;arbitrator selected by the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of
the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys&#146; fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of law or equity,
should the arbitrator determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of
any claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.
Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of
fact and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or
order awarded by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in Cobb County, Georgia under the rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Expenses. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, all of the fees,
expenses and costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto incurring
such fees, expenses and costs. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Sellers shall pay all of the fees, expenses and costs of the
Companies incurred in connection with this Agreement (including brokers&#146; fees
and fees and costs of legal counsel and accountants) and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any fee, expense or cost of the Companies or the Sellers
that is incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby that is paid by any of the Companies (a &#147;Third Party
Expense&#148;) shall be deemed to be a Loss to the extent such Third Party Expense
has not caused an adjustment to the Working Capital pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1
(the extent to which such Third Party Expense has not caused an adjustment to
the Working Capital pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1, an &#147;Excess Third Party Expense&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Severability. In the event that any part of this Agreement is declared by any
court or other judicial or administrative body to be null, void or
unenforceable, said provision shall survive to the extent it is not so
declared, and all of the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
