ARTICLE 2  PURCHASE AND SALE   Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell, or cause its Affiliates to sell, to Buyer or to Buyer\'s designee (which designee shall be a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer), and Buyer agrees to purchase, either itself or through such designee, from Seller and its Affiliates, the Shares at the Closing. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (the "Purchase Price") is $215,000,000 in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.05. The amount payable in cash to Seller at Closing (the "Closing Purchase Price") is equal to the Purchase Price, plus (i) if Estimated Working Capital exceeds Base Working Capital, the amount of such excess, or minus (ii) if Base Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital, the amount of such excess. The Closing Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02.   Section 2.02. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than five Business Days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 10, or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing:   (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Closing Purchase Price in  immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller  designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered  not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if not so  designated, then by certified or official bank check payable in immediately  available funds to the order of Seller in such amount).   (b) Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer  certificates for the Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers  duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto.   (c) Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver the Transition Services  Agreement.   Section 2.03. Estimated Working Capital. Not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate of an authorized officer of Seller (the "Estimated Closing Certificate") setting forth Seller\'s good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"). The Estimated Closing Certificate shall be accompanied by appropriate information and documentation in reasonable detail supporting Seller\'s estimate. The amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Certificate shall be conclusive for the purposes of calculating the Closing Purchase Price, but the actual Closing Working Capital and any resulting adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04.   Section 2.04. Closing Statement. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days, after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a closing statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Seller\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital as of the Closing Date. The Closing Statement shall be accompanied by appropriate information and documentation in reasonable detail in support of Seller\'s calculation.   (b) If Buyer disagrees with Seller\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), Buyer may, within 30 days after        delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.04(a), deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Buyer\'s calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees (the "Subjects of Disagreement"), and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed for purposes of this Section 2.04 with all items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) other than the Subjects of Disagreement.   (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 20 days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the Subjects of Disagreement in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital. If, during such period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement on the Subjects of Disagreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause a firm of independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or Seller), promptly to review the Closing Statement, Buyer\'s notice of disagreement and the Subjects of Disagreement for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital. In making such calculation, such independent accountants shall consider only the Subjects of Disagreement and the determination of such independent accountants with respect to each such Subject of Disagreement shall be an amount within the range established with respect to such item by Seller\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and Buyer\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b). Such independent accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be borne by Buyer and Seller pro rata based upon the proportion by which their respective determinations of Closing Working Capital differs from Final Closing Working Capital.   (d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause the independent accountants and each Company and each Subsidiary to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section, including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.   Section 2.05. Adjustment of Purchase Price. (a) If Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount of such excess. If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount of such excess. "Final Working Capital" means Closing Working Capital as shown in Seller\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section       2.04(a), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b); or if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, as agreed by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the independent accountant\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c); provided that, in no event shall Final Working Capital be more than Seller\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or less than Buyer\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b).   (b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within ten days after the Final Working Capital has been determined by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such other party as may be designated by such other party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.   Section 2.06. Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated for Tax purposes as set forth on Schedule 2.06. Buyer, the Companies and the Subsidiaries and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation. Buyer and Seller agree that, in the event of any payment that is treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made pursuant to Section 2.05, the allocation set forth on Schedule 2.06 shall be adjusted accordingly to take account of such adjustment, based on the extent to which the adjustment relates to each Company.

If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, any Company or any Subsidiary reduces a Tax liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or increases a Tax Asset that can be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax liability or the amount of any benefit resulting from such increase in Tax Assets, as the case may be. The benefit resulting from an increase in a Tax Asset shall be calculated on the same basis as applicable to Tax Benefits pursuant to Section 8.06.   (d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax but excluding any income Tax and any similar Tax) shall be borne and paid one half (1/2) by Seller and one half (1/2) by Buyer, and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Returns and other documentation.   (e) Notwithstanding Section 8.06(a), Buyer agrees that Seller is to have no liability for any Tax resulting from any action, referred to in Section 8.03(b), of any Company or Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or any Affiliate of Buyer, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against any such Tax (together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax or additional amount), any Tax or Damages incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates, arising out of a breach of any other covenant or agreement contained     in this Article 8, any Tax imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary that is not subject to Seller\'s indemnification obligation under Section 8.06(a) and (iv) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorney\'s fees and expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above. Seller agrees to give prompt notice to Buyer of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 8.03(e). Buyer may participate in any such suit, action or proceeding at its own expense and the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.   (f) Seller shall file a timely election under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-95(c) and 1.1502-95(f) to allocate a portion of the Seller Group\'s Code Section 382 limitation from prior ownership changes to the Companies and the Subsidiaries ("382 Allocation Amount"). Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the determination of the 382 Allocation Amount, which shall be a fair and equitable allocation from the Seller Group to the Companies and Subsidiaries. At Seller\'s request, Buyer shall cause any of the Companies or Subsidiaries to join with Seller in making any election required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-95(f).   (g) Buyer shall elect to waive carry-back to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Tax Asset of any Company or Subsidiary arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, with respect to any Tax Asset of any Company or Subsidiary arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period that is required to be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or with respect to which no election to waive carry-back is possible, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of any tax refund (or reduction in tax liability) resulting from carry-back of such Tax Asset into the Seller Group consolidated tax return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, net of any tax incurred as a result of such refund, when such refund (or reduction) is received or realized, as the case may be, by the Seller Group.   Section 8.04. Tax Sharing. Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that neither Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax sharing agreements or Tax groupings between any Company or any Subsidiary and any member of the Seller Group. This Agreement shall be the sole Tax sharing agreement relating to any Company or any Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.   Section 8.05. Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to each Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any return, for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Buyer and Seller agree (i) to retain or cause to be retained all books and     records pertinent to each Company and Subsidiary until the applicable period for assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority and (ii) to give the other party reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters and, if the other party so requests, Buyer and Company, or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving any Company for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this subsection.   Section 8.06. Indemnification by Seller. Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer, its Affiliates and, effective upon the Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary, against and agrees to hold them harmless from any Tax of Seller (or any predecessors), any of its Affiliates (or any predecessors), or any Company or any Subsidiary relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any loss or damage actually incurred or suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates and, effective upon the Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary, arising out of a breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Article 8 and liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys\' fees and expenses), arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax loss or damage described in clause (i) and (ii) above, including those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax described in clause (i) above, in each case incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company, or any Subsidiary (the sum of (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Loss"); provided, however, that Seller shall have no liability for the payment of any Loss attributable to or resulting from any action described in Section 8.03(b) hereof, including, but not limited to, an election made or deemed made by Buyer under Section 338 of the Code or any comparable provision of applicable law; provided, further, that Seller shall have no obligation to make any payment pursuant to this Section 8.06 if at the time the Loss is incurred or suffered by any Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, Buyer no longer owns, directly or indirectly, such Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be; and provided, further, that Seller shall be obligated to make payments to Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.06 only to the extent that the cumulative amount that would otherwise be payable by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.06(a) (notwithstanding this proviso and the succeeding proviso) exceeds the aggregate amount of the provisions for Tax liabilities reflected in the Closing Statement and taken into account in the determination of Final Working Capital; and provided, further, that the amount of any Loss determined for purposes of this Section 8.06(a) shall be determined without regard to any Tax Asset of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates other than any Company or any Subsidiary attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and     provided, further, that Seller shall not be obligated to make any payment to Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.06(a) in respect of a Loss arising from any adjustment to Taxes if the amount of such individual adjustment is less than or equal to $50,000.   (b) For purposes of this Section 8.06, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits, reliefs and rights to repayment of Tax relating to a Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies and the Subsidiaries.   (c) If Seller\'s indemnification obligation under this Section 8.06 arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then any payment by Seller to Buyer shall be an amount equal to (x) the amount otherwise due but for this subsection (c), minus (y) the present value of the Tax Benefit multiplied by the maximum federal, state or other as the case may be, corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the relevant adjustment is made or, in the case of a credit, by 100 percent. The present value referred to in the preceding sentence shall be determined using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal rate in effect at the time the relevant adjustment is made and assuming that the Tax Benefit will be used at the earliest date or dates allowable by applicable law.   (d) Any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.06 shall be made not later than 30 days after receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer stating that any Loss has been paid by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary and the amount thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.   (e) If any audit, claim, action, demand, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit) with respect of Taxes (a "Tax Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8.06 is commenced or asserted in writing against Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the     Closing, any Company or any Subsidiary, Buyer shall notify Seller of such Tax Claim promptly, and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request. Seller may discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation under this Section 8.06 by paying to Buyer the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.06, calculated on the date of such payment. Whether or not any party hereto chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Claim pursuant to this Section 8.06(e), all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of such Tax Claim; provided, however, Seller shall not, without Buyer\'s consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax Claim if such settlement could adversely affect the Tax liability of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, upon the Closing, the Company or any Subsidiary. If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller. With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a tax period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to Buyer, assume joint control with the Buyer of the defense of such Tax Claim.   (f) Seller shall not be liable under this Section 8.06 for (i) any Tax the payment of which was made without Seller\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or delayed or conditioned, or (ii) any settlements effected without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or delayed or conditioned, or resulting from any claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding with respect to which Seller was not notified pursuant to Section 8.06(e).   Section 8.07. Purchase Price Adjustment and Interest. Any amount paid by Seller or Buyer under Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   Section 8.08. Exclusivity; Survival. The provisions of this Article 8 shall be the exclusive provisions of this Agreement with respect to indemnification involving Taxes and none of the provisions of Article 11 shall apply to a claim for indemnification involving Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in Article 8 shall survive for the full period of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).       ARTICLE 9  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS   Section 9.01. Transfer of Certain Employees.

In the event that such employment is not effected, the parties acknowledge and agree that the sale of the Business will constitute a transfer for the purposes of TUPE and accordingly any of the contracts of employment of the TUPE Transferring Employees shall be transferred to the Buyer pursuant to TUPE with effect from the Closing Date which shall be the time of transfer under TUPE.   (b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall cause each of the TUPE Employers to use its reasonable efforts to keep available the services of the TUPE Transferring Employees. Specifically, Seller shall cause each of the TUPE Employers to refrain from, without Buyer\'s consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (i) making any material changes to the terms of employment of the TUPE Transferring Employees, other than in ordinary course or as set forth in Section 9.02(a) or (ii) terminating, transferring or redeploying any of the TUPE Transferring Employees, other than for cause or for reasonable business purposes or as set forth in Section 9.02(a).

Section 9.05. Preexisting Conditions and Deductibles. Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions under any medical and dental plans made available to Company Employees to be waived in respect of such employees. Buyer will use its reasonable efforts to take into account expenses incurred by Company Employees under Seller\'s medical and dental plans during the year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying deductible provisions of Buyer\'s medical and dental plans, to the extent applicable, in which Company Employees participate for such year.   Section 9.06. US Defined Contribution Plan. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the active participation of US Company Employees in the defined contribution plan in which such employees participate (the "Seller\'s 401(k) Plan") to cease as of the Closing Date.

As soon as practicable following the delivery to Buyer of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the qualified status of the Buyer\'s Plan, Seller shall cause the trustee of Seller\'s 401(k) Plan to transfer in the form of cash (or such other form as may be agreed between Buyer and Seller) the aggregate fair market value (as of the transfer date) of the account balances of US Company Employees under the Seller\'s 401(k) Plan as appropriate (the "Transferred Accounts"), to the appropriate trustee as designated by Buyer under      the trust agreement forming a part of the Buyer\'s Plan. Moreover, with respect to such Transferred Accounts, where appropriate, Buyer shall cause its plan to preserve all optional forms of benefit protected under Section 411(d)(6) of the Code and all benefits, rights and features to the extent required by Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(4)-4(d)(1).

Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any inaccuracy or breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.   Section 11.02. Indemnification. Effective at and after the Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto) ("Damages") actually suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates arising out of any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach of warranty (except representations and warranties contained in Article 8 of this Agreement) (each such misrepresentation and breach of warranty a "Warranty Breach") or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement (except covenants or agreements contained in Article 8 of this Agreement as to which the provisions of Article 8 shall govern); provided that with respect to indemnification by Seller for Warranty Breaches pursuant to this Section 11.02(a), Seller shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches exceeds 1% of Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess and Seller\'s maximum liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed      20% of Purchase Price; and (iii) no individual Warranty Breach (considering separate Warranty Breaches arising out of the same facts as one individual Warranty Breach for purposes of this clause (iii)) shall be deemed to have occurred if the actual Damages incurred as a result thereof are less than $50,000 and no such Warranty Breach shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the threshold set forth in clause (i) above has been reached . Any such maximum liability of Seller (as specified in clause (ii) above) shall not apply to the Seller\'s indemnification of Buyer in respect of Section 9.07 of this Agreement.   (b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out of any Warranty Breach or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; provided that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches pursuant to this Section 11.02(b), (i) Buyer shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches exceeds 1% of Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess and (ii) Buyer\'s maximum liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed 20% of Purchase Price; and (iii) no individual Warranty Breach shall be deemed to have occurred if the actual Damages incurred as a result thereof are less than $50,000 and no such Warranty Breach shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the threshold set forth in clause (i) above has been reached.   Section 11.03. Procedures. (a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding ("Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.   (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim asserted by any third party ("Third Party Claim") and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its expense.   (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes      injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.   (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.   (e) Each Indemnified Party shall mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party\'s reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received.   (f) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.   Section 11.04. Calculation of Damages. (9a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to fully utilize, at the highest marginal tax rate then in effect, all Tax items arising from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Damages. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.   (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) there is reflected in the Closing Statement a liability or reserve relating to such matter or (B) the      Indemnified Party is otherwise compensated for such matter pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.05, (ii) indirect, consequential, special or punitive Damages or (iii) Damages for lost profits.   Section 11.05. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.   Section 11.06. Exclusivity. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller whether in law or in equity, relating to any Company or any Subsidiary or the Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, Article 8 and Section 11.02 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than those contained in Section 2.05) or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that this Section shall not apply to claims of fraud.   ARTICLE 12  TERMINATION   Section 12.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;   (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been  consummated on or before August 31, 2006; or   (c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or  judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction.   The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses 12.01(b) or 12.01(c) shall give notice of such termination to the other party.       Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 6.01, 13.03, 13.05, 13.06 and 13.07 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.   ARTICLE 13  MISCELLANEOUS   Section 13.01. Notices.
