WHEREAS, the Shareholders own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Corporation (the "Corporation's Stock");

 

 

WHEREAS, WCI wishes to acquire from the Shareholders all of the Corporation's

WHEREAS, as a material part of this Agreement, Waste Connections of

shareholders of Land Recovery, Inc. and Resource Investments, Inc. entered
into an Equity Purchase Agreement, of even date herewith (the "Equity

49% of the total issued and outstanding membership interests of the LLC and
49% of the total issued and outstanding capital stock of the Management

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
agreements, representations, warranties, provisions and covenants herein
contained, the parties hereto, each intending to be bound hereby, agree as
follows:

 

 

1. PURCHASE OF CORPORATION'S STOCK

 

 

1.1 Shares to be Purchased. At the Closing, the Shareholders shall sell
and deliver to WCI, and WCI shall purchase from the Shareholders, all of
the Corporation's Stock in exchange for the delivery by WCI to or for the
account of the Shareholders, at the Closing, of the purchase price described
in Section 1.2 (the "Purchase Price").

 

 

1.2 Purchase Price.

 

 

(a) The Purchase Price is: two hundred three million three hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars ($203,325,000.00), (i) minus the Closing
Date Debt, (ii) plus or minus, as the case may be, that amount by which
the Effective Date Current Assets are greater

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than (the "Working Capital Surplus") or less than (the "Working
Capital Deficit") the Effective Date Current Liabilities, (iii) minus,
to account for changes in the working capital of the Corporation between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date, an amount equal to the aggregate
payments made by the Corporation (A) to the Shareholders in the form
of distributions or bonuses from the Effective Date through the Closing Date,
and (B) on the obligations constituting the Closing Date Debt from
the Effective Date through the Closing Date, (iv) plus or minus, as the
case may be, an amount equal to the Net Profit or Net Loss of the Corporation
for the period from the Effective Date through the Closing Date, plus (v)
the EBITDA between the Closing Date and November 30, 2008, if WCI causes
the Closing to occur prior to December 1, 2008 pursuant to Section 2.1. The
Shareholders shall provide good faith estimates of the amounts of each of the
items referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of this Section 1.2(a), (y)
prior to the Signing Date, as if the Closing were occurring as of such date,
and (z) at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, which
estimates shall be subject to WCI's review and confirmation as to their
accuracy and completeness. As used herein, the term "Net Profit" or
"Net Loss" shall mean the net profit or net loss of the Corporation from
the Effective Date through the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with
WCI's historical accounting practices, consistently applied. The
Purchase Price, based upon the estimates provided by the Shareholders
pursuant to clause (z) of this Section 1.2(a), shall be paid to the
Shareholders on the Closing Date, by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, in the respective percentages set forth on Schedule 3.2.

 

 

(b) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the "True Up
Date") and in any event within ten (10) business days after the True Up
Calculations are completed, WCI shall determine and provide to the
Shareholders' Representative the actual amounts of each of the items referred
to in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 1.2(a) (the "True
Up Calculations"). If the Shareholders' Representative accepts the True Up
Calculations, or if the Shareholders' Representative fails to give notice to
WCI of any objection within thirty (30) days after receipt of the True Up
Calculations, the True Up Calculations shall be the final and
binding calculation of the Purchase Price adjustments set forth in Section
1.2(c) (the "Adjustments"). If the Shareholders' Representative gives notice
to WCI of an objection to the True Up Calculations within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the True Up Calculations, WCI and the Shareholders'
Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve their differences. If
WCI and the Shareholders' Representative are able to resolve their
differences, the True Up Calculations, as modified to reflect the resolution
of the differences between WCI and the Shareholders' Representative, shall be
the final and binding calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustments. If,
however, WCI and the Shareholders' Representative are unable to resolve their
differences, WCI and the Shareholders' Representative shall submit any
disputed items to the Seattle or Tacoma office of Moss Adams LLP. The
determination of either such office of Moss Adams LLP shall be final and
binding on WCI and the Shareholders, and the True Up Calculations, as
modified to reflect (i) those differences, if any, that WCI and the
Shareholders' Representative were able to resolve, and (ii) the certified
public accountant's determination with regard to the remaining disputed
items, shall be the final and binding resolution of the Purchase Price
Adjustments.

 

 

(c) The following Purchase Price Adjustments, as applicable, shall be made
promptly after the True Up Calculations are finally determined pursuant
to Section 1.2(b):

(viii) When the Shareholders have provided a copy of the Corporation's short
year tax returns, WCI shall pay an amount equal to the Unpaid Taxes that the
Shareholders must pay with respect to such returns, if any, to the
Shareholders. If WCI disputes the amount of Taxes shown as due on such
return, it shall pay any undisputed amount and may retain the balance in

due under this Section 1.2(c)(viii), the Shareholders shall pay the final

transfer within ten (10) days after the determination thereof. Any amount
owed by the Shareholders to WCI shall be payable by the Shareholders
severally in proportion to the portion of the Purchase Price received by each
of them.

 

 

1.3 Allocation of the Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Restrictive Covenants and the assets of the Corporation as agreed

the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.2(c) shall be allocated to or
deducted from the goodwill of the Corporation. This allocation shall
be binding on the parties for federal and state income tax purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, WCI shall not be limited to the amount of the

from breach of the Restrictive Covenants by the Shareholders or their
Affiliates.

 

 

1.4 Excluded Assets. Prior to the Closing, the assets of the
Corporation listed on Schedule 1.4 (the "Excluded Assets") shall be
distributed or otherwise transferred by the Corporation to the Shareholders
or other persons, and WCI shall acquire no interest in, liability for or
claim to any of the Excluded Assets, or any Damages or Taxes associated with,

The Corporation and the Shareholders, jointly and severally, (a) represent

such representations and warranties shall survive the Closing as provided in
Section 10.4:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Washington. The Corporation has full corporate power and authority to own

the transferability of any shares of the Corporation's Stock or any equity
interest in the Corporation. The Corporation's Stock has been issued in

Corporation's Stock being acquired by WCI hereunder constitutes all of the
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation.

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and properly taken. This
Agreement and all other agreements and documents executed in connection
herewith have been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Corporation
and the Shareholders and, subject to the due authorization, execution and
delivery by WCI, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Corporation and the Shareholders enforceable against the Corporation and the

(a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium, and other laws of general application relating to or affecting

any court, administrative agency or governmental authority, or require the
approval, consent or permission of any governmental or regulatory

(c) violate the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

 

3.5 Consents Required. Except for any filings required by the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") and any consents
and approvals listed on Schedule 3.4 or 3.5 (all of which have been or will

McGladrey and Pullen. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, the
Financial Statements are true and correct in all material respects and fairly
present (a) the financial position of the Corporation as of the respective
dates of the balance sheets included in said statements; and (b) the results
of operations for the respective periods indicated. The Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with the Corporation's historical accounting
practices, applied consistently with prior periods, except that the interim
financial statements dated as of the Balance Sheet Date do not reflect any
normal year-end adjustment that could arise during an audit of such
interim financial statements, the net effect of which adjustments, in the
aggregate, will not exceed Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000). Except to the extent reflected or reserved against in
the Corporation's balance sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date or as disclosed
on Schedule 3.8 or 3.22(a) and 3.22(b), the Corporation did not have as of
the Balance Sheet Date, nor will the Corporation have as of the Closing Date,

or body before which any such Litigation is pending; (b) the date
such Litigation was instituted; (c) the parties to such Litigation; (d)

the Corporation or the Shareholders, threatened involving the Corporation (or
its officers, directors, employees or agents (while acting as an agent of
the Corporation)), the Corporation's Stock, or any of the assets, Business
or operations of the Corporation.

accrued to date have been fully paid.

 

 

(v) All of the Property Leases are in full force and effect and binding on
the parties thereto and neither the Corporation nor, to the knowledge of the
Corporation or any Shareholder, any other party to any such lease is in
breach of any of the material provisions thereof. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.4 or 3.5, the transactions contemplated herein do not constitute

and ERISA Plans do not include any Multiemployer Plans (as defined in ERISA

(iii) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17(a), neither the Corporation nor
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA with
respect to any ERISA Plan or Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied

condition exists that presents a material risk to the Corporation or any
ERISA Affiliate of incurring any liability under such Title, other than
liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"),
which payments have been or will be made when due. To the extent
this representation applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of
ERISA, it is made not only with respect to the ERISA Plans and Multiemployer
Plans, but also with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Corporation or any
current or former ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make,
contributions during any prior year.

 

 

(iv) The Corporation has not received written notice that the PBGC has
instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate any of
the ERISA Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, and, to the knowledge of the
Corporation or any Shareholder, no condition exists that presents a material
risk that such proceedings will be instituted by the PBGC.

 

 

(v) To the knowledge of the Corporation or any Shareholder, none of the
Corporation, any ERISA Affiliate, any of the ERISA Plans, any trust created
thereunder, nor to the Corporation's or any Shareholder's knowledge, any
trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction or has taken or

material liability for either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section

ERISA Plans or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of each of the ERISA Plans ended prior to the date of this
Agreement. No lien has been imposed under Section 412(n) of the Code or
Section 302(f) of ERISA on the assets of the Corporation or any ERISA
Affiliate, and, to the knowledge of the Corporation or any Shareholder, no
event or circumstance has occurred that is reasonably likely to result in the
imposition of any such lien on any such assets on account of any ERISA Plan.

 

 

(vii) With respect to any Multiemployer Plan (A) neither the Corporation nor
any ERISA Affiliate has, since September 26, 1980, made or suffered a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are
respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA and the execution of
this Agreement and the Closing will not result in any complete or partial
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, (B) no event has occurred that
presents a material risk of a complete or partial withdrawal, (C) neither the
Corporation nor any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability under
Section 4204 of ERISA, (D) no circumstances exist that present a material
risk that any such Multiemployer Plan will go into reorganization, and (E)
the aggregate withdrawal liability of the Corporation and the ERISA
Affiliates, computed as if a complete withdrawal by the Corporation and all
of its ERISA Affiliates had occurred under each such Multiemployer Plan on
the date hereof, would be zero (0).

 

 

(viii) To the knowledge of the Corporation or any Shareholder, each of the
Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Laws, including but not limited to
ERISA and the Code.

 

 

(ix) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) has
received a determination letter or has properly relied on an opinion,
notification or advisory letter from the IRS and has been timely amended as
required to maintain its tax qualified status since the date of the most
recent determination letter or opinion, notification or advisory letter. To
the knowledge of the Corporation or any Shareholder, each such Plan has been
operated in material compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code
and regulations.

 

 

(x) Any fund established under an ERISA Plan that is intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied
such requirements.

 

 

(xi) No Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (a) entitle any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Corporation or any ERISA Affiliate to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar termination payment, or
(b) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of or
otherwise enhance any benefit due any such employee, officer or director.

 

 

(xiii) There are no pending or, to the Corporation's or any Shareholder's
knowledge, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by

otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefit).

 

 

(xiv) All required notices, statements, reports and descriptions (including
Form 5500 annual reports, summary annual reports, summary plan descriptions,
and amendments thereof) have been timely filed and distributed as required by

occurred on such date, and will include, at least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, a good faith estimate of: (i) the amount of the
aggregate debt (excluding current liabilities, which shall be included in the
calculation of Effective Date Current Liabilities) of the Corporation
outstanding on the Closing Date required to be repaid by WCI or the
Corporation at or immediately after the Closing Date and all prepayment
penalties and costs incurred or to be incurred by WCI or the Corporation in
connection with the repayment of any such debt; (ii) the amount of the
aggregate debt (excluding current liabilities, which shall be included in the
calculation of Effective Date Current Liabilities) of the Corporation
outstanding on the Closing Date which will remain outstanding obligations of
the Corporation after the Closing Date, and all prepayment penalties and
costs applicable to such debt if repaid prior to maturity, including in each
case all interest accrued through and including the Closing Date; (iii) the
aggregate amount of the present value as of the Closing Date, discounted at
the lease rate factor, if known, inherent in the lease or, if the lease rate
factor is not known, at the rate charged to the Corporation by a third party
lender in connection with its most recent borrowing to finance equipment, of
all lease obligations of the Corporation that are not capitalized lease or
real property lease obligations; (iv) the aggregate amount of the present
value as of the Closing Date of all capitalized lease obligations (determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of the
Corporation; (v) the aggregate amount of all undischarged judgments against
the Corporation; (vi) the aggregate amount of all obligations secured by tax
liens against the Corporation's assets and the total of the aggregate
mortgage debt secured by the judgment liens encumbering, and the Federal tax
liens filed against, the Real Property; and (vii) the amount of the
Shareholder Expenses pursuant to Section 12.7 and Taxes payable for the
Straddle Periods as set forth in Section 9.7(b) (the amounts referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (vii) being referred to collectively
as, the "Closing Date Debt"). The Closing Date Debt listed on Schedule

Up Calculations described in Section 1.2. Schedule 3.22(a) includes, or

letters or instructions from such creditors in the form provided by WCI's

aggregate current liabilities, including without limitation trade payables,
deferred revenue, pension and profit sharing contributions, accrued vacation

interest ("Unpaid Taxes"), of the Corporation as of the Effective Date (the
"Effective Date Current Liabilities"), and (ii) the amount of the aggregate
current assets of the Corporation as of the Effective Date, including without
limitation cash, prepaid expenses the benefit of which survives the Closing
and the accounts receivable of the Corporation earned prior to the Effective
Date, and collectible (less an allowance for doubtful accounts) on or after
the Effective Date, but excluding the amount of restricted cash reflected on
the Corporation's Financial Statements related to bonds payable by the
Corporation, which shall be deducted from the calculation of Closing Date
Debt related to such bonds (the "Effective Date Current Assets"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the short-term
portion of the debt owed by the Corporation in respect of its bonds
outstanding as of the Closing Date shall be included in the calculation of
Effective Date Current Liabilities, and the long-term portion of such debt
shall be included in the calculation of Closing Date Debt. Schedule 3.22(b)
also includes a good faith estimate of the aggregate payments to be made by
the Corporation (A) to the Shareholders in the form of distributions or
bonuses from the Effective Date through the Closing Date, and (B) on the
obligations constituting the Closing Date Debt from the Effective Date
through the Closing Date. From the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing
Date, all trade payables have been incurred only in the ordinary course of

5.8 Acquisition Transactions. From the Signing Date to the earlier of
the Closing and the Termination Date, neither the Corporation nor any
Shareholder shall initiate, solicit, negotiate, encourage or provide
information to facilitate, and the Corporation and the Shareholders shall use
reasonable good faith efforts to cause any officer, director or employee of
the Corporation, or any counsel, accountant, investment banker, financial
advisor or other agent retained by it or them not to initiate, solicit,
discuss, negotiate, encourage or provide information to facilitate,
any proposal or offer to acquire all or any substantial part of the Business
or properties of the Corporation or any capital stock (including without
limitation the Corporation's Stock) of the Corporation, whether by merger,
purchase of assets or otherwise, whether for cash, securities or any other
consideration or combination thereof (any such transactions being referred to
herein as an "Acquisition Transaction"). The Corporation and the Shareholders
shall immediately notify WCI after receipt of any written proposal for an
Acquisition Transaction. Such notice to WCI shall be made orally and

5.9 Schedules.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Signing Date, the Corporation shall deliver to WCI Schedules
1.4, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.18, 3.22(a), 3.22(b) and 3.25 to this
Agreement (the "Initial Schedules") for WCI's review, and WCI shall have the
right to request revisions thereto. Within fifteen (15) days after the
Signing Date, the Corporation shall deliver all other Schedules to this
Agreement for WCI's review (the "Remaining Schedules"), and WCI shall have
the right to request revisions thereto. Nothing in any Schedule will be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein, unless the Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable
particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing on a Schedule (or
inclusion of a copy attached to a Schedule) of a document or other item will
not be deemed adequate to disclose and exception to a representation or
warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with
the existence of the document or other item itself). Any matter disclosed on
any Initial Schedule or Remaining Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed
to qualify a representation or warranty contained in Section 3, regardless of
whether such representation or warranty expressly refers to a Schedule, and
to have been disclosed on every other Schedule that refers to such Schedule
by cross reference, so long as the nature of the matter disclosed is obvious
from a fair reading of the Schedule on which the matter is disclosed. The
due diligence review of the Corporation by WCI or any of its representatives
or agents shall in no way affect or alter any of the representations and
warranties made by the Corporation or the Shareholders.

 

 

(b) From time to time after the delivery of the Initial Schedules and the
Remaining Schedules pursuant to Section 5.9(a), but not more than five (5)
business days prior to the Closing Date, the Corporation and the Shareholders
shall have the right to supplement or amend the Schedules with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the Schedules as
provided herein (the "Supplemental Material"). If the Remaining Schedules or
Supplemental Material disclose facts that, absent such disclosure, would
constitute a material breach of the Corporation's or the Shareholders'
representations or warranties, WCI shall notify the Shareholders'
Representative thereof within five (5) business days after receipt of the
applicable Remaining Schedule or Supplemental Material, and the Corporation
or the Shareholders, as applicable, shall have five (5) business days to cure
any such breach, and if not cured within such five (5) business-day period,
WCI may terminate this Agreement by delivering

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a termination notice to the Shareholders' Representative pursuant to Section
2.2(b) within five (5) days after expiration of the five (5) business-day
cure period. The termination notice must specify the representation or
warranty breached, identify the specific facts in the Remaining Schedules or
the Supplemental Material that constitute the breach, and describe why the
breach is material. If the Agreement shall not have been terminated by WCI
during such five-day (5-day) period, WCI shall have waived the right to
terminate the Agreement based on such Remaining Schedules or Supplemental
Material and to bring any action for misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant contained in this Agreement based upon such Remaining
Schedules or Supplemental Material, if true and correct, and such Remaining
Schedules and Supplemental Material, if true and correct, shall be deemed to
qualify the representation or warranty contained in Section 3 as required
hereunder in a timely manner for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

 

5.10 Leases. WCI and the applicable Shareholders shall negotiate in good
faith and agree on the terms and conditions of the Leases within thirty (30)
days after the Signing Date.

9.4 Confidentiality. Except for disclosures that are necessary for a party to
fulfill its obligations pursuant to Section 6.7 or to comply with applicable
Law (including the filing by WCI of a Form 8-K or other reports as required
by the Exchange Act), or disclosures made in connection with any legal
proceeding (subject to Section 11.1(b)), neither WCI, the Corporation nor the
Shareholders shall disclose or make any public announcement of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties. If required to make such disclosure or announcement by
applicable Law or in connection with a legal proceeding, the party making the
disclosure or announcement (to the extent commercially practicable and
legally permitted) shall provide written notice to the other parties at least
twenty-four (24) hours before such disclosure or announcement is expected to
be made.

 

 

9.5 Broker's and Finder's Fees. WCI, on the one hand, and the Shareholders on
behalf of themselves and the Corporation, on the other hand, shall pay and be
responsible for any broker's, finder's or financial advisory fee incurred by
such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

9.6 Taxes. WCI shall reasonably cooperate with the Shareholders, at the
Shareholders' expense, with respect to any matters involving the Shareholders

available to the Shareholders such files, documents, books and records of the
Corporation for inspection and copying as may be reasonably requested by the
Shareholders and shall cooperate with the Shareholders with respect to
retaining information and documents which relate to such matters.

 

 

9.7 Tax Returns.

 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Shareholders
shall prepare, at their sole cost and expense, all short year federal, state,
county, local and foreign tax returns for the period beginning with the first
day of the Corporation's fiscal year in which the Closing occurs and ending
on the Closing Date. Such returns shall (a) be prepared in a
financially responsible and conservative manner; (b) not, without WCI's prior
written consent, contain any elections that would have an adverse effect on
the financial condition or tax position of the Corporation after the Closing
Date; (c) compute any penalties and interest due with the return; (d)
 include (i) any and all dividends or distributions to any Shareholder, or
other changes in stockholders equity that occurs on or after the Closing Date
but prior to the Closing and (ii) any distributions of the Excluded Assets to
any Shareholder that occurs on or after the Closing Date but prior to the
Closing; and (e) be delivered to WCI together with all necessary
supporting schedules (including Form 8023 pursuant to Section 9.9(b)) within
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date (or at least sixty
(60) days prior to the date on which such return is required to be filed
with extensions, if earlier) for WCI's approval prior to its filing (but
such approval shall not relieve the Shareholders of their responsibility for
the Taxes assessed under these returns). The Shareholders shall
be responsible for the execution of the returns and payment of all Taxes
shown to be due or that may come to be due on such returns or otherwise
relating to the period on or prior to the Closing Date, but, to the extent
that there are any prepaid taxes in the Effective Date Current Assets or tax
reserves in the Effective

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date Current Liabilities, the Corporation shall pay such amounts towards the
Taxes due and the Shareholders shall pay any excess. The Shareholders shall
also be responsible for all Taxes arising from the conversion of the
Corporation from a cash to accrual basis of reporting and for all
Taxes attributable to "built in gains," whether due on such returns or on the
return filed by WCI or the Corporation for the period commencing after the
Closing Date. At the time of the filing of such returns, the Corporation
and the Shareholders shall each pay his, her or its share of the Taxes due
and shall contemporaneously deliver to WCI an executed copy of each such
final tax returns along with copies of payments submitted by the Shareholders
with those returns.

 

 

(b) The Corporation and Shareholders shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file all Tax Returns with respect to the Corporation for all taxable
periods that begin before and end after the Closing Date (the
"Straddle Periods"). The Shareholders shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes of the Corporation that are allocable to the pre-Closing portion of
the Straddle Periods, but to the extent that there are any prepaid taxes in
the Effective Date Current Assets or tax reserves in the Effective Date
Current Liabilities that are not used to pay the Taxes due under Section
9.7(a), the Corporation shall pay such amounts towards the Taxes due and the
Shareholders shall pay any excess. With respect to a Straddle Period, the
parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with
the relevant taxing authorities to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as
the last day of a taxable period of the Corporation. In any case where
applicable Law does not permit the Corporation to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of a taxable period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the
portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the pre-Closing portion of a
Straddle Period shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based on
income or gross receipts, the total amount of such Taxes for the period in
question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period up to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in the entire period in question, and (ii) in the
case of Taxes that are based on income or gross receipts, the Taxes that
would be due with respect to the period up to the Closing Date, if such
period were a taxable period.

 

 

9.8 General Release by Shareholders. Each Shareholder (and, if applicable,
such Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as an officer and/or director of
the Corporation) hereby fully releases and discharges the Corporation and
its directors, officers, agents and employees from all rights, claims and
actions, known or unknown, of any kind whatsoever, which such Shareholder
(and, if applicable, such Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as an
officer and/or director of the Corporation) now has against the Corporation
and its directors, officers, agents and employees, arising out of or relating
to events arising prior to or on the Closing Date, except (a) compensation
(including accrued vacation) as an employee of the Corporation for current
periods expressly described and specifically excepted from such release
on Schedule 9.8 and (b) the obligations of the Corporation to such
Shareholder that arise after the Closing Date that are disclosed on Schedule
9.8. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, each Shareholder (and, if
applicable, such Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as an officer and/or
director of the Corporation) waives any right of
indemnification, contribution or other recourse against the Corporation which
he or she now has or may hereafter have against the Corporation with respect
to representations, warranties or covenants made in this Agreement by the
Corporation.

Code and its state equivalent, if any. Each Shareholder agrees that WCI, in
its discretion, may make such election; provided, however, that such election

attorney-in-fact for the limited purposes set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Each of the Shareholders hereby appoints the Shareholders' Representative
as such Shareholder's agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, with full power
of substitution, for all purposes set forth in this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the full power and authority on such Shareholder's

all Claims hereunder; (iv) to retain legal counsel and other professional
services, at the expense of the Shareholders, in connection with the
performance by the Shareholders' Representative of this Agreement including
without limitation all actions taken on behalf of the Shareholders as an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 10.3; and (v) to do each and every act
and exercise any and all rights which such Shareholder or Shareholders are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement and the other
agreements, documents and certificates executed in connection herewith
(including without limitation initialing on the Shareholders' behalf
acceptance of WCI's disclaimers of warranty in Section 4.7). Each of the
Shareholders agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest,
are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Shareholders'
Representative and shall survive the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity of
any Shareholder.

 

 

(c) Each of the Shareholders hereby agrees that any amendment or waiver under
this Agreement, and any action taken on behalf of the Shareholders to enforce
the rights of the Shareholders under this Agreement, and any action taken
with respect to any Claim (including any action taken to object to,
defend, compromise or agree to the payment of such Claim), shall be effective
if approved in writing by the Shareholders' Representative, and that

each and every action so taken shall be binding and conclusive on every
Shareholder, whether or not such Shareholder had notice of, or approved, such
amendment or waiver.

 

 

(d) Norman LeMay shall serve as the Shareholders' Representative until he
resigns or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve. In the event that
a Shareholders' Representative resigns from such position or is otherwise
unable or unwilling to serve, the remaining Shareholders shall select, by the
vote of the holders of a majority of the Corporation's Stock immediately
prior to the Closing, a successor representative to fill such vacancy, shall
provide prompt written notice to WCI of such change and such substituted
representative shall then be deemed to be the Shareholders' Representative
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

9.11 Corporation 401(k) Plan. The Corporation currently has in place the
Harold LeMay Enterprises, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan") for
the benefit of its employees and the Corporation's Financial Statements have

WCI shall, at its sole election, either cause the Corporation to continue the
401(k) Plan after Closing in accordance with its terms for the employees of
the Corporation or request that the Shareholders (and, in such event,
the Shareholders shall) cause the Corporation to terminate the 401(k) Plan
effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Plan
Termination Date"). Such election by WCI shall be made within thirty
(30) days after the Signing Date (or such later date prior to the Closing if
a material liability is disclosed or discovered with respect to the
401(k) Plan). If WCI continues the 401(k) Plan, all amounts accrued in
the Effective Date Current Liabilities for 2008 contributions to the 401(k)
Plan shall be contributed to the 401(k) Plan to the extent permitted by the
401(k) Plan or, to the extent they are not contributed, removed from
Effective Date Current Liabilities in the True-Up Calculations and, if WCI
causes the Shareholders to terminate the 401(k) Plan immediately prior to
Closing, WCI shall allow each employee to participate in WCI's 401(k) plan
and grant each employee credit for service with the Corporation from the date
of his or her initial hiring by the Corporation for the purposes of such
plan. If WCI elects to continue the 401(k) Plan, the Shareholders shall cause
the Corporation to amend the 401(k) Plan prior to Closing to exclude any
employees of WCI or its Affiliates from becoming eligible to participate in
the 401(k) Plan on or after the Closing. If WCI requests that the 401(k) Plan
be terminated effective as of the Plan Termination Date, (i) all
amounts accrued in the Effective Date Current Liabilities for contribution to
the 401(k) Plan shall be contributed to WCI's 401(k) plan, to the extent
permitted under such plan, or paid to the employees, to the extent any
amounts exceed the contributions permitted under WCI's 401(k) plan, and no
such amounts shall appear as Effective Date Current Liabilities, (ii)
effective the day after the Closing Date, WCI shall grant each employee
credit for service with the Corporation from the date of his or her initial
hiring by the Corporation for the purposes of such employee's participation
in WCI's 401(k) plan and, until the earlier to occur of (y) December 31, 2009
and (z) the date any such employee no longer remains employed by the
Corporation, provide such employee of the Corporation with additional
compensation so that he or she is in substantially the same economic position
as if the 401(k) Plan had not been terminated, and (iii) the Shareholders
shall take all necessary actions to terminate the 401(k)Plan including, but
not limited to, the adoption by the Corporation's Board of Directors prior to
the Closing of a resolution in a form and substance satisfactory to WCI
pursuant to which:

as necessary to keep the 401(k) Plan in compliance with all applicable

be distributed to participants to the extent such distribution is consistent
with the requirements for tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the
Code and the distribution restrictions applicable under Section 401(k) of the
Code (i) as soon as administratively feasible after either the Plan
Termination Date, or (ii) if an application is made to the IRS for a letter
of determination regarding the effect of the termination of the 401(k) Plan
on its tax-qualified status, as soon as administratively feasible after
either receipt of a letter with respect to such application or, if such
application is withdrawn, the date of withdrawal.

 

 

(h) No loans shall be made by or with respect to the 401(k) Plan after the
Plan Termination Date. Participants with outstanding loans under the 401(k)

amounts so elected to the employees.

 

 

9.13 Notification of Certain Matters. The Corporation, WCI and the
Shareholders agree to give prompt notice to each other of, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to remedy (a) the occurrence or failure to
occur of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to
cause any of its or their representations or warranties in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the Closing Date, and (b)
any material failure on any such party's part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it or
them hereunder; provided, however, that, except as set forth in Section

group retrospective rating program, commonly known as the RETRO Program,
offered by the Washington Sate Department of Labor and Industries in

assign to the Shareholders or their designee all rights under the RETRO
Program to refunds payable to the Corporation in respect of premiums paid by
the Corporation, or reserved for in the Effective Date Current Liabilities
for, periods prior to the Closing Date.

to indemnification by such third party and not actually fully indemnified by
such third party and (iii) are not covered by insurance as provided
in Section 10.3(g). "Environmental Site Losses" shall mean any and all
Damages and expenditures (including, without limitation, expenses in
connection with site evaluations, risk assessments and feasibility studies),
arising out of or required by an interim or final judicial or administrative
decree, judgment, injunction, mandate, interim or final permit condition or
restriction, cease and desist order, abatement order, compliance order,
consent order, clean-up order, exhumation order, reclamation order or any
other remedial action that is required to be undertaken under any Law (that
applies to the time period during which such activities occurred) in respect
of operating activities by the Corporation to the extent occurring or arising
prior to the Closing Date on or affecting any Environmental Site, including,
but not limited to (A) any actual or alleged violation of any Law respecting
the protection of the environment that applies to the time period during
which such activities occurred, including, but not limited to, RCRA and
CERCLA if, and then only to the extent, they apply to the time period during
which such activities occurred and (B) any remedies or violations, whether by
a private or public action, alleged or sought to be assessed as a
consequence, directly or indirectly, of any Hazardous Material existing, on
or prior to the Closing from operating activities by the Corporation to the
extent occurring or arising prior to the Closing Date, at any Environmental
Site, whether or not any Release resulting from any such Hazardous Material
Release is into the air, water (including groundwater) or land and whether
such Release arose before, on or after the Closing Date. "Environmental
Site" shall mean any Facility, UST and other waste storage, processing,
treatment or disposal facility, and any other business site or other real
property owned, leased, controlled, operated or used by the Corporation or by
any predecessor thereof prior to the Closing. The term "Release" shall
mean any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying,
discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or disposing into the
ambient environment. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to
the contrary, a Release composed solely of Hazardous Material contained in
mixed municipal solid waste lawfully disposed of in a landfill during the
time the Corporation owned, operated and/or used such landfill does not
constitute an Environmental Site Loss.

 

 

(c) Any Taxes incurred or payable by the Corporation for periods on or prior
to the Closing to the extent such Taxes exceed the reserve therefor included
in Effective Date Current Liabilities, including any Taxes arising from WCI
making the tax election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code pursuant
to Section 9.9 hereof or failing to comply with ERISA or any tax
qualification rules.

 

 

(d) Any amount owed by the Corporation that exceeds the reserve therefor
included in Effective Date Current Liabilities arising from or related to (i)
any employee wages, pension or other benefits due to or required to be
contributed in respect of any employees, directors or other service providers
of the Corporation on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) any
withdrawal liability due to any partial or complete withdrawal occurring on
or before the Closing Date.

 

 

(e) Any Excluded Liabilities, whether arising prior to, on or after the
Closing Date.

(f) Any liability based on, attributable to or resulting from any
indemnification agreements, guarantees, suretyships, obligations to assure or
incur any obligation of a Shareholder provided by the Corporation.

 

 

(g) Any actions, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, demands, assessments,
adjustments, costs and expenses (including specifically, but without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation)
incident to any of the foregoing.

 

 

10.2 Limitations on the Shareholders' Indemnities.

 

 

(a) The obligation of the Shareholders to indemnify the Indemnitees as
provided in Section 10.1 shall only apply after the aggregate amount of
such obligations exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "General
Deductible Amount"), at which time the indemnification obligations shall
be effective as to all amounts on first dollar basis. Any Claim (as defined
in Section 10.3 below) not exceeding Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)
in value (the "Minimum Claim Amount") shall be considered de minimis and the
Shareholders shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee for such
Claim. In addition, Claims under the Minimum Claim Amount shall not be
aggregated with respect to the General Deductible Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the General Deductible Amount and the Minimum Claim Amount shall
not apply to any indemnification obligations related to, based on or arising
in connection with any fraud or Misconduct or any breach or non-performance
of any of the Absolute Obligations. For purposes of this Agreement, "Absolute
Obligations" mean any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any
of Sections 3.1 through 3.4, 3.18, 3.22 (without duplication as to amounts
resolved through the True Up Calculations), 3.25, 3.32, 3.33, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9
or 11.1 hereof or the obligations of the Corporation or the Shareholders
pursuant to Sections 10.1(c) through 10.1(g) hereof. In the event that a
representation contained in this Agreement is breached and such
representation is qualified by words or phrases such as "material,"
"materially," "immaterial," "immaterially," "nonmaterial," "substantially,"
or words of similar import, such qualifiers shall be disregarded for purposes
of determining if a breach occurred or calculating the amount of any
obligation of indemnity arising pursuant to this Section 10. Notwithstanding
the disclosure contained on any Schedule to qualify any representation or
warranty related to any Absolute Obligation (other than a disclosure on
Schedule 3.4 or 3.25 to qualify any representation or warranty contained in
Section 3.4 (except for subsection (c) thereof) or 3.25), any Damages
resulting from the subject matter so disclosed shall be subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 on the same basis as any other
Absolute Obligation.

 

 

(b) Except for fraud, the maximum amount that the Indemnitees can recover for
Claims as a result of one or more Indemnity Events pursuant to the provisions
hereof (including those based upon Misconduct or Absolute Obligations, or the
breach or non-performance thereof) from any Shareholder shall not in the
aggregate exceed the amount of consideration such Shareholder receives under
this Agreement. Further, except for fraud or Misconduct and except
with respect to Claims based on or arising in connection with any of the
Absolute Obligations, or the breach or non-performance thereof, the maximum
amount that the Indemnitees can recover from the Shareholders for such other
Claims as a result of one or more Indemnity Events pursuant to the provisions
hereof shall not in the aggregate exceed (for the applicable period the
"Maximum Claim Limit") (i) as to any Claims for which a Claims Notice

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

was given before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Forty-Five
Million Dollars ($45,000,000), (ii) as to any Claims for which a Claims
Notice was given on or after the first, and before the second, anniversary of
the Closing Date, the excess of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) over any
amounts recovered from Shareholders for Indemnity Events applicable to any
Claims for which a Claims Notice was given before the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, and (iii) as to any Claims for which a Claims Notice was
given on or after the second, and before the third, anniversary of the
Closing Date, the excess of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) over any
amounts recovered from Shareholders for Indemnity Events applicable to any
Claims for which a Claims Notice was given before the second anniversary of
the Closing Date. Except for fraud, the maximum amount that the Indemnitees
can recover from any Shareholder, for Claims as a result of one or more
Indemnity Events subject to the Maximum Claim Limit pursuant to
the provisions hereof, shall not in the aggregate exceed such Shareholder's
pro rata share of the applicable Maximum Claim Limit based upon the
respective percentages of the Corporation's Stock owned by such Shareholder
set forth on Schedule 3.2. For the purposes of this Section 10, "Misconduct"
shall mean willful misconduct, misappropriation or intentional or
knowing misrepresentation or concealment.

 

 

10.3 Claims. In the event that any claim ("Claim") is hereafter asserted
against or arises with respect to any Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee
may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitee shall notify the
Shareholders' Representative on behalf of each and all of the Shareholders
(the "Indemnifying Party"), in writing thereof (the "Claims Notice") within
sixty (60) days after (i) receipt of written notice of commencement of any
third party litigation against such Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"); (ii)
receipt by such Indemnitee of written notice of any Third Party
Claim pursuant to an invoice, notice of claim or assessment against such
Indemnitee; or (iii) such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any
other event in respect of which indemnification may be sought from the
Indemnifying Party (including, without limitation, any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty or breach of any covenant). The Claims Notice
shall describe the Claim and the specific facts and circumstances in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount, if known, or an estimate,
if possible, of the losses that have been or may be incurred or suffered by
the Indemnitee.

 

 

(a) Defense by Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee) if the Indemnifying Party provides written notice of its election
to assume such defense within ten (10) days after the Indemnifying Party has
received a Claims Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim and such
Third Party Claim is solely for money damages and the cumulative total of all
Claims (including such Claim) does not exceed the limit set forth in Section
10.2(b) at the time the Claim is made; provided, however, the Indemnifying
Party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently in order to preserve the Indemnifying Party's rights and rights of
the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee may participate, at the Indemnitee's own
expense, in the defense of any Claim assumed by the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(b) Defense by Indemnitee. If, within 10 days of the Indemnifying
Party's receipt of a Claims Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall not have
elected to defend the Third Party Claim or if in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnitee the Indemnifying Party fails to adequately defend the Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control of the defense and/or compromise of such Claim, and the costs and
expenses of such defense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be
added to the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and in any event
within 10 days after demand therefor, reimburse the Indemnitee for the costs
of defending the Claim, including attorneys' fees and expenses.

 

 

(c) Cooperation. The party assuming the defense of any Claim shall keep the
other party reasonably informed at all times of the progress and development
of its or their defense of and compromise efforts with respect to such Claim
and shall furnish the other party with copies of all relevant pleadings,
correspondence and other papers. In addition, the parties to this Agreement
shall cooperate with each other and make available to each other and their
representatives all available relevant records or other materials required by
them for their use in defending, compromising or contesting any Claim.
Subject to Section 10.4, the failure to timely deliver a Claims Notice or
otherwise notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such actions
in accordance with this Section 10.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from the obligation to indemnify hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party establishes by competent evidence that it has been
prejudiced thereby.

 

 

(d) No Consent to Judgment. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-
Party Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), provided that the Indemnifying
Party may consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into a settlement if
the judgment or proposed settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of
all liability of each Indemnitee with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
and (ii) involves only the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying
Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnitee or impose any restrictions on the operation of the business of the
Indemnitee or Affiliates of the Indemnitee. So long as the Indemnifying Party
has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in
accordance with Section 10.3(a), the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying
Party).

 

 

(e) Conflicts of Interest. In the event both the Indemnitee and
the Indemnifying Party are named as defendants in an action or proceeding
initiated by a third party, they shall both be represented by the same
counsel (on whom they shall reasonably agree), unless such counsel, the
Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party shall determine that such counsel has a
conflict of interest in representing both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying
Party in the same action or proceeding and the Indemnitee and the
Indemnifying Party do not waive such conflict to the satisfaction of such
counsel.

 

 

(f) Service of Process. The Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Third Party Claim is
brought against any Indemnitee for purposes of any Claim that an Indemnitee
may have under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim or the
matters alleged therein, and agree that process may be served on the
Indemnifying Parties with respect to such claim anywhere in the world at the
address set forth in, or determined pursuant to, Section 12.4.

HLE

(g) Insurance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
party shall be entitled to indemnification or other remedy with respect to
any Damages for which insurance proceeds are available from occurrence-based
policies that were obtained by the Corporation and in effect prior to the
Closing Date (but only to the extent of the net proceeds actually received by
the Indemnitee).

 

 

(h) Exclusive Remedy. Except for fraud, the indemnification provisions
of this Section 10 shall be the exclusive remedy for any Claim by an
Indemnitee for monetary damages arising under this Agreement or from the
transactions contemplated hereby provided that nothing in this Section 10
shall be deemed to be the exclusive remedy or shall limit the remedies of any
party with respect to the breach or nonfulfillment by any party of any other
obligation or covenant in this Agreement, or any of the agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or entered into pursuant hereto, that is
required to be satisfied or fulfilled after the Closing Date. In addition,
the parties shall be entitled to pursue any claims for non-monetary relief to
which they may be entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Indemnification
Obligations. The representations and warranties of the parties contained in
this Agreement and in any certificate, Exhibit or Schedule delivered pursuant
hereto, or in any other writing delivered pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, other than the Equity Purchase Agreement, the liability of the
party making such representations and warranties for breaches thereof, and
the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders under Section 10.1, shall
survive the Closing and expire on the later of the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date or, as to any Claim for which a Claims Notice was given
before such date, the final resolution of such Claim, except in the case of
any Claim related to, based on or arising in connection with any fraud or
Misconduct or any breach or non-performance of any Absolute Obligations as to
which such liabilities and indemnification obligations shall expire thirty
(30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(irrespective of the date of discovery). The parties hereto in executing and
delivering and in carrying out the provisions of this Agreement are relying
solely on the representations, warranties, Schedules, Exhibits, agreements
and covenants contained in this Agreement, or in any writing or document
delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, and not upon any
representation, warranty, agreement, promise or information, written or oral,
made by any person other than as specifically set forth herein or therein.

 

 

10.5 No Exhaustion of Remedies or Subrogation; Right of Setoff. Each
Shareholder waives any right to require any Indemnitee to (a) proceed against
the Corporation, any other Shareholder or any other person; or (b) pursue any
other remedy whatsoever in the power of any Indemnitee. WCI may, but shall
not be obligated to, set off against any and all payments due any Shareholder
any amount to which any Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder
with respect to any Indemnity Event. Such right of set off shall be separate
and apart from any and all other rights and remedies that the Indemnitees may
have against any Shareholders or their successors. No consent of any
Shareholder shall be required for any assignment or reassignment of the
rights of WCI or the Corporation under this Section 10.

group that controls, such business and provided, further, that such
Shareholder or Affiliates does not, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly,

thereafter; provided,

however, that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such

Period shall be extended by the number of days in any period in which such
Shareholder or Affiliate thereof is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be in default or breach of this Section 11.1.

 

 

(b) Confidential Information. Each of the Shareholders and their
Affiliates shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall
not use for the benefit of themselves or others, all data and information
relating to the Business ("Confidential Information"), including, without
limitation, know-how, trade secrets, customer lists, vehicle routing,
supplier lists, details of contracts, pricing policies, operational methods,
marketing plans or strategies, bidding information, practices, policies or

respective Affiliates, to leave the employ of the Corporation or its
Affiliates and join any Shareholder or any of their Affiliates in any
business endeavor owned or pursued by any Shareholder, nor shall any
Shareholder hire any employee of the Corporation, WCI or any of
their respective Affiliates within sixty (60) days after such employee's

terminates for any reason except for any Shareholders and their Affiliates
who may also be employed by the Corporation, WCI or their respective
Affiliates.

 

 

(d) No Disparagement. From and after the date hereof, neither
the Shareholders, on the one hand, nor WCI, on the other hand, shall, in any
way or to any person or entity or governmental or regulatory body or agency,
denigrate or derogate the others or any of such others' Affiliates, or any
officer, director, employee, product, service or procedure of any such
company or others whether or not such denigrating or derogatory statements
shall be true and whether or not such statements are based on acts or
omissions which are learned by any

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party after the date hereof or on acts or omissions which occur after the
date hereof, or otherwise. This paragraph does not apply to the extent that
testimony is required by legal or regulatory process, provided that the party
required to give such testimony gives the other party not less than five (5)
days' prior written notice of such proposed testimony. In addition to all
other rights and remedies under applicable Law, the parties shall be entitled
to have the provisions of this Section 11.1(d) specifically enforced by a
court of competent jurisdiction and to injunctive relief to enforce the terms
of this Section 11.1(d) and to restrain the other parties from any violation
hereof.

 

 

11.2 Rights and Remedies On Breach. If any Shareholder or Affiliate thereof
breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of
Section 11.1 (the "Restrictive Covenants"), WCI shall have the following
rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent
of the others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to WCI at law or
in equity:

 

 

(a) Specific Performance. Each Shareholder agrees that any breach
or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable
injury to WCI and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy
to WCI. Accordingly, in addition to any other rights or remedies, WCI shall
be entitled to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and to injunctive relief to enforce the
terms of the Restrictive Covenants and to restrain such Shareholder or
Affiliate from any violation thereof.

 

 

(b) Accounting. The right and remedy to require each Shareholder to account
for and pay over to WCI all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,
increments or other benefits derived or received by a Shareholder as the
result of any transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive
Covenants.

 

 

(c) Severability of Covenants. Each Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that
the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and valid in prohibited business
activity and geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If
the business activities, period of time or geographical area covered by the
Restrictive Covenants should be deemed too extensive by any court, then the
parties intend that the Restrictive Covenants be construed to cover the
maximum scope of business activities, period of time and geographical area
(not exceeding those specifically set forth herein), if any, as may be
permissible under applicable Law.

 

 

(d) Blue-Penciling. If any court determines that any of the Restrictive
Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the scope of the
business activities covered, the duration or the geographic area, such court
shall reduce the scope, duration or area of such provision, as the case may
be, to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable and, in its
reduced form, such provision shall then be enforced.

 

 

(e) Enforceability in Jurisdiction. WCI and the Shareholders intend to and
hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants on the courts
of any jurisdiction within the geographic scope of the
Restrictive Covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such
jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants unenforceable by reason of
the breadth

 

 

 

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

HLE

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of such scope or otherwise, such determination shall not bar or in any way
affect WCI's right to the relief provided above in the courts of any other
jurisdiction within the geographic scope of the Restrictive Covenants as to
breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions,
such covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose,
severable into diverse and independent covenants.

 

 

12. GENERAL

 

 

12.1 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto, the successors or assigns of WCI and the
heirs, legal representatives or assigns of the Shareholders; provided,
however, that any such assignment shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement and shall not relieve the assignor of its, his or her
responsibilities under this Agreement. Neither any Shareholder nor WCI shall
assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties, provided that WCI shall have the right to transfer or
assign this Agreement to an Affiliate, but such transfer or assignment will
not relieve WCI of any liability or responsibility under this Agreement.

 

 

12.2 Public Announcements. Except as required by Law, no party shall
make any public announcement or filing with respect to the transactions
provided for herein prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto.

 

 

12.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

12.5 Applicable Law; Attorneys' Fees. Except as otherwise stated, this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Washington without giving effect to its conflict of laws
provisions. In the event of any dispute or controversy between WCI on the one
hand and the Corporation or the Shareholders on the other hand relating to
the interpretation of this Agreement or to the transactions contemplated
hereby, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other
party reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing
party, as awarded by the court. Such award shall include post-judgment
attorney's fees and costs and those on any appeal.

 

 

12.6 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Misconduct or Fraud. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary other than the limitation set forth in
Section 10.2(b), the liability of any party under this Agreement shall be in
addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may
have at law or equity based on such party's Misconduct or fraud.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary other than the
limitation set forth in Section 10.2(b), none of the provisions set forth in
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any
right or remedy which such party may have at law or equity based on any other
party's Misconduct or fraud, nor shall any such provisions limit, or be
deemed to limit (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such
claim for Misconduct or fraud; (b) the time period during which such a claim
for Misconduct or fraud may be brought, or (c) the recourse which any such
party may seek against another party with respect to such a claim for
Misconduct or fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
shall allow any party to recover more than once for damages or claims based
on the same set of circumstances.

 

 

12.7 Payment of Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions herein
contemplated shall be consummated, each party hereto will pay its own fees,
expenses and disbursements incurred in connection herewith and all other
costs and expenses incurred in the performance and compliance with all
conditions to be performed hereunder (including, in the case of the
Shareholders, any such fees, expenses and disbursements paid or accrued by,
or charged to, the Corporation). The portion of the real estate excise Taxes
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that is calculated based upon the book value of all real estate owned by the
Corporation (that is not an Excluded Asset) shall be jointly and severally
borne by the Shareholders and paid when due (collectively, the "Shareholder

Expenses"); provided, however, that WCI shall bear and pay when due (i) the
portion of the real estate excise Taxes incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is calculated based upon the
excess of the value allocated to such real estate owned by the
Corporation (that is not an Excluded Asset) on Schedule 1.3 over the
Corporation's book value for such real estate, (ii) the title insurance
premiums and all other costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the
Title Policies and (iii) the fees and other costs incurred in connection with
filing the Notification and Report Form under, and compliance with, the HSR
Act.

 

 

12.8 Incorporation by Reference. All Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto
are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth at each
point referred to in this Agreement.

 

 

12.9 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part hereof or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

12.10 Number and Gender of Words. Whenever the singular number is used
herein, the same shall include the plural where appropriate, and shall apply
to all of such number, and to each of them, jointly and severally, and words
of any gender shall include each other gender where appropriate.

 

 

12.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto constitute the
entire agreement and understanding between the Corporation, the
Shareholders and WCI and supersede any prior agreement and understanding
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
modified or amended only by a written instrument executed or approved by the
Corporation, the Shareholders and WCI.

 

 

12.12 Waiver. No waiver by any party hereto at any time of any breach of, or
compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed
by any other party hereto may be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar
provisions or conditions at the same time or at any prior or subsequent time.

 

 

12.13 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibited
unenforceability. The remaining provisions of this Agreement shall otherwise
remain in full force and effect and any such prohibition or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

 

12.14 Construction. The language in all parts of this Agreement must be in
all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for
or against any party. Unless expressly stated otherwise, "including"
means "including but not limited to" and all references herein to a "day" are
deemed to be a reference to a calendar day, and all references to "business
day" mean any day of the year other than a Saturday, Sunday or a public or
bank holiday in State of Washington or California. Unless expressly stated
otherwise, cross-references herein refer to provisions within this Agreement
and are not references to the overall

knowledge which should have been obtained by any such person on reasonable
inquiry by a reasonable business person, and whenever reference is made to
