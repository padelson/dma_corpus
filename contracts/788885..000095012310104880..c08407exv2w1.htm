ARTICLE II. 

   

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Acquisition Subsidiary: 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Subsidiary_. Each issued and outstanding
share of capital stock of Acquisition Subsidiary shall be converted into and
become 100 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, [no par
value per share], of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Acquirer-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned directly by the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, Acquirer or Acquisition Subsidiary shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor. 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.01(d), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to TWENTY-NINE DOLLARS ($29.00) (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend or combination of
stock that may occur from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be deemed outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration and any
regular quarterly dividend declared in accordance with Section 5.01(b)(i)(A)
but unpaid as of the Closing Date upon surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissenters  Shares_") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Dissenters Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Sections 293-A:13.01 through 293-A:13.31 of the NHBCA (the " _Dissenters 
Rights Provisions_") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather, the holders of Dissenters Shares
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenters Shares
in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Provisions; provided, however, that
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under the Dissenters Rights Provisions, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenters Shares shall cease and such Dissenters Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest, upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02. The Company
shall give the Acquirer (i) prompt notice of any demand for payment of fair
value received by the Company, the withdrawal of any such demand, and any
other instrument served pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Provisions and
received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any demand for payment of fair value under
the Dissenters Rights Provisions. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Acquirer, make any payment with respect to any
demand for payment of fair value or offer to settle or settle any
such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

(e) _Company Stock Options_. The Acquirer and the Company agree that, in
accordance with the provisions of the Company Stock Option Plans (as defined
in Section 3.11(c)) and a resolution of the Company Board adopted under
Section 10 thereof, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase
Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Option Plans shall be accelerated
so that each such option outstanding and unexercised as of the fifth (5th)
business day preceding the scheduled Effective Time shall become fully vested
and exercisable from such date until the Effective Time. Any option to
purchase Company Common Stock exercised by the holder thereof prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.01(c), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by Law, and further reduced by any amount owed pursuant to any
exercise of said option. Upon the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Company Common Stock that has not previously been exercised shall
be terminated and, in exchange therefor, each holder of each such option
outstanding and unexercised shall receive from the Surviving Corporation not
more than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time an amount in cash
(less any withholding of taxes required by Law) equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
option multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration less the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such option, if any.
In the event and to the extent that the Company Stock Option Plans permit or
require the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to exercise discretion
with respect to outstanding stock options, the Company Board (or such
committee, as the case may be) will not exercise any such discretion. 

  

(f) _Declared but Unpaid Dividends_. In addition to the Merger Consideration,
Acquirer shall pay or cause to be paid together with the Merger Consideration
any regular quarterly dividend declared in accordance with Section 5.01(b)
but unpaid as of the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer shall select a bank
or trust company in the United States, reasonably acceptable to the Company,
to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing Company Common
Stock and Acquirer shall take all steps necessary to provide, or to enable and
cause the Acquisition Subsidiary to provide, to the Paying Agent prior to the
Effective Time any and all of the cash necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five (5) business days following such date), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Acquirer may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Acquirer that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01. If any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be unable to surrender such holders Certificates because such
Certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver
in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity bond in form and substance and
with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquirer, upon demand,
and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Acquirer for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Acquirer, Acquisition Subsidiary, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or counsel, shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Acquirer shall cause the Paying Agent to
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund on a daily basis; provided that
such investments shall be limited to (i) direct obligations of the United
States, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
or (iii) certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank the deposits of
which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and which is
"well-capitalized" within the meaning of applicable regulations. Any interest

Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign company to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly

organization of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage of each Company
Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or membership interests owned by the
Company, another Company Subsidiary or any third party along with a list

exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of any capital stock or other
ownership interests of any Company Subsidiary, and there are no
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which Company or
any of Company Subsidiaries is or may be bound to issue, redeem, purchase or
sell additional shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of any
Company Subsidiary. The Company does not directly or indirectly own
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or

to preemptive rights, and all such shares are owned by the Company or another
Company Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, taking actions, agreements, limitations in the Companys voting

Occupational and Safety Health Act of 1970, as amended, and the regulations

Effect, any provision of Law or Order regarding the terms and conditions of
employment of employees, former employees, or prospective employees or other

except Liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such Liens or other
imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value of
or interfere with the present use of the property affected thereby or which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, all leases pursuant to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries leases from others
material amounts of real or personal property, are in good standing, valid
and effective in accordance with their respective terms and there is not, To
the Knowledge of the Company, under any of such leases, any existing default
or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default), except where the lack of such good
standing, validity and effectiveness or the existence of such default would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

Section 3.14 _Real and Personal Property_. 

  

Except for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect: 

  

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or have sufficient rights and
consents to use under existing franchises, leases, easements and license
agreements all real property (including all buildings, fixtures and other
improvements thereto) necessary for the conduct of their businesses and
operations as currently conducted; and all such property is in good condition
and repair and is suitable in all material respects for the purpose for which
it is now being used in the conduct of the businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, To
the Knowledge of the Company, neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has any material capital improvements, capital expenditures or alterations to
any of their respective real properties or facilities required by applicable
health and safety, water quality or other Laws except as set forth on Section

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The water supplied by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to their
respective customers complies with all applicable standards for quality,
quantity and safety of water imposed by applicable Laws and Orders, except

the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

Section 3.16 _Regulation as a Utility_. 

  

The Company Subsidiaries set forth in Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (" _Regulated Company Subsidiaries_ ") are regulated as public
utilities in New Hampshire only. Neither the Company nor any Company

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them, except for any Tax Returns as to which the
failure to file, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, all such filed Tax
Returns are complete and correct in all material respects. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have paid and discharged all Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns in connection with or with respect to the periods or
transactions covered by such Tax Returns and have paid all other Taxes as are
due, except such as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings (to the extent that any such proceedings are
required) and except as may be determined to be owed upon completion of
any Tax Return not yet filed based upon an extension of time to file, and
there are no other Taxes that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect if
asserted by a taxing authority, except with respect to which the Company is
maintaining reserves to the extent currently required. All tax reserves that
the Company is maintaining are set forth on Section 3.17(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. There are no Tax Liens on any assets of the Company or

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation_. 

  

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action knowingly to
facilitate, any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonable be
expected to constitute, a Company Alternative Proposal; (ii) enter into,
maintain, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect to,
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to constitute, a
Company Alternative Proposal, or in response to any inquiries or proposals
that may reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Alternative Proposal,
except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.02; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any
Company Alternative Proposal; (iv) authorize or permit any of its or its
Subsidiaries representatives to take any such action; or (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing
for any Company Alternative Proposal (except as contemplated by
Section 8.02(h) and except for confidentiality agreements permitted under
Section 5.02(b)). Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company shall not release
any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party. The Company shall, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Subsidiaries
representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any parties that may have been conducted
heretofore with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) with respect
to third parties with whom discussions or negotiations have been terminated
on or prior to the date of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the return or the destruction of, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement, confidential information previously
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives,
and (iii) cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible
to or by any person other than Acquirer and its Affiliates. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Company will promptly notify Acquirer orally (and then in writing
within 24 hours) after it or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting a Company
Alternative Proposal, any request for discussions or negotiations, or any
request for information relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries in
connection with a Company Alternative Proposal or a potential Company
Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records
thereof of which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives is or become aware, or any amendments to the
foregoing. Such notice to Acquirer shall indicate the identity of the person
making such proposal and the terms and conditions of such proposal, if any.
The Company shall also promptly provide Acquirer with (i) a copy of any
written notice or other written communication from any person informing the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their respective representatives that
it is considering making, or has made a proposal regarding, a Company
Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy or any Company Alternative Proposal (or any
amendment thereof) received by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and
(iii) such other details of any such Company Alternative Proposal that
Acquirer may reasonably request. Thereafter, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) keep Acquirer reasonably informed on a current
basis of any change to the terms of any such Company Alternative
Proposal. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.02(a) and
subject to compliance with this Section 5.02(b), if the Company receives a
Company Alternative Proposal (that did not arise or result from any breach of
this Section 5.02) at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (i) which constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, or
(ii) which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, could reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of
the actions referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) below, in a Company
Superior Proposal, the Company may take any or all of the following actions:
(x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (and any persons working
in concert with such third party and to their respective potential financing
sources and representatives) making any such Company Alternative Proposal, if,
and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives
from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements
shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate
with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from
satisfying its obligations under this Agreement and shall contain a
standstill provision substantially similar to the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such provisions remain in effect (it
being agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
particular standstill provision to the extent the Company irrevocably and
simultaneously releases Acquirer from such corresponding standstill
provision)); (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
(and such other persons) with respect to the Company Alternative Proposal;
and (z) release any third party from, or waive any provision of, a
confidentiality or standstill provision to which it is a party if, in the
case of this clause (z), the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary under
applicable Law in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.02, the Company Board
shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
in a manner adverse to Acquirer, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company
Alternative Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Company Alternative
Proposal (any event or action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a "
_Company Change of Recommendation_ "). 

  

(d) In response to the receipt of a Company Alternative Proposal (that did not
arise or result from a breach of this Section 5.02) that has not been
withdrawn, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may effect a Company Change of Recommendation but only if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Company
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (y)
effecting a Company Change of Recommendation is required for the Company
Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company and
its stockholders under applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit or restrict the Company Board, in circumstances not involving or
relating to a Company Alternative Proposal, from amending, modifying or
withdrawing the Company Recommendation to the extent that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that such action is necessary under applicable Law in order for the
directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders. 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors, such disclosure is required in order for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligation, or is otherwise
required, under applicable Law. 

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean
any unsolicited, bona fide, written proposal or any unsolicited bona fide,
written offer made by any Person (other than a proposal or offer by Acquirer
or any of its Affiliates) relating to: (i) any merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other business combination transaction, or a "merger of
equals," in each case involving the Company; (ii) the acquisition by any
Person or "group" of Persons, directly or indirectly, of twenty percent (20%)
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iii)
the acquisition by any Person or "group" of Persons of twenty percent (20%)
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company; or (iv) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or
group of Persons beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company. 

  

(g) As used in this Agreement " _Company Superior Proposal_ ," shall mean a
Company Alternative Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal
counsel and after taking into account relevant financial, legal, regulatory,
estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and
the person or group making such proposal, is more favorable to the Company
and its stockholders than the Merger. For purposes of the definition of "
_Company Superior Proposal,"_ each reference to 20% in the definition of "
_Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall be replaced with "50%." 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(h) unless and until:
(x) the Company has promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) provided a written notice to Acquirer (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_
") advising Acquirer that the Company has received a Company Alternative
Proposal and specifying the information required by Section 5.02(b) and
including written notice of the determination of the Company Board that the
Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; (y) the
Company has provided Acquirer with an opportunity, for a period of five (5)
business days from the date of delivery to Acquirer of the Superior Proposal
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ "), to amend (the " _Right to Match_ ") the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, including an increase
in, or modification of, the Merger Consideration (any such proposed
transaction, a " _Revised Transaction_ "), such that the Company Superior
Proposal no longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; and (z)(1) during
such Notice Period, the Company and its representatives negotiate in good
faith with Acquirer and its representatives with respect to such Revised
Transaction and (2) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board, has
determined that the Company Superior Proposal continues to be a Company
Superior Proposal notwithstanding the Revised Transaction and taking into
account all amendments and proposed changes made thereto during the Notice
Period. 

   

Section 5.03 _Company Stock Option Plans_. 

  

The Company shall take all action necessary to implement the measures set
forth in Section 2.01(e) with respect to the Company Stock Option Plans. 

  

ARTICLE VI. 

   

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  

   

Section 6.01 _Rights Agreement_. 

  

The Company Board shall take all action reasonably requested in writing by
Acquirer in order to render the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except as approved in writing by Acquirer,
the Company Board shall not (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement, (ii)
redeem the Rights, or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make
any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, in each case that
would adversely affect the ability of Acquirer or Acquisition Subsidiary to
effect the Merger on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that an amendment to the Company Rights
Agreement solely to extend the term of the Company Rights Agreement in
accordance with its terms would not adversely affect the ability of the
Acquirer or Acquisition Subsidiary to effect the Merger. 

   

Section 6.02 _Eminent Domain Agreement_. 

  

The parties acknowledge that they have agreed to resolve and settle the
eminent domain dispute pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

(a) Acquirer shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Acquirer Governing Body for the purpose of
taking action by an affirmative vote of not less than ten (10) members of the
Acquirer Governing Body (i) to approve and ratify, pursuant to NH RSA 38:13
the issuance of bonds and notes necessary to defray the costs to be incurred
by Acquirer to consummate the Merger pursuant to this Agreement (if so
approved and ratified, the " _Acquirer Ratification Vote_ "), and (ii) to
make the findings required by the Special Legislative Authority (if so made,
the _"Acquirer Special Findings Vote"_ ). 

  

(b) After both the Acquirer Ratification Vote and the Acquirer Special
Findings Vote are obtained, Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain the financing contemplated by the Acquirer Ratification
Vote (the " _Financing_ "). Acquirer shall prepare necessary documentation
reasonably required to effect the Financing, including any official
statements (provided that the Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such official statements
prior to their finalization). 

  

(c) Acquirer shall notify the Company promptly of the receipt of any
information concluding that there is a substantial reason to believe that the
Financing contemplated by the Acquirer Ratification Vote cannot be
obtained. 

   

Section 6.04 _Regulatory Matters_. 

  

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercial best efforts promptly to prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings,
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger). Acquirer and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on, in each case subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Acquirer or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 6.04(a), " _Governmental
Entity_ " shall not include the Acquirer Governing Body. 

  

(b) Acquirer and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Acquirer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Acquirer and the Company shall promptly furnish each other with copies of
written communications received by Acquirer or the Company, as the case may

_Governmental Entity_ " shall not include the Acquirer Governing Body. 

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties shall cooperate with each other
and use their commercial best efforts to prepare promptly a petition with the
NHPUC to obtain as promptly as practicable all approvals of the NHPUC which
are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and further, the
parties intend that such petition to the NHPUC shall reflect the intent of
Acquirer as of the Effective Time (i) to operate, conduct and manage the
businesses of the Regulated Company Subsidiaries as "public utilities" within
the meaning of NHRSA Chapter 362 in the ordinary course consistent in all
material respects with prior regulatory status and operating practice of each
of the Regulated Company Subsidiaries, and (ii) to include in the rate base
of the Regulated Company Subsidiaries an acquisition premium to be recovered
through rates with a return that, together with other components of the rates
of the Regulated Company Subsidiaries, will be sufficient to enable Acquirer
to satisfy all operating and debt service costs of the Regulated Company
Subsidiaries and Acquirers obligations under the Financing. 

   

Section 6.05 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. 

  

(a) The Company shall, at such time after both the Acquirer Ratification Vote
and the Acquirer Special Findings Vote are obtained as the Company shall
determine in its reasonable discretion, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement relating to the approval of the Merger at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, meeting the requirements of SEC Schedule 14A (the " _Proxy Statement_
"), in preliminary form (provided that Acquirer and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
prior to its filing with the SEC), and each of the Company and Acquirer and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto.
The Company shall notify Acquirer promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Acquirer with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Company shall, at such time after the Acquirer Ratification Vote and
the Acquirer Special Findings Vote are obtained as the Company shall
determine in its reasonable discretion, take all action necessary in
accordance with the NHBCA and the Company Charter and the Company By-Laws to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and
subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.05(b), for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") and, subject to Section 5.02(c) or (d), shall include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendations of its Board of Directors that its
stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company Recommendation_ ").
Subject to Section 5.02, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger.
Neither the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Company of any Company Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Company
Superior Proposal), nor any furnishing of information, discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto, nor any decision or action by the Company
Board to effect a Company Change of Recommendation shall give the Company any
right to delay, defer or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the Companys stockholders or to permit the dissemination of information
which is material to stockholders voting at the Company Stockholders Meeting,
or, if as of the time the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or for
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. 

   

Section 6.06 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.06(b) below, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, afford to Acquirer, and to Acquirers officers,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors, underwriters, financing sources,
subcontractors and other representatives, upon reasonable notice by Acquirer
to any of the Companys executive officers, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to, furnish promptly to Acquirer such information concerning its
business, properties, assets, customers, consultants and personnel
as Acquirer may reasonably request; provided, however, that (i) direct access
to personnel below the executive officer level shall be provided as
reasonably determined by one or more of the executive officers of the
Company, and (ii) the Company may withhold the documents and information
described in Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent
required to comply with the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided further, that the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable,
any consent from such third party required to permit the Company to furnish
such documents and information to Acquirer. Subject to Section 6.06(b) below,
the Company hereby consents, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to
consent, to Acquirers and Acquirers officers, accountants, counsel,

Section 6.07 _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. 

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably

at the request of Acquirer: (i) take all action within its power reasonably
requested by Acquirer as necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute

of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Acquirer, and Acquirer and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
representation or warranty made by it becoming untrue or inaccurate in any

parties under this Agreement unless specifically agreed in writing to the
contrary. 

   

(c) For purposes of this Section 6.07, " _Governmental Entity_ " shall not

Section 6.08 _Company Employee Plans_. 

  

(a) Following the Effective Time, Acquirer shall cause the Surviving

to non-vested benefits. 

  

(b) Acquirer hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the employment agreements listed in Section

Section 6.09 _Indemnification; D andO Insurance, etc_. 

  

(a) Acquirer shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law but subject to all
applicable conduct requirements, cause the Surviving Corporation (from and
after the Effective Time) to honor all the Companys obligations to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including any obligations to advance
funds for expenses) the current and former directors and officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities arising out of or incurred in connection with, and amounts paid
in settlement of, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and wherever
asserted, bought or filed based upon alleged acts or omissions by any such
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time (including
without limitation any alleged act or omission in connection with the
Financing) to the maximum extent that such obligations of the Company exist on
the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the
Company By-Laws, the NHBCA, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and
such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company
By-Laws, the NHBCA and such individual indemnity agreements from the
Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions, provided that, in the event that any claim
for indemnification is asserted or made within the applicable statute of
limitations period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim
shall continue until the disposition of such claim. In the event a current or
former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.09(a), such
director or officer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Company
(prior to the Effective Time) or the Surviving Corporation (from and after
the Effective Time) for reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by
such director or officer in pursuing such indemnification, including payment
of such fees and expenses by the Surviving Corporation or the Company, as
applicable, in advance of the final disposition of such action upon receipt
of an undertaking by such current or former director or officer to repay such
payment if it shall be adjudicated that such current or former director or
officer was not entitled to such payment. The indemnity agreements of
Acquirer and the Surviving Corporation in this Section 6.09(a) shall extend,
on the same terms to, and shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by any present or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case, of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions and from
carriers with comparable credit ratings which are no less advantageous to the
insureds with respect to claims arising from facts or events, actions or
omissions on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 200% of the annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending
December 31, 2009 (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Corporation
is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.09(b) it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such
six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect
of each policy year within such period. The Company may in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or
carriers with comparable credit ratings, as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

(c) Subject to Section 6.09(d), the provisions that are set forth in Article
V, Sections 17 of the Surviving Corporations By-Laws, and Article XII of
the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who at or at any time prior to the Effective Time were
directors, officers, employees or other agents of the Company. 

  

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
and the continuing or surviving entity does not assume the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.09, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume, as a matter of Law or otherwise,
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.

statement, except that a party may, without providing the other party the
opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public
statements, issue such press release or make such public statement as the

agrees to indemnify the Company and each director of the Company for the
amount of its, his or her liability, if any, arising from the underlying
claim, net of any insurance proceeds actually received by such Person, that is
in excess of the amount for which such Person would have been liable under

    ##### 

  

   

Section 6.18 _Pennichuck Water Services Corporation Contracts_. 

  

The Company shall take all action necessary so that at the Effective Time
there shall be no default or state of facts which with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a material default on the part of Pennichuck
Water Services Corporation under any significant contract to which PWSC is a
party. If at the Effective Time (a) there shall be a material default or state
of facts which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
material default on the part of Pennichuck Water Services Corporation under
any significant contract and which would result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and (b) Acquirer determines that such default constitutes a violation
of the covenant made in this Section 6.18 and that Acquirer shall terminate
this Agreement, then this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section
8.02(d); provided, however, that in the event of such a termination, pursuant
to Section 8.03(b)(i) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such

Section 6.19 _Environmental Confirmation_. 

  

As soon as practicable following the Effective Date and prior to the Acquirer
Ratification Vote, the Company shall collect and analyze several samples from
the stockpile of soil, rock and asphalt located at 31 Will Street, Nashua,
New Hampshire to test solely for the presence of asbestos and PCBs. The
Company shall furnish to Acquirer copies of the results of such testing. If
such testing indicates that such stockpile complies with applicable EPA and
NHDES standards for the reuse of road spoils containing PCBs and asbestos
(the "Reuse Standards"), then no further action will be required by the
Company with respect to such stockpile, and the Company shall be deemed to
have satisfied the representation set forth in Section 3.18 with respect to
such stockpile as long as the Company continues to manage and maintain such
stockpile consistent with past practice. If such testing indicates levels of
PCBs and/or asbestos above the Reuse Standards, the Company shall remove such
stockpile and then collect and analyze several samples from the ground
beneath the removed stockpile to test solely for the presence of asbestos and
PCBs in the soil beneath such stockpile. The Company shall furnish to
Acquirer copies of the results of such ground sampling tests prior to the
Acquirer Ratification Vote. If such testing indicates that the soil beneath
the removed stockpile complies with applicable EPA and NHDES standards for
soil samples containing PCBs and asbestos ("Soil Standards"), then no further
action will be required by the Company with respect to such soil, and the
Company shall be deemed to have satisfied the representation set forth in
Section 3.18 with respect to the soil and any replacement stockpile as long
as the Company continues to manage and maintain such stockpile and soil
consistent with past practice. If the testing shows levels of PCBs and/or
asbestos above the Soil Standards, the Company shall prepare a comprehensive
plan for remediating the soil beneath the removed stockpile pursuant to
applicable Soil Standards (the "Remediation Plan") and present it to the
Acquirer prior to the Acquirer Ratification Vote. Prior to the date of the
Acquirer Ratification Vote, Acquirer shall notify the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Company whether Acquirer has determined that (a) the Remediation Plan
is satisfactory to Acquirer, or (b) the events indicated by such testing and
the Remediation Plan constitute a violation of the representation set forth
in Section 3.18 with the result that Acquirer shall terminate this Agreement.
If Acquirer notifies the Company that the Remediation Plan is satisfactory to
Acquirer, then the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied the
representation set forth in Section 3.18 with respect to the soil and any
replacement stockpile as long as the Company completes remediation in
accordance with the Remediation Plan prior to the Effective Time and continues
to manage and maintain such stockpile consistent with past practice. If
Acquirer determines that the events indicated by such testing and the
Remediation Plan constitute a violation of the representation set forth in
Section 3.18, then the Acquirer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(d); provided, however, that in the event
of such a termination, pursuant to Section 8.03(b)(i) all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring or required to incur such expenses, and the Company shall not be
required to pay Acquirer any penalty amounts, liquidated damages and/or
damages of any kind as the result of such termination.

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

the satisfaction or express written waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of
the following conditions:

Findings Vote.

obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all applicable
statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired or been
terminated (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting periods
being referred to herein as the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Requisite Regulatory Approvals" means,
to the extent deemed necessary by Acquirer: (i) a final nonappealable order
or orders of the NHPUC approving or authorizing or waiving jurisdiction with
respect to the Merger and granting any other necessary approvals with respect
to the Financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

deemed necessary by Acquirer to be necessary under applicable law. 

  

(d) _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No statute, rule, regulation, executive
Order, decree, temporary restraining Order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued
by any Governmental Entity or other legal restraint or prohibition (other
than the lack of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals) preventing
the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; provided, however, that
prior to asserting this condition each of the parties shall have used all
reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or other Order
and to appeal as promptly as possible any such injunction or other Order that

    ##### 

  

  

Section 7.02 _Conditions Precedent to Acquirer s and Acquisition
Subsidiarys Obligations_. 

  

Acquirer and Acquisition Subsidiary shall be obligated to effect the Merger
only if each of the following conditions is satisfied at or prior to the
Closing Date, unless any such condition is waived in writing by Acquirer: 

  

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties in Sections 3.03, 3.23, and the last sentence of 3.26) shall be
true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except
to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct as of such earlier date) as of the Closing Date with the same
force and effect as though made again at and as of the Closing Date,
provided, however, that for purposes of determining the satisfaction of
this condition, no effect shall be given to any qualification "To the
Knowledge of the Company" or any exception in such representations and
warranties relating to materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
instead, for purposes of this condition, such representations and
warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct in all respects unless the
failure or failures of such representations or warranties to be so true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, results or would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties
in Sections 3.03, 3.23, and the last sentence of 3.26 shall be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date with the same force and effect as though made again at and as of
the Closing Date (other than immaterial numerical inaccuracies in Section
3.03). Acquirer shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the
foregoing effect. 

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Company_. The Company shall have performed
in all material respects (without giving duplicative effect to any
materiality qualification contained in the applicable obligation) all
obligations required to be performed by it under Articles V and VI of this
Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time; and Acquirer shall have received
a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer to the foregoing effect. 

  

(c) _No Company Material Adverse Effect_. There shall not have occurred any
change in the business, assets, prospects, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that has had or
is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _No Burdensome Condition_. None of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
shall have imposed any term, condition, obligation or restriction upon
Acquirer, Acquisition Subsidiary, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that Acquirer reasonably determines would, individually or in
the aggregate (i) be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or
(ii) so fundamentally and materially adversely affect the economic benefits
to Acquirer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a
whole, as to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger (a "Burdensome
Condition"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term
"Burdensome Condition" shall include, but not be limited to, any order or
orders of the NHPUC approving the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that does not, or do not, approve an aggregate
acquisition premium to be reflected in the accounts of the Regulated Company
Subsidiaries and included in their respective rate bases to be recovered
through rates with a return in a manner that, together with other components
of the rates of the Regulated Company Subsidiaries, will be sufficient to
enable Acquirer to satisfy all of the operating and debt service costs of the
Regulated Company Subsidiaries and Acquirers obligations under the
Financing, as such operating and debt service costs and Financing
obligations are mutually agreed to by the parties and reflected in the
petition filed with the NHPUC for approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If the NHPUC issues a final and nonappealable
order or orders approving the Merger and providing any other
necessary approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and Acquirer determines that such order or orders include a term or
provision that is a Burdensome Condition, Acquirer shall provide written
notice of such determination to the Company within 90 days after the date
on which such order or orders shall have become final and nonappealable (a
"Burdensome Condition Notice"). Acquirer shall be deemed to have waived this
Section 7.02(d) if Acquirer shall have failed to provide a Burdensome
Condition Notice within 90 days after the date on which such order or orders
shall have become final and nonappealable. 

  

(e) _Financing_. Acquirer shall have made financing arrangements to provide
the funds required to satisfy the cash payment obligations of Acquirer under
this Agreement on terms that Acquirer reasonably determines are acceptable to
Acquirer; provided, however, that Acquirer shall be deemed to have waived
this Section 7.02(e) if, at the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date
on which all of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII except this
Section 7.02(e) shall have been satisfied, Acquirer reasonably could have
obtained debt financing having the following terms and conditions: (i)
general obligations of the City; (ii) a total principal amount
of $160,000,000; (iii) repayment of principal over a term of 30 years with a
level payment structure; (iv) subject to optional redemption at par by the
City at any time ten years after issuance; (v) a true interest cost of no
greater than 6.50%; and (vi) interest on the obligations includable in gross
income for federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Acquirer shall be deemed to have waived this Section 7.02(e) if Acquirer
shall have failed to use its commercial best efforts to obtain such financing
arrangements within 90 days after the date on which all of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VII except this Section 7.02(e) shall have
been satisfied. 

  

(f) _Dissenters._ The holders of no greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the
Company Common Stock shall have exercised statutory rights under the
Dissenters Rights Provisions and shall not have waived or abandoned those
rights as of the Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 7.03 _Conditions to Obligation of Company_. 

  

Company shall be obligated to effect the Merger only if each of the following
conditions is satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date, unless any such
condition is waived in writing by Company: 

  

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Acquirer and Acquisition Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement shall be true
and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date,
in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct
as of such earlier date) as of the Closing Date with the same force and
effect as though made again at and as of the Closing Date, provided, however,
that for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this condition, no
effect shall be given to any qualification "To the Knowledge of the Acquirer"
or any exception in such representations and warranties relating to
materiality, a material adverse impact on Acquirer, and instead, for purposes
of this condition, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be
true and correct in all respects unless the failure or failures of such
representations or warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, have or would have a material adverse impact on Acquirer. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Acquirer by
a duly authorized official of the Acquirer to such effect. 

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Acquirer and Acquisition Subsidiary_.
Acquirer and Acquisition Subsidiary shall each have performed in all material
respects (without giving duplicative effect to any materiality qualification
contained in the applicable obligation) all obligations required to be
performed by them under Article VI of this Agreement at or prior to
the Closing Date; and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Acquirer by a duly authorized official of the Acquirer to the
foregoing effect. 

  

(c) _Joinder by Acquisition Subsidiary_. Acquisition Subsidiary shall have
approved and executed this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VIII. 

   

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  

   

Section 8.01 _Ratification Required_.

Acquisition Subsidiary, until such time as the Acquirer Governing Body shall
have obtained the Acquirer Ratification Vote and the Acquirer Special
Findings Vote. 

   

Section 8.02 _Termination_. 

  

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of Company Stockholder
Approval:

the request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant
such Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the forty-five- (45-) day
period following such denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an
amended application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity;
provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.02(b)(i) if such denial or request
or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein, or (ii) if any Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final, nonappealable Order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

(c) by the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein) if the Acquirer has failed to obtain the Financing necessary for
Closing the Merger as specified in this Agreement within 90 days after the

except Section 7.02(e) are satisfied or waived; 

  

(d) by either Acquirer or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,

material breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations or other agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within 30 days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to Closing; 

  

(e) by either Acquirer or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred prior to December 31, 2011, unless the failure of the Effective Time
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein; 

  

(f) by either Acquirer or the Company if the Acquirer Governing Body shall not
have obtained the Acquirer Ratification Vote and the Acquirer Special

Approval, in order to enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement

"), if the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 5.02(h);
provided, that any such purported termination by the Company pursuant to

Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.03(c); and 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(i) by either Acquirer or the Company if the Acquirer shall have provided the

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination; Expenses and Liquidated Damages_. 

  

(a) _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by the Company or Acquirer as provided in Section 8.02, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i)
Sections 6.06, 6.09, 8.03 and Article IX shall survive any termination
of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of fraud or a knowing and intentional
breach of any provision of this Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party
shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
For the avoidance of doubt, Acquirer and the Company hereby acknowledge and
agree that in the event of a breach of this Agreement arising out of fraud,
or a knowing and intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement, the
aggrieved party may either (i) seek all rights and remedies that may
be available at law or in equity, or (ii) terminate this Agreement and claim
liquidated damages in accordance with Section 8.03(b), but may not pursue
both legal action and claim liquidated damages. 

   

(b) _Expenses and Liquidated Damages_. 

   

(i) Except as set forth in this Section 8.03(b), whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such expenses. 

   

(ii) Subject to Section 6.18 and Section 6.19, if Acquirer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(d), then the Company shall pay Acquirer
$1,500,000 as liquidated damages related to entering into this Agreement and
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(d),
then Acquirer shall pay the Company $1,500,000 as liquidated damages related
to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

(iv) If Acquirer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(g), then
the Company shall be liable to Acquirer for $250,000 as liquidated damages
related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

    

    ##### 

  

 

(v) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.03(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that any
payment by one party to the other pursuant to any of the provisions of this
Section 8.03(b) is not a penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Acquirer or the Company, as the case
may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance of this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. For the avoidance of
doubt, the payment by one party to the other pursuant to any of the
provisions of this Section 8.03(b) shall be the exclusive remedy available
for termination of this Agreement pursuant to the subsections indicated in
this Section 8.03(b). 

  

(c) _Acquirer Termination Fee_. To induce Acquirer to enter into this
Agreement and to reimburse Acquirer for incurring the costs and expenses
related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, pursuant to the provisions of this Section
8.03(c) the Company will make a cash payment to Acquirer (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquirer) of FIVE
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,500,000) (the " _Acquirer
Termination Fee_ "), less any amount(s) paid by Company to Acquirer
under Section 8.03(b), it being understood by the parties that in no event
shall Acquirer be entitled to receive under Sections 8.03(a), 8.03(b) and
8.03(c) an amount exceeding the Acquirer Termination Fee, in the event of one
or more of the following occurrences: 

   

(i) the Company has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(h);
or 

   

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, any bona fide Company Alternative
Proposal, with each reference to "20%" in the definition thereof replaced
with "50%", (hereinafter a " _Superior Company Alternative Proposal_ ") shall
have been publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by Acquirer or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.02(g), and (B) concurrently with or
within twelve (12) months after such termination, any definitive agreement
providing for a Superior Company Alternative Proposal shall have been entered
into by the Company or a transaction contemplated by any Superior Company
Alternative Proposal shall have been consummated; or 

   

(iii) Acquirer has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(d)
because a Company Change in Recommendation shall have occurred, and, at the
time of the Company Change of Recommendation, a Superior Company Alternative
Proposal had been made and not withdrawn; or 

   

(iv) (A) Acquirer has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(d),
and (B) the breach of the representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or
agreement was caused by the willful conduct or gross negligence of the
Company and, at the time of such breach, a bona fide Superior Company
Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not withdrawn,
and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such
termination, any definitive agreement providing for a Superior Company
Alternative Proposal shall have been entered into by the Company with any
Person other than Acquirer or an Affiliate of Acquirer or a transaction
contemplated by any Superior Company Alternative Proposal shall have been
consummated. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

The Acquirer Termination Fee payable in accordance with this Section 8.03(c)
shall constitute liquidated damages and shall be the sole remedy of Acquirer
for termination of this Agreement under the circumstances described in this
Section 8.03(c). The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.03(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
further acknowledges that the payment of the Acquirer Termination Fee is not
a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Acquirer, in the circumstances in which such Acquirer
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance of
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. 

   

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. 

  

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties. This Agreement may be so amended by the
parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, or before or after receipt of the approvals of the Acquirer
Governing Body referred to in Section 7.01(b); provided, however, that after
receipt of such Company Stockholder Approval, or such approvals of the
Acquirer Governing Body, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or the Acquirer
Governing Body, respectively; and provided, further, that after this Agreement
is approved by the Companys stockholders, no such amendment or modification
shall be made that reduces the amount or changes the form of Merger
Consideration or otherwise materially and adversely affects the rights of the
Companys stockholders hereunder, without the further approval of
such stockholders. 

   

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. 

  

At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, or (c) subject to the proviso in the second sentence of
this Section 8.05, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

   

Section 8.06 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. 

  

A termination of this Agreement, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.04 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.05 shall, in
order to be effective, require, in the case of Acquirer, action by the
Acquirer Governing Body, or, in the case of Acquisition Subsidiary or the
Company, action by its board of directors.

warranties contained in this Agreement or to imply that such matters are or
are not material and neither party shall use, in any dispute between the
parties, the fact of any such disclosure as evidence of what is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

  

Section 2\. Suits, etc.. by or in the Right of the Corporation. The
Corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or
misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only
to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for expenses which the court shall deem proper. 

  

Section 3\. Scope of Indemnification. To the extent that a Director, officer,
employee or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section
1 or 2 above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter based on Section 1
or 2 above, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys,
fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4\. Determination of Indemnification. Any indemnification under
Section 1 or 2 above, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the
corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Section 1 or 2 above. This determination shall be made: 

  

      | (1)  |   | By the Board of Directors by a majority of vote of
a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit or
proceeding;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | By independent legal counsel in a written opinion if
such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of
disinterested Directors so directs; or  
      
    | (3)  |   | By the Sole Shareholder.  
   

  

Section 5\. Payment of Expenses. Expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred
in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or
proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in Section 4 above, upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee
or agent to repay the amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he
is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this
section. 

  

Section 6\. Other Rights. The indemnification provided by this section shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be
entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of the Sole Shareholder or
disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office, and
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of that person. 

  

Section 7\. Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him against this liability under
the provisions of this section.

EXHIBIT C TO MERGER AGREEMENT 

   

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  

  

This Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of November 11, 2010 (the
"Effective Date") is made and entered into by and between the City of Nashua,
New Hampshire ("City") and Pennichuck Corporation ("PNNW"), Pennichuck Water
Works, Inc. ("PWW"), Pennichuck East Utility, Inc. ("PEU"), Pittsfield
Aqueduct Company, Inc. ("PAC") and Pennichuck Water Service Corporation
("PWSC"). (PNNW, PWW, PEU, PAC and PWSC are collectively referred to
as "Pennichuck".) 

  

WHEREAS, the City and Pennichuck are parties to an eminent domain proceeding
pursuant to RSA Chapter 38 before the New Hampshire Public Utilities
Commission ("PUC"), docketed by the PUC as DW 04-048 (the "PUC Eminent Domain
Proceeding"); 

  

WHEREAS, on July 25, 2008, the PUC issued its Order No. 24,878 (the "PUC
Approval Order") concluding, among other things, that (i) the taking of the
plant and property of PWW by eminent domain is in the public interest, (ii)
the initial valuation of such plant and property as of December 31, 2008 was
$203 million, and (iii) the City must establish a $40 million mitigation
fund to protect the interests of the customers of PEU and PAC; 

  

WHEREAS, on March 25, 2010, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the PUC
Approval Order No. 24,878 and the PUCs Order No. 24,948, which decision
became effective upon issuance of the Courts mandate on April 7, 2010; 

  

WHEREAS, it is the Citys and Pennichucks desire, and it is mutually
beneficial to them and, they believe, in the public interest to resolve their
differences on a consensual basis, rather than through continuation of the
administrative litigation process (including potential appeals) that would
otherwise be necessary to conclude the eminent domain process under NH RSA
38; 

  

WHEREAS, the City and Pennichuck have executed and delivered that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 11, 2010 (the "Merger
Agreement") which provides for the City directly or indirectly to acquire all
of the issued and outstanding shares of PNNW stock and common stock
equivalents (the "Merger") as a means of acquiring control over the water
systems owned and operated by Pennichuck; 

  

WHEREAS, the City and Pennichuck have entered into the Merger Agreement,
together with this Agreement, to effect a comprehensive settlement of the
eminent domain dispute between the parties relating to the acquisition by the
City of the water system owned and operated by PWW, pursuant to the
provisions of NH RSA Chapter 38 and Chapter 347, Section 5 of 2007 N.H. Laws,
as amended by Chapter 1, Section 118 of the Laws of the 2010 Special Session
(the "Special Legislative Authority"); 

  

WHEREAS, as a condition and material inducement to Pennichucks entry into the
Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, the City has entered into
this Agreement with Pennichuck; and 

 

    ##### 

  

  

WHEREAS, it is the Citys and Pennichucks intention that this Agreement shall
be binding and enforceable on each of them. 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
conditions set forth below, the City and Pennichuck agree as follows: 

  

    1.  |   | _Settlement and Resolution of the PUC Eminent Domain
Proceeding_. In consideration of the agreements set forth herein and in the
Merger Agreement, the City and Pennichuck agree to settle all claims,
controversies and disputes between the parties in the PUC Eminent
Domain Proceeding, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.  |   | _Final Determination of Price; Ratification Vote_. The City
and Pennichuck agree that they intend that $29.00 per share for the common
stock and/or common stock equivalents of PNNW (the "Price"), as stated in the
Merger Agreement, shall constitute the "final determination of the price to
be paid for the plant and property to be acquired under the provisions of
RSA 38:8, 38:9 or 38:10 and any consequential damages under RSA 38:33" within
the meaning of NH RSA 38:13. Accordingly, the City agrees that it shall,
within 90 days after the date of the Merger Agreement, take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Citys Board of Aldermen for the purpose of taking action by an
affirmative vote of not less than 10 members of the Citys Board of Aldermen
(a) to approve and ratify, pursuant to NH RSA 38:13 and the Special
Legislative Authority, the issuance of bonds and notes necessary to defray
the costs to be incurred by the City to consummate the Merger pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (if so approved and ratified,
the "Acquirer Ratification Vote"), and (b) to make the findings required by
the Special Legislative Authority (if so made, the "Acquirer Special Findings
Vote"). The City agrees that (i) an affirmative vote of less than 10 members
of the Citys Board of Aldermen regarding the Acquirer Ratification Vote, or
(ii) the failure by the Board of Alderman to take a vote within the 90-day
period specified in this Paragraph 2, shall each constitute a vote in
the negative for purposes of RSA 38:13.  
      
  3.  |   | _Withdrawal Notice; Escrow Agreement_. The City and Pennichuck
agree that the petition filed by the City in DW 04-048 should be dismissed
with prejudice, subject to the terms and conditions of this Settlement
Agreement, except to the extent necessary for the PUC to approve the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Contemporaneous with the execution of this Agreement, the City and Pennichuck
have each executed the Joint Notice of Withdrawal and Motion for Dismissal
with Prejudice attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Withdrawal Notice"). The
City and Pennichuck agree to cause the executed Withdrawal Notice to be
delivered to a person who shall hold the Withdrawal Notice as escrow agent
pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement").  
    

 

    ##### 

  

  

    4.  |   | _Filing of the Withdrawal Notice with the PUC_. Upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement by either the City or Pennichuck in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.02 thereof, the City and Pennichuck
agree that, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Pennichuck
shall have the right, upon providing five (5) days prior written notice to
the escrow agent (the "Notice"), with a contemporaneous copy to the
City (addressed to City Corporation Counsel), to direct the Escrow Agent to
release the Withdrawal Notice to Pennichucks independent attorneys, McLane,
Graf, Raulerson and Middleton ("Pennichucks Attorney"). Such Notice to the
Escrow Agent shall include evidence that Pennichuck has provided the required
Notice copy to the City. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Escrow
Agent shall release the Withdrawal Notice to Pennichucks Attorney no sooner
than five days after the Escrow Agents receipt of such Notice. Promptly
after the Escrow Agents disbursement of the Withdrawal Notice to
Pennichucks Attorney, Pennichuck shall cause Pennichucks Attorney to file
the Withdrawal Notice with the PUC.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.  |   | _Effect of Filing of the Withdrawal Notice_. The City and
Pennichuck each agree that, upon the filing of the Withdrawal Notice and the
dismissal of the PUC Eminent Domain Proceeding, they each release and forever
discharge the other party and their officers, members, shareholders,
directors, attorneys, agents, representatives, employees, and subsidiaries of
and from any and all actions, claims, debts, controversies,
promises, compensation, and liabilities of whatsoever kind and nature,
including any claim for monetary damages or lost profits that they may have
and/or could have had against one another, arising out of or in connection
with the PUC Eminent Domain Proceeding; provided however, that each of the
parties shall be fully subject to the terms and conditions and provisions of
the Merger Agreement, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including but
not limited to the obligation to pay any liquidated damages or the Company
Termination Fee, as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement; and
provided further that the parties acknowledge this Agreement, including the
foregoing release, shall not affect, restrict, diminish or extinguish any
rights that Pennichuck Water Works has or may have to recover its defense-
related expenses associated with the PUC Eminent Domain Proceeding through
PUC approved rates it charges its customers (including the City).  
      
  6.  |   | _Representations and Warranties of the Parties_. Each of the
parties hereto represents and warrants to the other party as follows:  
   

  

      | (a)  |   | _Authority and Enforceability_. Each party has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by each party has been duly authorized by all authorities
required to approve such actions. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each party and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of each party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights and by the effect of the principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

    ##### 

  

  

      | (b)  |   | _No Conflicts or Consents_. The execution and
delivery and performance of this Agreement does not conflict with (i) any
statute, rule, regulation or law to which any party is subject, or (ii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease or other
instrument or obligation to which any party is a party or is otherwise
subject. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each party does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by each party will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permission of any governmental entity or
person, except to the extent that the requests made through the filing of the
Withdrawal Notice will be subject to the review and approval of the PUC.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

    7.  |   | _Equitable Remedies_. Because an award of money damages
would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by a party, and any such
breach would cause any other party irreparable harm, the parties also agree
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, any
such aggrieved non-breaching party will also be entitled, without
the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not
be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.  |   | _Other Provisions_.  
   

  

      | (a)  |   | _Modification_. This Agreement may be modified or
waived only by a separate writing signed by each party.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
because of any law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  
      
    | (c)  |   | _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed under the laws of the State of New Hampshire without regard to
conflicts-of-laws principles.  
      
    | (d)  |   | _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement
may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. Any signature on this Agreement or any related instrument or
agreement that is delivered by facsimile or by electronic data file shall
have the same effect as an original.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have entered into this Agreement as of the
date first set forth above.

understood and agreed that Escrow Agent shall:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

      | (a)  |   | be under no duty to accept information from any
person other than the City and Pennichuck and then only to the extent and in
the manner provided in this Escrow Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | be protected in acting upon any written notice,
opinion, request, certificate, approval, consent or other document believed
by it to be genuine and signed by the proper party or parties;  
      
    | (c)  |   | be deemed conclusively to have given and delivered any
notice required to be given or delivered hereunder if the same is given in
accordance with Section 11 hereof;  
      
    | (d)  |   | be indemnified and held harmless jointly and severally
by the City and Pennichuck against any claim made against it by reason of its
acting or failing to act in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and against any loss, liability or expense, including the
expense of defending itself against any claim of liability it may sustain in
carrying out the terms of this Escrow Agreement, except such claims as are
occasioned by its bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or
any breach of fiduciary duty; _provided_ , _however_ , that promptly after
the receipt by Escrow Agent of notice of any demand or claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, Escrow Agent shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against any of the other parties
hereto, notify each other party thereof in writing; and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the indemnitors hereunder shall be entitled, jointly
or severally and at their own expense, to participate in and/or assume the

duties under this Escrow Agreement being understood to be purely ministerial
in nature;

    | (f)  |   | be permitted to consult with counsel of its choice and
shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good
faith in accordance with the written advice of such counsel; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this subsection (f), nor any action
taken by Escrow Agent, or of any counsel, shall relieve Escrow Agent from
liability for any claims which are occasioned by its bad faith, gross
negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or any breach of fiduciary duty, all as
provided in subsection (d) above;  
      
    | (g)  |   | not be bound by any modification, amendment,
termination, cancellation, rescission or supersession of this Escrow
Agreement, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the
parties hereto;  
      
    | (h)  |   | if and to the extent it is uncertain as to its duties
and rights hereunder, be entitled to refrain from taking any action other
than to keep all property held by it in escrow until it shall be directed
otherwise in a joint writing by the City and Pennichuck, in accordance with
this Escrow Agreement, or by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction;  
      
    | (i)  |   | have no liability for any act or omission done pursuant
to the instructions contained or expressly provided for herein, or written
instructions given by joint instructions of the City and Pennichuck pursuant
hereto;  
      
    | (j)  |   | have the right, at any time, to resign hereunder by
giving written notice of its resignation to the City and Pennichuck, at their
addresses set forth below, at least 30 Business Days prior to the date
specified for such resignation to take effect; in which case, upon the
effective date of such resignation:  
   

  

      | (i)  |   | the Withdrawal Notice shall be delivered by it to
such person as may be designated jointly in writing by the City and
Pennichuck, whereupon Escrow Agents performance obligations hereunder shall
cease and terminate; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if no such person has been designated by such date,
Escrow Agents sole responsibility thereafter shall be to keep all property
then held by it and to deliver the same to a person designated jointly in
writing by the City and Pennichuck, or, if no such person shall have been so
designated, in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction, and the provisions of subsections (f) and
(j) of this Section 7 shall remain in effect.   
  

 

    ##### 

  

 

   

  

    8.  |   | _Entire Agreement_. This Escrow Agreement shall constitute
the entire agreement of the Escrow Agent and the Depositors with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes any other prior oral or written
agreements, arrangements or understandings between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.  |   | _Waiver_. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Escrow Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such breach or a waiver of any subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay
in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power
or remedy by such party preclude any other further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.  
      
  10.  |   | _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Escrow Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon Pennichuck, the City and
Escrow Agent and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Escrow Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any person not a party to this Escrow Agreement. Except
as specifically set forth herein, no assignment of this Escrow Agreement or
of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party hereto (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of all other
parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents
shall be void.  
      
  11.  |   | _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder will be given in writing and either electronically
by email or by facsimile. Any notice, request, demand, claim, or other
communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given in writing two Business
Days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to the intended recipient as set

EXHIBIT D TO MERGER AGREEMENT 

   

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT  

  

Agreement made this 11th day of November, 2010 (the "Effective Date") by
and between the City of Nashua, New Hampshire, a New Hampshire municipal
corporation with an address of 229 Main Street, Nashua, New Hampshire
("Nashua") and Pennichuck Corporation, a New Hampshire business corporation
with its principal office at 25 Manchester Street, Merrimack, New
Hampshire ("Pennichuck")(collectively, Nashua and Pennichuck are sometimes
referred to herein as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party"). 

  

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties have executed that
certain Merger Agreement of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"). The
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Transactions") could
become the basis to resolve and settle an administrative proceeding (No.
DW-04-048) before the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission ("NHPUC")
involving the Parties as well as certain Pennichuck subsidiaries (the "Eminent
Domain Case"). In connection with discussions to resolve and settle the
Eminent Domain Case and to negotiate and perform obligations under the Merger
Agreement, each Party has received and may receive certain Confidential
Information (as defined below) of the other Party. (For purposes of this
Agreement, the Party that discloses Confidential Information is sometimes
referred to as the "Discloser," and the Party that receives Confidential
Information is sometimes referred to as the "Recipient.") 

  

In consideration of the Merger Agreement and as a condition to each Party
furnishing access to such Confidential Information, the Parties agree to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement: 

  

    1.  |   | _Confidential and Proprietary Nature of the Information_.
Each Party acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the
Confidential Information (as defined below), agrees to hold and keep the
Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement and otherwise agrees
to each and every restriction and obligation of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.  |   | _Confidential Information_. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Confidential Information" means any information, whether oral or
documented in written, electronic or other format, concerning the operations,
strategies, plans and affairs of Discloser and any of its subsidiaries (which
shall include, without limitation, Disclosers organizational information and
plans, legal arrangements and plans, income and other tax plans and
strategies, personnel information, severance arrangements, capital
expenditure programs and plans, business plans and budgets, historical and
projected financial information, contracts and contractor arrangements),
which has been or may hereafter be provided or otherwise disclosed by
Discloser or by the directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants,
advisors, or other representatives, including legal counsel, accountants and
financial advisors ("Representatives") of Discloser to Recipient or to any of
Recipients Representatives. Confidential Information   
   

 

    ##### 

  

  

      |   | includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies,
summaries, and other material prepared by Recipient and/or its
Representatives containing any Confidential Information or prepared using any
Confidential Information. Discloser or its Representatives shall identify to
Recipient in writing which information it considers to be confidential,
either by marking documents as "Confidential" or by promptly confirming in
writing any oral or other information that it considers to be
confidential. If Recipient or its Representatives are unsure whether certain
information provided to it should be considered Confidential Information, it
shall treat that information as Confidential Information until it receives a
response to a specific inquiry via notice made to the Discloser, which
response Discloser shall provide by return notice within 10 business days
following its receipt of notice pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement.
Confidential Information does not include information that Recipient or its
Representatives already know from disclosures not then subject to a duty of
confidentiality or information that becomes publicly available through no
fault of Recipient and/or its Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt,
the term "Confidential Information" does not include Proposals,
Prior Disclosures and Prior Privileged Information as those terms are defined
in Section 9 of this Agreement; provided, however, to the extent, and only to
the extent, that any of such Proposals, Prior Disclosures and Prior
Privileged Information include any Confidential Information as defined in
this Section 2, the Recipient and its Representatives shall treat such
portion of any Proposal, Prior Disclosure or Prior Privileged Information
as Confidential Information in accordance with all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  3.  |   | _Restricted Use of Confidential Information_.  
      
  (a)  |   | Each Party agrees that the Confidential Information (i) will
be kept confidential by Recipient and its Representatives and (ii) without
limiting the foregoing, will not be disclosed by Recipient or its
Representatives to any person and/or third party, other than the Discloser
and its Representatives, except with the prior written consent of the
Discloser, (as applicable, James McNamee in the case of Nashua and Roland
Olivier in the case of Pennichuck), or except as otherwise expressly
permitted by this Agreement.  
      
  (b)  |   | It is understood that Recipient may only disclose
Confidential Information to those of its Representatives who (i) require such
material for the purpose of evaluating the possible Transactions and (ii) are
informed by Recipient of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information and the obligations of this Agreement. Each Party
further agrees that Recipient and its Representatives will not use any of the
Confidential Information for any reason or purpose other than for the purpose
of consummating the Transactions and the Merger Agreement. Each Party also
agrees to enforce the terms of this Agreement as to such
Partys Representatives and to take such action, legal or otherwise, to the
extent necessary to cause them to comply with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.  
      
  (c)  |   | The Parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the
Effective Date of this Agreement, any information constituting Proposals,
Prior Disclosures or Prior Privileged Information shall not be subject to the
nondisclosure requirements of this Section 3, except to the extent, and only
to the extent, that such Proposals, Prior Disclosures or Prior Information
include Confidential Information that is subject to nondisclosure under
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  
    

 

    ##### 

  

  

    4.  |   | _Use of Confidential Information, Proposals, Prior
Disclosures or Prior Privileged Information in Any Proceeding Between the
Parties_. The Parties hereby agree that all communications between the
Parties and/or their respective Representatives which disclose any of the
Confidential Information, Proposals, Prior Disclosures or Prior Privileged
Information shall not be admissible or discoverable for any purpose in any
adjudicative proceeding, including impeachment, including, without
limitation, the Eminent Domain Case or any other litigation or proceeding of
any kind in any forum involving the Parties, and shall be protected from
disclosure to anyone as settlement discussions for purposes of all
applicable rules of evidence, including specifically Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence and Rule 408 of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence, which
the Parties agree, for purposes of enforcing this Agreement, shall be deemed
to apply to proceedings before the NHPUC and to any other litigation, appeal
or proceeding of any kind in any forum involving any of the Parties to
this Agreement. The Parties agree that a copy of this Agreement may be
introduced into evidence in any administrative or court proceeding in which
any person seeks the disclosure of information which is the subject of this
Agreement for the sole purpose of protecting the confidentiality and
privilege of such information, provided that the Agreement is placed under
seal. For avoidance of doubt, and except as otherwise expressly permitted
under this Agreement, the Parties agree that Confidential Information,
Proposals, Prior Disclosures and Prior Privileged Information, shall not be
disclosed as part of any answer to a data request or other request for
production in the Eminent Domain Case.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.  |   | _Exceptions_. All of the foregoing obligations and
restrictions do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information that
Recipient demonstrates (a) was or becomes generally available to the public
prior to, and other than as a result of, a disclosure by Recipient or its
Representatives, or (b) was available, or becomes available, to Recipient on
a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure to Recipient by Discloser or
Disclosers Representative, but only if the source of such information is not
bound by a confidentiality obligation with respect to that part of the
Confidential Information.  
      
  6.  |   | _Legal Proceedings_. If either Party or any of its
Representatives becomes legally compelled (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or
criminal investigative demand or similar process, including but not
limited to a proceeding to require disclosure of information pursuant to
NHRSA Chapter 91-A) (such questions, interrogatories, requests, documents,
subpoena, demand or similar process and/or proceeding referred to
collectively herein as "Legal Proceedings") to make any disclosure
of Confidential Information that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by
this Agreement, such Party or such Representative, as the case may be, will
provide the other Party with prompt written notice of such Legal Proceedings
so that either or both Parties (with cooperation of the other Party or both
Parties respectively) may seek an appropriate protective order and/or other
appropriate relief or so that the other Party, in its sole discretion, may
waive compliance  
   

 

    ##### 

  

  

      |   | with the provisions of this Agreement. In the absence of
such relief or receiving such a waiver from the other Party, Recipient (
_i.e._ , the Party being compelled to legally disclose) or its Representative
is permitted (with Disclosers cooperation but at the Recipients expense)
to disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential
Information that Recipient or its Representative is legally compelled to
disclose. Subject to the foregoing, Recipient or such Representative may
furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information
that, in the written opinion of its counsel, Recipient is legally compelled
or is otherwise required to disclose or else stand liable for contempt or
suffer other censure or penalty; provided, however, that Recipient and the
Recipients Representatives must use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential
Information so disclosed.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties further intend that any
Confidential Information be treated as exempt from disclosure pursuant to NH
RSA 91-A and specifically that the Parties further intend that any
Confidential Information, be treated as "confidential, commercial
or financial information" of the Parties, as set forth in NH RSA 91-A:5, IV.
Consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of NH RSA
Chapter 91-A, Nashua shall take action to protect such Confidential
Information from disclosure.  
      
  7.  |   | _Destruction or Return of Confidential Information_. Upon the
written request of the Discloser, Recipient agrees that it will destroy or
return (at Disclosers sole option) all documents or other matters
constituting the Disclosers Confidential Information in the possession or
control of Recipient or Recipients Representatives. Upon the termination
of the Merger Agreement for any reason, both Parties agree that they will
destroy or return (at the Disclosers sole option) all documents or other
matters constituting Confidential Information. Any such destruction or return
pursuant to the foregoing shall be certified in writing by an authorized
officer supervising such destruction.  
      
  8.  |   | _Remedies_. Because an award of money damages would be
inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by either Party and/or its
Representatives, and any such breach would cause the non-breaching Party
irreparable harm, each Party also agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will also be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such
remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement
but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to
the non-breaching Party.  
      
  9.  |   | _Entire Agreement and Termination of Prior Agreements_. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the
matters covered by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
matters covered by this Agreement, and all amendments thereto, including, but
not limited to, the Confidentiality Agreement between Nashua and Pennichuck
dated January 14, 2009 (the "2009 Confidentiality Agreement"), the
Confidentiality Agreement between Nashua and Pennichuck dated August 8, 2006,
supplemented by a First Supplement to such Confidentiality Agreement dated
August 28, 2006 (the "2006 Confidentiality Agreement"), and as further

      |   | modified by a Agreement between Steven Camerino and Alan
Reische dated October 5, 2006 (collectively, the "Prior Agreements").
Accordingly, the Parties hereby agree to terminate the Prior Agreements as of
the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the termination of the Prior Agreements,
with respect to all Proposals (as that term is defined in the
2009 Confidentiality Agreement, which shall be referred to in this Agreement
as "Proposals"), Discussions and Communications (as those terms are defined
in the Prior Agreements, and collectively such Discussions and Communications
shall be referred to in this Agreement as "Prior Disclosures") and with
respect to all information or activities that were deemed privileged pursuant
to Section 4 of the 2006 Confidentiality Agreement (collectively
such information and activities are referred to in this Agreement as "Prior
Privileged Information"), the Parties specifically acknowledge that said
Prior Disclosures and Prior Privileged Information shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the express
references to Prior Disclosures and Prior Privileged Information set forth in
this Agreement. Furthermore, in terminating the Prior Agreements, the
Parties agree that those persons who obtained access to Confidential
Information pursuant to the Prior Agreements, including those persons listed
on Exhibit A to the 2006 Confidentiality Agreement, remain subject to the
confidentiality, nondisclosure and privilege obligations with respect only to
Confidential Information as expressly specified in this Agreement
as Representatives of their respective Party.
