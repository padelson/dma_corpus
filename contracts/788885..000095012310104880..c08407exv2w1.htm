transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Acquirer that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01. If any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be unable to surrender such holder&#146;s Certificates because such Certificates have
been lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and
indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

confidentiality agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related
agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such
party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this
Agreement and shall contain a standstill provision substantially similar to the standstill
provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such provisions remain in effect (it being
agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any particular standstill provision to

any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal or
administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by
reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses,
including attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any

judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee or

his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or
suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but
in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity

Date&#148;) is made and entered into by and between the City of Nashua, New Hampshire (&#147;City&#148;) and
Pennichuck Corporation (&#147;PNNW&#148;), Pennichuck Water Works, Inc. (&#147;PWW&#148;), Pennichuck East Utility,
Inc. (&#147;PEU&#148;), Pittsfield Aqueduct Company, Inc. (&#147;PAC&#148;) and Pennichuck Water Service
Corporation (&#147;PWSC&#148;). (PNNW, PWW, PEU, PAC and PWSC are collectively referred to as
&#147;Pennichuck&#148;.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS<B>, </B>the City and Pennichuck are parties to an eminent domain proceeding pursuant to RSA
Chapter&nbsp;38 before the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (&#147;PUC&#148;), docketed by the PUC as DW
04-048 (the &#147;PUC Eminent Domain Proceeding&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, on July&nbsp;25, 2008, the PUC issued its Order No.&nbsp;24,878 (the &#147;PUC Approval Order&#148;)
concluding, among other things, that (i)&nbsp;the taking of the plant and property of PWW by eminent
domain is in the public interest, (ii)&nbsp;the initial valuation of such plant and property as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $203&nbsp;million, and (iii)&nbsp;the City must establish a $40&nbsp;million mitigation fund
to protect the interests of the customers of PEU and PAC;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS<B>, </B>on March&nbsp;25, 2010, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the PUC Approval Order
No.&nbsp;24,878 and the PUC&#146;s Order No.&nbsp;24,948, which decision became effective upon issuance of the
Court&#146;s mandate on April&nbsp;7, 2010;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, it is the City&#146;s and Pennichuck&#146;s desire, and it is mutually beneficial to them and,
they believe, in the public interest to resolve their differences on a consensual basis, rather
than through continuation of the administrative litigation process (including potential appeals)
that would otherwise be necessary to conclude the eminent domain process under NH RSA 38;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the City and Pennichuck have executed and delivered that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of November&nbsp;11, 2010 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) which provides for the City
directly or indirectly to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of PNNW stock and common
stock equivalents (the &#147;Merger&#148;) as a means of acquiring control over the water systems owned and
operated by Pennichuck;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the City and Pennichuck have entered into the Merger Agreement, together with this
Agreement, to effect a comprehensive settlement of the eminent domain dispute between the parties
relating to the acquisition by the City of the water system owned and operated by PWW, pursuant to
the provisions of NH RSA Chapter&nbsp;38 and Chapter&nbsp;347, Section&nbsp;5 of 2007 N.H. Laws, as amended by
Chapter&nbsp;1, Section&nbsp;118 of the Laws of the 2010 Special Session (the &#147;Special Legislative

408 of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence, which the Parties agree, for purposes of enforcing
this Agreement, shall be deemed to apply to proceedings before the NHPUC and to any other
litigation, appeal or proceeding of any kind in any forum involving any of the Parties to this
Agreement. The Parties agree that a copy of this Agreement may be introduced into evidence in
any administrative or court proceeding in which any person seeks the disclosure of information
which is the subject of this Agreement for the sole purpose of protecting the confidentiality
