(a) each Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or
any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and outstanding
Share owned by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be
canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and no payment or
consideration shall be made with respect thereto;

 



 

(b) each issued and outstanding Share other than (i) Shares referred to in
_Section 3.1(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the
right to receive $10.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares or Book-Entry Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest; and

 



 

(c) each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

3.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
to act as disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") for the payment of
Merger Consideration upon (i) surrender of certificates representing the
Shares or (ii) transfer of book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Parent will
enter into a disbursing agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and, at or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to make the
payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ to holders of Shares (such amounts
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For purposes of
determining the amount to be so deposited, Merger Subsidiary shall assume that
no stockholder of the Company will perfect any right to appraisal of his, her
or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be (i) direct

 



      
 

 



 

obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, or (iii) commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation; _provided_ _further_ that no loss thereon or thereof shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be promptly paid to Parent. Parent shall
promptly replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of any investment losses.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) Parent shall instruct the Disbursing Agent to mail promptly after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than the tenth (10th) Business Day
thereafter, to each Person who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry
Shares, and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_, a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Disbursing Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate
to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Disbursing Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Disbursing Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Disbursing Agent may reasonably request), in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, less any required withholding of Taxes,
and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or transferred is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered or transferred be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or
transferred or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(d) Until surrendered or transferred, as applicable, in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.2_, all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
(other than Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Shares owned by
Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, Shares held by the Company or
any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes, from and after the Effective Time, only the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration or
transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Shares

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_.
At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock ledger of
the Company shall be closed.

 



 

(f) At any time more than six (6) months after the Effective Time, the
Disbursing Agent shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had
been made available to the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter,
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon due
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such
amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental
unit or agency, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this _Section 3.2_ , none of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Law.

 



 

3.3 _Company Stock Options and Other Payments._

 



 

(a) The Company represents and warrants that each option to acquire Shares
granted under any Company Stock Plan or any other agreement (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ "), that is not fully exercisable as of the date of
this Agreement will automatically become fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan. On the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option, without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or the holder of any such Company Stock Option, shall be canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (i) the Option Consideration multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number
of Shares into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that if the exercise
price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Any payment made pursuant to
this _Section 3.3(a)_ to the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be
reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (A) the
Code, (B) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (C) any other
applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts
shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock
Option for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company, or the Surviving
Corporation, as the

 



      
 

 



 

case may be, shall make the payments in respect of the Company Stock Options
as promptly as practicable following the cancellation of such Company Stock
Options as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_ (but in no event later than
twenty (20) Business Days following the Effective Time) by checks payable to
the holders of such Company Stock Options unless the aggregate amount payable
to a particular individual exceeds $10,000.00, in which event payment may be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon receipt by the
Company of written payment instructions from the relevant option holder. Upon
written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay
to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys payment
obligation under this _Section 3.3(a)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount
to be set forth in such written notice). The Company shall take all requisite
action so that, immediately following such payment, each Company Stock Option
shall be canceled and the applicable Company Stock Plans shall be terminated.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time each Company Restricted Share
shall vest in full. To the extent any Shares that were formerly Company
Restricted Shares have not become Dissenting Shares, upon the Effective Time,
they shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section
3.3(b)_ to the holder of any Company Restricted Share shall be reduced by any
income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (iii) any other applicable
Laws.

 



 

3.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to
the other provisions of this _Section 3.4_ ), Shares that are held by any
record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be canceled and terminated and the holder of such Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting Shares other
than such rights to be paid fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares
as are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall
have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in
each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 3.4_, if the Merger is terminated, rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall
comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with respect to holders of
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, any withdrawals of such demands received by
the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct
and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



      
 

 



 

3.5 _Adjustments_.

 



 

If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur (other than the
exercise of other Company Stock Options), including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 



 

3.6 _Withholding Rights_.

 



 

Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Disbursing Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this _Article III_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. If the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, as the case may be, so withholds such amounts, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 



 

3.7 _Lost Certificates_.

 



 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Disbursing Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV. 
_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except (x) as set forth in the corresponding sections of the Companys
Disclosure Letter, it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section
of the Companys Disclosure Letter (whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears) shall be deemed to be disclosure with respect to any other section of
the Companys Disclosure Letter and any other representation or warranty made
elsewhere in _Article IV_ , in either case, to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure or (y) for any
item disclosed in the Companys SEC Reports filed since January 1, 2010 (other
than any of the Companys SEC Reports filed on or after the date hereof and
excluding any risk factor disclosures and any forward-looking statements or
other statements that do not contain any specific factual information with
respect to any particular item or that are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary that:

corporate or other entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or properties owned, operated
or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently registered, or required to be
registered, as an "investment company" pursuant to the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended.

 



 

4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

Letter, there are no voting trusts, proxies or similar agreements or

voting of any Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Except for Company Stock Options, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations

4.4 _Authorization_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, (assuming the accuracy of the representation and
warranty in _Section 5.10_ ) to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject
to any required approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Required
Company Vote (and assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty in
_Section 5.10_ ), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and (assuming the
accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 5.10_ ) the
consummation by the Company of the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and (assuming the accuracy of the representation
and warranty in _Section 5.10_ ) no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Required Company Vote and the filing of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto and assuming the
accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 5.10_ ) constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other Laws affecting creditors rights
generally or by legal principles of general applicability governing the
availability of equitable remedies.

 



 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board of Directors of the Company
has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (collectively, the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "). Assuming the accuracy of the representation
and warranty in _Section 5.10_ , the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the issued and outstanding Shares to adopt this Agreement
(the " _Required Company Vote_ ") is the only vote of holders of Shares or
other securities (equity or otherwise) of the Company necessary to consummate
the Merger.

 



 

4.5 _Approvals_.

 



 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and (assuming the
accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 5.10_ ) consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to obtain any Authorization or other approval of or from,
or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or
third Person, except (a) for the applicable requirements, if any, of the
Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" Laws, the HSR Act, the Stock
Exchange and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL, (b) as set forth in _Section 4.5_ of the Companys
Disclosure Letter, (c) approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Required Company Vote and (d) such other consents, approvals, authorizations,
permits, actions, filings or notifications, the failure of which to be made or
obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the " _Company
Approvals_ ").

 



 

4.6 _No Violation_.

 



 

Assuming that the Authorizations, approvals, filings and notifications
described in _Section 4.5_ have been obtained or made, except as set forth in
_Section 4.6_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement does not and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (a) conflict with, result

 



      
 

 



 

in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or an event that with
notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default) under, (i)
(assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 5.10_ )
any Law, Regulation or Order applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company
or (iii) the organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries or (b)
conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or an
event that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of, or require a payment under, or result in the loss of any
benefit under, or in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease, license, permit, franchise,
contract or agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
properties or assets is bound, except in the case of matters described in
_clauses (a)(i)_ and _(b)_ of this _Section 4.6_ that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

4.7 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2010, the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed
all of the Companys SEC Reports required to be filed with the SEC. The
Companys SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date of this Agreement, giving
effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date
hereof, (i) complied in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or supplemented, at the date of such amendment or supplement), contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(b) The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (i) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and comply as to form in all material respects with the
then-applicable published Regulations of the SEC and GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except (A) to the extent
required by changes in GAAP, (B) as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
(C) in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act) and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
consistent with past practice).

 



 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liabilities or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued or contingent) that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including the notes thereto), except for liabilities or obligations (i)
reflected or reserved against in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet,
(ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2011 or pursuant to any Material Contract, (iii) arising
out of this Agreement, (iv) arising out of a change of control, or (v) that
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors
(i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for the Companys
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in alerting in a timely fashion the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to

 **ARTICLE V. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY**

 



 

Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that:

 



 

5.1 _Organization_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all
requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted
and is qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or properties owned, operated
or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to have such power or authority, or the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, would not materially
impair the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Subsidiary
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Merger Subsidiary has not engaged and
will not engage in any activities other than in connection with or as
contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent owns all of the outstanding Equity Securities of Merger Subsidiary. The
copy of the limited liability company agreement of Parent and the copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Subsidiary that have
been provided or made available to the Company are complete and correct and in
full force and effect.

 



 

5.2 _Authorization_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and consummation by
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, respectively, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary (such action, the " _Required Action_ ").
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the other party hereto) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary
in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other Laws affecting creditors rights
generally or by legal principles of general applicability governing the
availability of equitable remedies.

 



 

(b) The Board of Directors of Parent has by unanimous approval determined that
this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interest of
Parents equityholders. No vote of the holders of limited liability company
interests or other securities (equity or otherwise) of Parent is necessary to
consummate the Merger.

 



 

5.3 _Approvals_.

 



 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Parent or Merger Subsidiary
to obtain any Authorization or other approval of or from, or to make any
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or third Person,
except (a) for the applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state
securities or "blue sky" Laws, the HSR Act, the Stock Exchange and the filing
and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, (b) the
Required Action, and (c) such other consents, approvals, authorizations,
permits, actions, filings or notifications, the failure of which to be made or
obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Parent
Approvals_ ").

 



 

5.4 _No Violation_.

 



 

Assuming that the Authorizations, approvals, filings and notifications
described in _Section 5.3_ have been obtained or made, the execution and
delivery by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement does not and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (a)
conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or an
event that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default)
under (i) any Law, Regulation or Order applicable to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Merger
Subsidiary or (iii) the organizational documents of Parent, or (b) conflict
with, result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or an event
that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default) under, or
give to others any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of, or require a payment under, or result in the loss of any
benefit under, or in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, lease, license, permit, franchise, contract or
agreement to which Parent or Merger Subsidiary is a party or by which it or

 



      
 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective properties or assets is
bound, except in the case of matters described in _clauses (a)(i)_ and _(b)_
of this _Section 5.4_ that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Litigation_.

 



 

There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (including
regulatory or administrative proceedings or any proceedings in arbitration)
pending against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or
Merger Subsidiary or against any present or former officer or director of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other Person for which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries may be liable or to which any of their respective properties,
assets or rights are reasonably likely to be subject before any Governmental
Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.6 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of an
executed equity commitment letter from the Sponsors to provide equity
financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") to Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary to
which the Company is an express third-party beneficiary pursuant to the terms
and subject to the conditions and limitations thereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ ").

 



 

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by legal
principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies. The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, and has
not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified
in any respect.

 



 

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article IV_ and the compliance by the Company with its obligations under this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy
any condition precedent set forth therein, other than any such default, breach
or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein that has been
waived by the Sponsors or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent to the
satisfaction of the Sponsors.

 



 

(d) The net proceeds from the Equity Financing will be sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the Merger
Consideration, amounts due under _Section 3.3_ and any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) Other than as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Financing (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). To the Knowledge of Parent, no
Person has any right to impose, and none of the Sponsors, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such
funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Equity Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (nor
any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate
amount available under the Equity Commitment Letter on the Closing Date).
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article IV_ and the compliance by the Company with its obligations under this
Agreement, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing, or that
the Equity Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary on
the Closing Date. Parent or Merger Subsidiary has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter that are due as of the date hereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger under this
Agreement, for Parent or Merger Subsidiary to obtain the Equity Financing or
any alternative financing.

 



 

5.7 _Guarantee_.

 



 

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the
Company a duly executed guarantee of the Guarantors with respect to the
Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is the valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors except as enforcement may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other Laws affecting
creditors rights generally or by legal principles of general applicability
governing the availability of equitable remedies, and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantors under such Guarantee.

 



 

5.8 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_.

 



 

Other than this Agreement, the Management Agreements and the Support
Agreement, as of the date hereof there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or
Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any member of the Companys management or the Companys Board of Directors or
any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time. Parent has delivered to the Company true and
complete copies of the Management Agreements and the Support Agreement. As of
the date hereof, each Management Agreement and each Support Agreement
delivered by Parent to the Company is in full force and effect, and has not
been amended or modified in any respect.

 



 

5.9 _Disclosure Documents_.

 



 

None of the information with respect to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates that Parent or Merger Subsidiary
furnishes to the Company specifically for use in the Company Disclosure
Documents or in a Schedule 13E-3, at the time of the filing thereof, at the
time of any distribution or dissemination thereof and at the time such
stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, will contain any untrue
statement of a material

 



      
 

 



 

fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 



 

5.10 _Ownership_.

 



 

Other than as a result of this Agreement and the Support Agreement, none of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or
at any time during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder"
of the Company, as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



 

5.11 _Brokers_.

 



 

No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Sandler ONeill + Partners,
L.P.) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 



 

5.12 _Independent Investigation_.

 



 

In entering into this Agreement and each of the other documents and
instruments relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have each relied solely upon its
own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties provided
by the Company in _Article IV_ , and Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge
and agree that except for the specific representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement (including any that are subject to the
Companys Disclosure Letter and the Companys SEC Reports), (i) none of the
Company, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives makes or has made and (ii) neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has relied upon, any representation or warranty,
either express or implied, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or their business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, financial condition, prospects, projections, budgets,
estimates or operational metrics, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the information (including any statement, document or agreement delivered
pursuant to this Agreement and any financial statements and any projections,
estimates or other forward-looking information) provided (including in any
management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum, certain "data
rooms" maintained by the Company, supplemental information or other materials
or information with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available
to Parent and Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives.

promptly notify Parent in writing of such circumstances and shall not enter

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except (A) to the extent
necessary to permit the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to
take under _Section 6.3(d)_ in full compliance with such provision or (B) to
the extent that the Company has duly effected a Change of Board Recommendation
in accordance with the terms hereof with respect to a proposal by the third
party subject to such Standstill Agreement. The Company shall ensure that its
Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Section 6.3_, and any
violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.3_ by the
Companys Board of Directors (including any committee thereof) or any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the Company; _provided_
that for all purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall not have violated
any of its covenants contained in this _Section 6.3_ in the event that a non-
officer employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries violates a covenant
contained in this _Section 6.3_ and such violation does not lead to or result

practicable (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt of
(i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication that any Person is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any request for
access to the properties, assets or the books and records of the Company or
its Subsidiaries that the Company reasonably believes is reasonably likely to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly
with the identity of such Person, a description of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal, if in writing. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and shall notify Parent promptly
(but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of any material change in the

development.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section
6.3(b)_, prior to the Effective Time, the Company or its Board of Directors
may engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or give access
to the properties, assets or the books and records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, a Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide,
written third party proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that is
submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if (i) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Representatives of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached any of the provisions set forth in
this _Section 6.3_ in any respect, (ii) such Person is not a party to any
Standstill Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except as
otherwise contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)(iv)(A)_ or _Section
6.3(a)(iv)(B)_), (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys legal and
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (after consultation with the
Companys legal advisor) that the failure to take such action could reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary obligations to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, and (iv) the Company
(A) shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement on terms no more
favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and provided a copy of such agreement to Parent and (B) shall concurrently
disclose or make available the same information to Parent as it makes
available to such Person to the extent such information was not previously
disclosed to Parent.

 



 

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, except as provided in this _Section 6.3(e)_ or _Section 6.3(f)_, (i)
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw,
change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal (any action or failure to act described in _clause (i)_ or _clause
(ii)_ of this _Section 6.3(e)_, being a " _Change of Board Recommendation_
") or (iii) approve or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend or
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle or other agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section
6.3(d)(iv)(A)_). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if, at
any time prior to the date on which the Required Company Vote is obtained for
the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys legal and financial advisors) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors
of the Company may (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to
the Superior Proposal and/or (y) if the Effective Time has not occurred,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and
simultaneously enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, but only if (A) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys legal advisors) that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, (B)
the Board of Directors of the Company provides Parent with at least three (3)
Business Days advance

 



      
 

 



 

written notice of the actions described in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ of this
_Section 6.3(e)_ that it intends to take and specifying the material events
giving rise thereto and providing to Parent copies of the drafts of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person making the Superior
Proposal and other material documents related to such Superior Proposal (
_provided_ , that after the giving of such notice, in the event that the
applicable Superior Proposal is materially amended, changed or modified (it
being understood that any amendment, change or modification to the
consideration offered or the conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal would be deemed to be a
material amendment, change or modification), then, upon each such occasion,
the Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent describing such material
amendment, change or modification (and a copy of any document from or on
behalf of the Person making the Superior Proposal relating to such amendment,
change or modification) and a new advance notice period of twenty-four (24)
hours shall be applicable; _provided_ _further_ that in no event shall the
initial three (3) Business Day period be shortened to a period less than three
(3) Business Days) and (C) during such three (3) Business Day period (or later
twenty-four (24) hour period), the Company and its Representatives shall, if
requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives to amend this Agreement so as to enable the Board of Directors
of the Company to determine that the Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal (after taking into account any agreed modifications to the
terms of this Agreement) and at the end of such three (3) Business Day period
(or later twenty-four (24) hour period), the Board of Directors of the Company
maintains its determination that the Superior Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal (after taking into account any agreed modifications to the terms of
this Agreement). The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the first sentence of _Section 6.3(e)_, if, at any time
prior to the date on which the Required Company Vote is obtained for the
Merger, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys legal advisors) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, the Board of
Directors of the Company may at any time prior to the date on which the
Required Company Vote is obtained for the Merger in response to an Intervening
Event effect a Change of Board Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such a Change of Board
Recommendation unless (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
provided Parent with at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice
of its intent to effect a Change of Board Recommendation specifying the
material events giving rise thereto, (ii) during such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company and its Representatives shall have, if requested by
Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives to amend
this Agreement so as to enable the Board of Directors to determine that
failure to effect such Change of Board Recommendation no longer would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, and (iii) Parent shall not
have, during such three (3) Business Day period made an offer to amend this
Agreement that would, upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on Parent and
that after due consideration of such offer in good faith, and (after
consultation with the Companys legal advisors) resulted in the Board of
Directors of the Company concluding that failure to effect such Change of
Board Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to result in a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws;
_provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be permitted
to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 6.3(f)_ with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and solely subject in all respects to
_Section 6.3(e)_).

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal required by Rule 14e-2(a),
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders
in favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation.

 



 

(h) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the provisions of
this _Section 6.3_ shall in no manner apply to or restrict the Companys
actions with respect to the divestiture of interests in the Divestment
Transactions, in each case, on substantially the same terms, as set forth or
described in _Section 6.2(c)_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter, _provided_
, that if the consideration to be received by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in any such transaction shall be less than the amount as set forth or
described in _Section 6.2(c)_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent in writing of such circumstances and shall not
enter into any agreement with respect to or consummate such transaction
without the prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

6.4 _Notices of Certain Events; Consultation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Parent of:

Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
_Section 4.12_ or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any fact or occurrence between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of which it has Knowledge which
makes any of its representations contained in this Agreement untrue in any
material respect or causes any material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable notify the Company of: (i) any notice or other communication of
which Parent has Knowledge from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person (or other Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any notice or other
communication of which Parent has Knowledge from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any

which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iv) any fact or occurrence between the date of this

its representations contained in this Agreement untrue in any material respect
or causes any material breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent prior to making its financial
results for any period publicly available after the date of this Agreement and

obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary contained in

conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to

consummation, as applicable, contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (or any
definitive agreements related thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies
under, the Equity Commitment Letter (or any definitive agreements related
thereto).

 



 

(b) In the event all conditions applicable to the Equity Commitment Letter
have been satisfied and all conditions to the Merger are satisfied or waived,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Sponsors to

perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) to ensure that,
prior to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall not conduct any business
or make any investments other than as specifically

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger
Subsidiary to, take any action that would result in the breach of any
representation and warranty of Parent hereunder such that the Company would
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_.

 



 

(b) Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing
of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Merger
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and
all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations

6.7 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and, when applicable, the
Surviving Corporation, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by Law the current and former officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and liabilities in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including, but
not limited to, amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of
Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
any agreement set forth in _Section 6.7_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter,
in each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and
without amendment thereof. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in
any Legal Proceeding in connection with any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder, then Parent and, when applicable, the Surviving Corporation, shall
advance, to the extent not prohibited by Law, any costs, expenses (including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees) and all other disbursements or
expenses of the types customarily incurred by any Indemnified Party arising
out of, relating to or incurred in connection with such Legal Proceeding. Such
advanced expenses, however, shall be made within twenty (20) days after the
receipt by Parent and, when applicable, the Surviving Corporation, of a
statement or statements requesting such advances (which shall include invoices
received by any Indemnified Party in connection with such expenses) and shall
not include amounts paid in settlement by any Indemnified Party or the amount
of judgments or fines against any Indemnified Party. Advances shall be
unsecured and interest free. The Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal Proceeding
pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and
in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Legal Proceeding or the Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause, including, without limitation, by providing
any necessary funds to meet the obligations of this _Section 6.7_, Merger
Subsidiary to, and Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse in coverage,
provide officers and directors liability insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_")
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend a total premium
during such period in excess of 300% of the per annum rate of the aggregate
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance on the date of
this Agreement (and the Company represents and warrants that such current
premium amount is the amount set forth in _Section 6.7_ of the Companys
Disclosure Letter); _provided_ _further_ , that if the amount of the total
premium for such insurance shall exceed such 300%, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount;
_provided_ _further_ , that in the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, directly or
indirectly, (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
or capital stock of the Surviving Corporation to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. True and complete copies of all
current DandO Insurance policy(ies) have been provided or made available to
Parent. The provisions of the first sentence of this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid (or "tail") DandO Insurance
policy(ies) has been obtained by the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time, which policy(ies) provides such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If such prepaid (or "tail") policy(ies) has been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause, including, without limitation, by providing any necessary funds to meet
the obligations of this _Section 6.7_, the Surviving Corporation to maintain
such policy(ies) in full force and effect in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this _Section 6.7_, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
reimburse all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by any
Person to enforce the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to materially alter the indemnification(s)
provided for under this _Section 6.7_ of any Indemnified Party to whom this
_Section 6.7_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section
6.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_).

 



 

6.8 _Access and Information_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the Company and
Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to the other and
its Representatives appropriate access, at reasonable times upon reasonable
prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of the other and to its books, records, contracts and
documents and (ii) furnish promptly to the other and its Representatives such
information concerning its business, properties, contracts, records and
personnel (including financial,

 



      
 

 



 

operating and other data and information) as may be reasonably requested, from
time to time, by or on behalf of the other party; _provided_ _however_ , that

following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach and (B) the
End Date; _provided_ , that at the time of the delivery of such written
notice, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall be in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) (A) a Change of Board Recommendation shall have occurred (whether or not
in compliance with _Section 6.3_ ), (B) the Company or the Board of Directors
of the Company (or any committee thereof) shall approve, endorse or recommend
or execute or enter into, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement permitted by _Section 6.3(d)(iv)(A)_ ), (C) any tender offer or
exchange offer is commenced by any Person other than Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or any Subsidiary of Parent with respect to the outstanding Shares and the

tender their Shares into such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10)
Business Days after commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, (D)
the Company shall have breached _Section 6.3_ in any material respect, (E) the
Company shall have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation in the

the Company (or any committee thereof) shall authorize or publicly propose to
do any of the actions specified in _clause (A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ , _(D)_ or (E)
of this _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_.

 



 

The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their respective officers, directors,
Representatives or agents, whether prior to or after the execution of this
Agreement.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the party desiring
to terminate shall give written notice to the other party or parties,
specifying the provisions pursuant to which termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party to the other party
hereto immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no termination of this Agreement shall relieve
any party from liability or damages incurred or suffered by a party, to the
extent such liabilities or damages were the result of fraud or any willful and
material breach of _Section 6.3_ in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section
8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination hereof.
When used in this Agreement, the term " _willful and material breach_ " shall
mean a material breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or a
failure to act of a breaching party having actual knowledge that the taking of
the act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_ , whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company, the
Board of Directors, or senior management of the Company, or shall have been
made directly to the stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (not subsequently withdrawn prior to the date
of such termination) to make an Acquisition Proposal and (B) following the
occurrence of an event described in the preceding _clause (A)_ , this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ ( _Failure to close by End Date_ ), _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ ( _Company
breach of representation or warranty_ ) or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Company
breach of covenant_ ) and (C) within twelve (12) months of the date this
Agreement is terminated the Company (1) enters into a definitive agreement to
engage in a transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or (2)
consummates an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 8.3(b)(i)_ , the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ ( _Company receipt of Superior Proposal_ ); or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_
( _Company change in recommendation_ );

 



 

then, the Company shall (i) pay to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated
in writing by Parent (" _Payee_ ") a termination fee of $2,000,000 in cash
(the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
(ii) reimburse Parent and Merger Subsidiary for all of their Expenses, up to a
maximum of $1,000,000 (not later than two (2) Business Days after submission
of statements providing reasonable evidence thereof), it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be required to reimburse Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys Expenses on more than one occasion. Such payments shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to _clause (i)_ of _Section
8.3(b)_ shall be made to Payee on the date of the first to occur of the events
referred to in _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ of _Section 8.3(b)(i)(C)_ ; any payment
required to be made pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be
made to Payee prior to or concurrently with such termination; any payment
required to be made pursuant to _clause (iii)_ of _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be
made to Payee within two (2) Business Days of notice of the occurrence thereof
to the Company; and, in each case, such payment shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
(i) _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ ( _Parent breach of representation or covenant_ ) and
the breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary giving rise to the right of the
Company to terminate this Agreement under such Section is the principal factor
in the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or (ii) _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_
( _Merger Subsidiary failure to consummate the Merger_ ), then within two (2)
Business Days of notice thereof, Parent shall (i) pay to the Company a
termination fee of $5,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) reimburse the Company for
all of its Expenses, up to a maximum of $1,000,000 (not later than two (2)
Business Days after submission of statements providing reasonable evidence
thereof), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to
reimburse the Companys Expenses on more than one occasion. Such payments
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to
be designated by the Company.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where a Termination Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_ are not a
penalty, but rather are a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, with respect to _Section 8.3(b)_, and the Company, with
respect to _Section 8.3(d)_ , for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ , the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in
a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent the Expenses incurred by
the prevailing Party and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at a rate equal
to the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment. Likewise, if Parent fails
to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_ or any portion
thereof, Parent shall pay to the Company the Expenses incurred by the Company
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such
amount or portion thereof at a rate equal to the prime rate reported in The
Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Limitation on Remedies_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except (a) for
the remedy of specific performance to the extent permitted in _Section 9.11_
and (b) with respect to liabilities or damages that were the result of fraud
on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Sponsors, Varde Partners,
Inc. and their respective Affiliates and any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or other Representatives,
members, or other financing sources, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages that arise out of the failure of the transactions under this Agreement
to be consummated or any breach or failure to perform as required hereunder or
otherwise, shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1_ and, to the extent and only to the extent provided in this _Section 8.3_
, to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any Expenses payable
pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ , and upon payment in full of such amounts,
neither the Company nor any other Person shall have any rights or claims
against any of the Parent Related Parties under or relating to this Agreement,
the Guarantee, or the Equity Commitment Letter in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
or the transactions contemplated thereby, nor shall the Company or any other
Person be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against any
of the Parent Related Parties arising out of this Agreement, the Guarantee or
the Equity Commitment Letter, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith or the transactions
contemplated thereby, nor shall any of the Parent Related Parties have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Guarantee, or the Equity Commitment Letter in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company acknowledges that both
Parent and Merger Subsidiary are newly-formed companies and do not have any
material assets except in connection with this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter as expressly set forth herein and therein. The provisions of
this _Section 8.3(f)(i)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Parent Related Parties. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both specific performance as permitted by
_Section 9.11_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Expenses
payable pursuant to S _ection 8.3(d)_ , (i) in no event shall the Company be
entitled to specific performance of this Agreement, the Guarantee or the
Equity Commitment Letter from and after such time as the Company has received
the Parent Termination Fee and Expenses payable pursuant to S _ection 8.3(d)_
and (ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both
(A) a grant of specific performance pursuant to _Section 9.11_ to effect the
consummation of the Merger and (B) the Parent Termination Fee and any Expenses
payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except (a)
for the remedy of specific performance to the extent permitted under _Section
9.11_ and (b) with respect to liabilities or damages that were the result of
fraud in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the part of the Company or any willful and material breach
of _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement on the part of the Company, Parents and
Merger Subsidiarys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company and its respective
Affiliates and any of their respective former, current and future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents or other Representatives, members, or other
financing sources, managers, general or limited partners or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages
that arise out of the failure of the transactions under this Agreement to be
consummated or any breach or failure to perform as required hereunder or
otherwise shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1_ and, to the extent and only to the extent provided in _Section 8.3_ , to
receive payment of the Termination Fee and any Expenses payable pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(b)_, and upon payment in full of such amounts, neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary nor any other Person shall have any rights or
claims against any of the Company Related Parties under or relating to this
Agreement in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other Person be entitled to bring or
maintain any other Legal Proceeding against any of the Company Related Parties
arising out of this Agreement in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor shall any of the Company Related Parties have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parents and Merger Subsidiarys
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Company and any of the Company Related Parties for any
willful and material breach of _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement shall be
limited to actual losses and damages reasonably incurred by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary (including reasonable attorneys fees), and the Company and the
Company Related Parties shall not be liable or otherwise responsible for any
other losses and damages including, but not limited to, exemplary, punitive,
consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages or lost profits, loss
of future revenue or loss of business reputation or opportunity that arise
from any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement under any and
all theories of liability. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger
Subsidiary may pursue both specific performance (as permitted by _Section
9.11_ ) and the payment of the Termination Fee and Expenses payable pursuant
to _Section 8.3(b)_ , (i) in no event shall Parent be entitled to specific
performance of this Agreement from and after such time as Parent has received
the Termination Fee and Expenses and (ii) under no circumstances shall Parent
or Merger Subsidiary be entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific
performance pursuant to _Section 9.11_ to effect the consummation of the
Merger and (B) the Termination Fee and any Expenses payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_.

9.5 _Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Etc_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflict of law hereof.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto, on their behalf and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates, irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such Court or the Delaware Supreme
Court determines that the Court of Chancery does not have or should not
exercise subject matter jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware) and the federal Courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware (and of the appropriate appellate Courts
therefrom) in connection with any dispute arising out of, in connection with,
in respect of, or in any way relating to:

 



 

(i) the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

(ii) the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement
and the documents referred to in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) any actions of or omissions by any Covered Party (as defined below) in
any way connected with, related to or giving rise to any of the foregoing
matters (the foregoing _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ collectively, the "
_Covered Matters_ ");

 



 

and hereby waive, and agree not to assert as a defense in any Legal Proceeding
with regard to or involving a Covered Matter, that such Legal Proceeding may
not be brought or is not maintainable in said Courts or that venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such Courts, and the parties hereto, on their behalf and on
behalf of their respective Affiliates, irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such Legal Proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively by
such a Delaware state or federal Court. The parties hereto, on their behalf
and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby consent to and grant any
such Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with such Legal Proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.1_
or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(c) In addition, by entering into this Agreement, each party hereto, on their
behalf and, to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, on behalf of
their respective equityholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates,
officers or agents, as the case may be, covenants, agrees and acknowledges,
that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding (regardless of the

 



      
 

 



 

legal theory or claim involved or the procedural nature of any such Legal
Proceeding) with regard to any Covered Matter against any Covered Party, other
than the parties hereto.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement, (ii) any breach of this _Section
9.5_ would result in irreparable harm and that monetary damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any such breach and (iii) that any breach of this
_Section 9.5_ will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Accordingly,
each Covered Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction
and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach by a party (or any
affiliate of such party) and in case of any such breach, the non-breaching
party shall be excused from its performance obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

For the purposes of this _Section 9.5_ , " _Covered Party_ " shall mean (i)
any party hereto, (ii) any such parties officers, directors, managers,
agents, employees, or Affiliates or (iii) any officer, director, agent, or
employee of any such Person, all of whom are intended third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 9.5_.

 



 

9.6 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_.

 



 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by
facsimile), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

 



 

9.7 _Entire Agreement_.

 



 

This Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Companys Disclosure Letter, the
Guarantee, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
negotiations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, inducement, promise,
understanding, condition or warranty not set forth herein has been made or
relied upon by either party hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder except for the provisions of _Section 6.7_,
which are intended for the benefit of the Companys former and present
officers and directors, and _Section 9.5_ , which is intended for the benefit
of the Covered Parties. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement (including pursuant to _Sections 6.5, 9.5(c)_ and _9.11_ hereof),
this Agreement may be enforced only against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no
past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, manager, partner, equityholder, agent, attorney or representative of
any party hereto shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or any claim related to
tort or contract theories of Law.

 



      
 

 



 

9.8 _Headings_.

 



 

The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

9.9 _Severability_.

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.

 



 

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

9.11 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.11_,
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in the Federal Court of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), without proof of
actual damages or otherwise. This right is in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity. This right shall include the right of the Company to cause
Parent and Merger Subsidiary to cause the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

 



 

(b) By way of amplification and not limitation of the provisions of _Section
8.3(f)(ii)_ , while Parent and Merger Subsidiary may concurrently seek
specific performance or other equitable relief and monetary damages under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to
effect the consummation of the Merger and a payment of monetary damages,
including the Termination Fee. By way of amplification and not limitation of
the provisions of _Section 8.3(f)(i)_ , while the Company may concurrently
seek specific performance or other equitable relief and monetary damage, under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of a specific performance or other equitable relief to effect the
consummation of the Merger and payment of monetary damages including the
Parent Termination Fee. Subject only to the possible entitlement to specific
performance as set forth in this _Section 9.11_ or as permitted pursuant to
_Section 8.3(f)_ , in no event shall any Parent Related Party have any

 



      
 

 



 

liability under or in respect of this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Equity
Commitment Letter or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith or in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in excess of an aggregate amount equal to the
Parent Termination Fee and the maximum amount of Expenses for which Parent may
be liable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)(ii)_.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement from and after such time as Parent has
(i) terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and (ii) received
the Termination Fee and Expenses payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to specific
performance of this Agreement from and after such time as the Company has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ and received the Parent
Termination Fee and Expenses payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



 

(d) The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger and each party hereto hereby
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
such party when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in accordance

FIFTH. The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

 



 

SIXTH. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
statute, the board of directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
make, adopt, alter, amend or repeal the By-laws of the corporation.

 



 

SEVENTH. Meetings of the stockholders may be held within or without the State
of Delaware, as the By-laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be
kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
board of directors of the Corporation or in the By-laws of the corporation.
Elections of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot unless
the By-laws of the corporation shall so provide.

 



 

EIGHTH. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by the DGCL, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 



 

NINTH. (a) A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable either
to the Corporation or to any stockholder for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except (i) for any breach of the directors duty
of loyalty to the Corporation or

 



      
 

 



 

its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions which are not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law; (iii)
for any matter in respect of which such director shall be liable under Section
174 of Title 8 of the DGCL or any amendment thereto or successor provision
thereto; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director shall have
derived an improper personal benefit. Neither amendment nor repeal of this
paragraph (a) nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this paragraph (a)
shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this paragraph (a) in respect of any
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this
paragraph (a) of this Article, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment,
repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

 



 

(b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to, or testifies in, any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative in nature, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding to the full extent permitted by law, and the
Corporation may adopt by-laws or enter into agreements with any such person
for the purpose of providing for such indemnification.

 



 

(c) To the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article, or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against

a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding
may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such officer or director to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation against such expenses as authorized by this Article, and the
Corporation may adopt by-laws or enter into agreements with such persons for
the purpose of providing for such advances.

 



 

(e) The indemnification permitted by this Article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled, or any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding an office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, the
Corporation shall not indemnify or advance expenses to any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or testifies in, any
threatened, pending or completed

 



      
 

 



 

action, suit or proceeding if such action, suit or proceeding is based upon or
arises out of or is in connection with an event, act or omission occurring
prior to October 31, 1992.

 



 

(g) The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Article or otherwise.
