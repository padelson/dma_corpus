          the Closing Date (the "Closing  Indebtedness")  based on the Estimated
          Balance Sheet;

               (iii) if the  Estimated  Working  Capital (as  defined  below) is
          greater than zero, then plus the amount by which the Estimated Working
          Capital exceeds zero, or if the Estimated Working Capital is less than
          zero, then minus the amount by which the Estimated  Working Capital is
          less than zero.

     Immediately  prior to the  Closing,  Sellers  shall  cause the  Company  to
distribute  all of  its  cash  and  cash  equivalents  as of  the  Closing  Date
(excluding cash or cash equivalents (i) supporting  payment or performance bonds
or similar  instruments or deposits or (ii) reserved for the Portland  Franchise
Dispute,  if any, such amount referred to as "Excluded Cash") (the cash and cash
equivalents  to be  distributed  as aforesaid  being referred to as the "Closing
Cash"),  based on the Estimated  Balance Sheet (as defined below) but subject to
adjustment as set forth below.

          (b) Sellers  shall cause the Company to deliver to  Purchaser at least
     three (3) Business  Days prior to the Closing  Date,  an estimated  balance
     sheet (the "Estimated  Balance  Sheet"),  showing the estimated  amounts of
     Closing Cash and Closing  Indebtedness,  along with a reasonable estimation
     of Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Working Capital")
     prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent
     basis with the  Financial  Statements  but not subject to the exception set
     forth in Section  3.7(a)(ii)(z)),  and a notice  specifying  the "Estimated
     Purchase  Price" after giving effect to such  deductions from and additions
     to the Gross Purchase Price based on the Estimated Balance Sheet (including
     the estimates of Closing  Indebtedness and Closing Cash reflected  therein)
     and the Estimated  Working Capital.  Purchaser shall have an opportunity to
     review and object to the Estimated  Balance Sheet, such review to be prompt
     and any objection to be reasonable and in good faith. Parent shall consider
     such objections in good faith but Parent's reasonable  determination of the
     Estimated  Working  Capital  shall be final and  binding  for  purposes  of
     Closing.


                                       12

          (c) Working Capital. For purposes of this Agreement, "Working Capital"
     means the excess of  "current  assets" of the Company  (other than  Closing
     Cash) over "current  liabilities" of the Company,  determined in good faith
     using the same accounting principles,  practices,  procedures, policies and
     methods that were employed by the Company in  preparation  of the Financial
     Statements;  provided,  however,  that (1) "current  liabilities" shall (x)
     exclude the current  portion of any pre-paid IRU obligation and the current
     portion of any  Closing  Indebtedness,  (y)  include an accrual of $200,000
     with respect to the  Company's  paid time off  obligations,  and (z) to the
     extent  provided  in Section  5.10(b),  reduce  the  accrual  for  interest
     associated with the Portland  Franchise  Dispute,  and (2) "current assets"
     shall (x) exclude Excluded Cash relating to the Portland  Franchise Dispute
     to the extent there is not a corresponding  liability  included in "current
     liabilities" and (y) exclude  pre-paid  licenses to the extent the pre-paid
     licenses become assets of the Company in connection with Section 5.20(b).

     2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.  The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set
forth in this Section 2.3.

          (a) Calculation of Final Working Capital. On or before forty-five (45)
     Business Days after the Closing  Date,  Parent shall deliver to Purchaser a
     balance sheet,  dated as of the Closing Date, in reasonable detail (and, in
     any event,  in no less detail than the Latest  Balance  Sheet)  prepared in
     good faith and in accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent  basis with
     the  Financial  Statements  but not subject to the  exception  set forth in
     Section  3.7(a)(ii)(z))  (the "Proposed  Final Balance  Sheet") showing the
     amounts of Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness,  along with a calculation
     of the Working  Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Proposed Final Working
     Capital"  and  collectively  with the Proposed  Final  Balance  Sheet,  the
     "Proposed Final Statements") based on the Proposed Final Balance Sheet. The
     Proposed Final Statements shall be accompanied by an officer's  certificate
     of Parent  certifying  that the Proposed Final  Statements were prepared in
     good faith in a manner consistent with this Agreement.  Upon receipt of the
     Proposed Final Statements, Purchaser shall have timely access to all of the
     books and records of the  Company or Parent with  respect to or relating to
     the Company  related to the  calculation of the Proposed Final  Statements,
     including all of the detail and work papers used in Parent's preparation of
     the  Proposed  Final  Statements.  Within  twenty  (20)  Business  Days  of
     Purchaser's  receipt of such Proposed Final Statements,  Purchaser may give
     written notice to Parent that it disputes certain items contained in any of
     the Proposed Final Statements (the "Dispute Notice") which shall specify in
     reasonable  detail the dollar amount,  if known, of any objection and basis
     therefor;  provided,  however, that if Purchaser does not deliver a Dispute
     Notice  by such  date,  Purchaser  will be  deemed  to have  accepted  such
     Proposed Final  Statements and the Proposed Final Statements shall be final
     and binding on Purchaser and Sellers.  Upon timely  delivery of the Dispute
     Notice,  Purchaser  and Parent agree to confer in good faith with regard to
     the disputed  items and an  appropriate  adjustment  to the Proposed  Final
     Statements shall be made to the extent agreed upon by Purchaser and Parent.
     If within  twenty (20) Business  Days after  delivery of a Dispute  Notice,
     Purchaser  and Parent are unable to resolve the matter,  either of them may
     within twenty (20) Business Days after the end of the previous  twenty (20)
     Business Day period notify in writing (i) the other party and (ii) Deloitte
     & Touche LLP or another firm of independent accountants selected jointly by
     Purchaser and Parent (the  "Reviewing  Accountant"),  who shall  adjudicate
     only those  items  still in dispute  with  respect  to the  Proposed  Final
     Statements.  Purchaser  and Parent  shall have the  opportunity  to provide
     written  submissions  regarding  their  positions on the disputed  matters,
     which written submissions shall be provided to the Reviewing Accountant, if
     at all, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of referral
     of the disputed matters to the Reviewing  Accountant.  The determination of
     the Reviewing  Accountant shall be based solely on the written  submissions
     by Purchaser and Parent and their respective  representatives and shall not
     be by independent review. The Reviewing  Accountant shall deliver a written
     report  resolving only the disputed matters and setting forth the basis for

                                       13
<PAGE>

     such resolution within thirty (30) Business Days after Purchaser and Parent
     have submitted in writing (or have had the opportunity to submit in writing
     but have not  submitted)  their  positions  as to the disputed  items.  The
     determination  of the Reviewing  Accountant with respect to the correctness
     of each  matter in  dispute  shall be final and  binding on  Purchaser  and
     Sellers.  The fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be
     borne  entirely by the party whose  assertions  regarding the Final Working
     Capital,  Final Closing Cash and Final Closing  Indebtedness  differ in the
     aggregate  by the greatest  amount from the Final  Working  Capital,  Final
     Closing  Cash  and  Final  Closing  Indebtedness,   in  the  aggregate,  as
     determined by the Reviewing  Accountant.  The closing  balance sheet agreed
     upon by Purchaser and Parent (or deemed  accepted by Purchaser)  under this
     subsection,  as adjusted, if necessary based on a decision by the Reviewing
     Accountant hereunder,  is referred to herein as the "Closing Balance Sheet"
     and the final  calculation of the Closing Cash,  Closing  Indebtedness  and
     Working  Capital  reflected on such Closing Balance Sheet shall be referred
     to as the "Final  Closing Cash," "Final  Closing  Indebtedness"  and "Final
     Working Capital," respectively.

          (b) Purchase Price Adjustment.

               (i) If the  Final  Working  Capital  is less  than the  Estimated
          Working  Capital,  then the  Purchase  Price shall be decreased by the
          difference.

               (ii) If the Final  Working  Capital is greater than the Estimated
          Working  Capital,  then the  Purchase  Price shall be increased by the
          difference.

               (iii) If the Final Closing  Indebtedness is less than the Closing
          Indebtedness  reflected  on the  Estimated  Balance  Sheet,  then  the
          Purchase Price shall be increased by the difference.

               (iv) If the  Final  Closing  Indebtedness  is  greater  than  the
          Closing  Indebtedness  reflected on the Estimated  Balance Sheet, then
          the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the difference.

               (v) If the  Final  Closing  Cash is less  than the  Closing  Cash
          reflected on the  Estimated  Balance  Sheet,  then the Purchase  Price
          shall be decreased by the difference.

               (vi) If the Final  Closing  Cash is greater than the Closing Cash
          reflected on the  Estimated  Balance  Sheet,  then the Purchase  Price
          shall be increased by the difference.

     If the Purchase Price,  adjusted as provided above (the "Adjusted  Purchase
Price"),  is greater than the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser at Closing,  then
Purchaser shall pay to Parent the difference between the Adjusted Purchase Price
and the Purchase Price paid at Closing.  If the Adjusted  Purchase Price is less
than the Purchase  Price paid by Purchaser at Closing,  then Parent shall pay to
Purchaser the  difference  between the Adjusted  Purchase Price and the Purchase
Price paid at Closing.  Any payment due pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be
made within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet becomes final
and  binding as  provided  in Section  2.3(a) by wire  transfer  of  immediately
available funds.

     2.4 Allocation. Schedule 2.4 sets forth an allocation of the Purchase Price
(and all  liabilities  of the Company  treated as assumed by Purchaser and other
capitalized  costs  includible  in the amount  deemed paid for such assets,  for
Income Tax purposes;  provided,  however,  that for the avoidance of doubt,  any
pre-paid IRU  obligations  shall not be includible in the amount deemed paid for
the assets of the  Company)  among the  assets of the  Company  (other  than the
Retained  Assets) in  accordance  with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, as  appropriate).  Purchaser  and Sellers and their  respective  Affiliates
shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including,  but not limited to IRS Forms
8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with Schedule 2.4. Neither
Purchaser,  Sellers  nor any of  their  respective  Affiliates  shall  take  any
position  (whether in audits,  Tax Returns or otherwise)  which is  inconsistent
with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.


                                       14
<PAGE>

     2.5 Retained Assets; Elimination of Intercompany Debt. It is understood and
agreed by Purchaser that the Company shall transfer all of the Company's  right,
title and interest in, to and under the Retained Assets to an entity  designated
by Parent prior to the Closing and  Purchaser  shall not acquire any interest in
the  Retained   Assets  (or  any  interest   therein)  in  connection  with  the
transactions contemplated hereby.  Immediately prior to the Closing, in order to
extinguish  all  intercompany  indebtedness  owed to or by the  Company by or to
Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers,  Sellers shall contribute to the capital of
the Company all intercompany  indebtedness owed by the Company to Sellers or any
Affiliate  of  Sellers,  and the  Company  shall  distribute  to CU Capital as a
Retained Asset all intercompany  indebtedness  owed to the Company by Sellers or
any  Affiliate of Sellers.  Parent shall pay and be solely  responsible  for any
Taxes  that  may  result  from  the  transfer  of  the  Retained  Assets  or the
cancellation and extinguishment of the intercompany indebtedness.

     2.6 Purchase  Deposit.  Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser has deposited $1.5 million with Parent to be held as provided  herein.
At the Closing,  Sellers shall credit the amount of such deposit,  along with an
amount  equal to 4.3% per annum on the deposit  calculated  from the date of the
deposit to the  application  of the deposit in  accordance  with this  Agreement
(such amount, along with the $1.5 million deposit, the "Deposit") as part of the
Purchase  Price,  and such amount shall  reduce the amount  payable by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.2(a). If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section
8.4(c) (if such  termination is a result of  Purchaser's  failure to fulfill any
obligation  under this  Agreement  or the failure to satisfy the  condition  set
forth in Section 6.9),  8.4(d),  or 8.4(f) then Parent shall retain such amount.
If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason,  the Deposit shall be paid
by Parent to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of such termination.

                                   ARTICLE 3.
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

     Sellers each  represent and warrant to Purchaser as follows,  except as set

Company were issued in  violation or  contravention  of any  securities  Laws or
regulations  or in violation of any  preemptive  rights of any person or entity.
The Purchased Interests are not represented by certificates.

          (a) The Company is a limited liability company validly existing and in
     good  standing  under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the limited
     liability  company  power  and  authority  to own,  lease and  operate  its
     properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company is
     duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction
     where the conduct of its business or ownership of its  properties  requires
     such  qualification,  except  where the  failure  to so  qualify  would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Except  for  Electric  Lightwave  NY,  LLC (the  "Subsidiary"),  a
     Delaware limited liability company, and as set forth on Schedule 3.3(b)(i),
     the Company does not own or control,  directly or indirectly,  any interest
     in any entity.  As of the date hereof,  the Company owns all the issued and
     outstanding  ownership and membership interests in the Subsidiary.  None of
     Sellers,  the  Company  or the  Subsidiary  is a party  to or  bound by any
     Agreement to Sell or Option  Agreement with respect to the Subsidiary.  The
     Subsidiary  is a limited  liability  company  validly  existing and in good
     standing  under  the laws of the  State  of  Delaware  and has the  limited

contemplated   hereby  and  the  performance  by  Sellers  of  their  respective
obligations  hereunder,  assuming  the  receipt  of  the  Governmental  Required
Consents and the consents,  approvals  and waivers  listed on Schedule 3.4, will
not:  (a) violate or conflict  with any term,  condition or provision of (i) the
charter,  operating agreement,  by-laws or analogous  organizational document of
either  of  Sellers  or the  Company,  (ii) any  agreement,  lease,  instrument,
mortgage,  License or  franchise  to which either of Sellers or the Company is a
party or by which any of their respective  properties are bound (other than with
respect  to the  Retained  Assets),  or (iii)  any Law  applicable  to either of
Sellers or the Company and which  violation  would,  in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii),  reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect;  or (b)
result in the  creation of any Lien upon any of the  properties  material to the

                                       16
<PAGE>

Company  (or any  interest of Sellers in the  Company) or give to others  (other
than to  Purchaser)  any interest or right in any of their  respective  material
properties, including a right to purchase any of such properties. Except for the
Governmental  Required  Consents,  and for  such  consents,  authorizations  and
approvals as set forth on Schedule 3.4, no authorization,  consent,  or approval
of, or filing with, any  Governmental  Authority is required in connection  with
the execution  and delivery of, or  performance  by Sellers of their  respective
obligations under, this Agreement.  Except for the consents,  authorizations and
approvals set forth on Schedule 3.4, any consents,  authorizations and approvals
in connection with the Retained  Assets,  and those, the failure to obtain which
would  not  result  in  the  loss  of  a  material  right  of  the  Company,  no
authorization,  consent or approval of, or filing with, any third-party  that is
not a  Governmental  Authority is required in connection  with the execution and
delivery of, or performance by Sellers of their  respective  obligations  under,
this Agreement.

     3.5 Real Property; Network and Condition of Assets.

          (a) Owned Real  Property.  Schedule  3.5(a)  lists each parcel of real
     property owned by the Company (other than the Retained Assets) along with a
     corresponding  street address for each parcel (the "Owned Real  Property").
     The  Company is the sole owner in fee simple  title of each parcel of Owned
     Real Property.  The Company has good and marketable title to each parcel of
     Owned  Real  Property,  free and clear of any Liens  other  than  Permitted
     Liens.  No  Owned  Real  Property,  including  buildings  and  improvements
     thereon,  is in material  violation  of any  material  zoning,  land use or
     similar Laws. To Sellers'  knowledge,  there are no Laws requiring material
     repair, alteration or correction of any existing condition on any parcel of
     Owned Real Property.  To Sellers'  knowledge,  the premises  located on the
     Owned Real Property are in good condition and repair and are sufficient for
     the Business being conducted  thereon,  ordinary wear and tear excepted and
     subject  to  normal  maintenance  and  repair  in the  ordinary  course  of
     business.

          (b) Leased Real  Property.  Schedule  3.5(b)  describes  all  material
     leases, subleases,  licenses,  easements, rights of way and other occupancy
     agreements,  including network and line leases,  (each of the foregoing,  a
     "Real Property  Agreement" and the premises leased thereunder,  the "Leased
     Real  Property,"  which is referred to herein  collectively  with the Owned
     Real Property as the "Real  Property") to which the Company is a party. The
     Real  Property  Agreements  are  the  only  leases,  subleases,   licenses,
     easements, rights-of-way or other occupancy agreements that are material to
     the operation of the Business in the ordinary course as presently conducted
     by the  Company.  The  Company  does not use or occupy  any  material  Real
     Property,  including  buildings,  improvements and points of presence,  for
     which the Company does not have a right to use or occupy such material Real
     Property pursuant to a Real Property Agreement.  The Company has a good and
     valid  leasehold  interest  in and to, and is in  occupancy  of, all of the
     Leased Real Property  under which it is a tenant or lessee,  free and clear
     of any Liens other than  Permitted  Liens.  All Leased Real Property of the
     Company that is material to the Business is in all material respects in the
     condition  required  of such  property  by the  terms of the Real  Property
     Agreement  applicable  thereto and is in adequate condition for its current
     operation and use.

          (c) Certain Network  Agreements.  Schedule  3.5(c)(i) lists all of the
     Franchise Agreements, including each modification, amendment and supplement
     thereto.  Schedule  3.5(c)(ii)  lists (i) each  interconnection  or similar
     agreement  that is necessary to the  operation of the Business as currently
     conducted  by the  Company,  including  each  modification,  amendment  and
     supplement  thereto  ("Interconnection   Agreement"),   together  with  the
     counterparty,   and  (ii)  each   material   telecommunications   and  data
     carrier/vendor  or similar  agreement (other than any Retained  Contracts),
     including each  modification,  amendment and supplement  thereto  ("Carrier
     Agreement"),   together  with  the   counterparty.   Each   Interconnection
     Agreement,  including each amendment or modification thereto and each other
     Communications Contract, including any access charge arrangements, that, in
     each  case,  are  required  to be  filed  by the  Company,  or to  Sellers'
     knowledge,  except as set forth on  Schedule  3.5(c)(iii),  the other party

                                       17
<PAGE>

     thereto, with a Governmental Authority, has been duly and timely filed with
     the  appropriate  Governmental  Authority.  Except as set forth on Schedule
     3.5(c)(iv), there are no written, or to Sellers' knowledge, other, disputes
     or claims of any kind over $100,000 (individually or in the aggregate) with
     respect to any of the Network  Agreements.  Except as set forth on Schedule
     3.5(c)(v), there are no written, or to Sellers' knowledge, other, claims or
     notices  from a third  party  alleging  or  advising  the  Company  that it
     considers  the  Company  liable for any tariff or other  payment of due but
     unpaid  interstate or intrastate  access charges or it believes the Company
     has  provided  services to Voice over IP services  providers  or other data
     service  providers  that are claimed to be in violation of federal or state
     Law or that  have  caused  the  Company  to be  liable  for  intrastate  or
     interstate access charges or other fees or charges that the Company has not
     paid.  Schedule 3.5(c)(vi) lists each payment or performance bond or letter
     of credit or other credit support for the Company's  obligations  under any
     Network Agreement (regardless of the Person providing such support).

          (d)  Metropolitan  Access Network.  Sellers have provided to Purchaser
     maps  showing  in  reasonable  detail  the  Metropolitan   Access  Network,
     including,  in reasonable  detail, (i) the switching and transport network,

     3.7, and the Audited  Financial  Statements,  when  delivered to Purchaser,
     will:

               (i) have been  prepared  from,  and are in accordance  with,  the
          books and records of the Company,

               (ii) have been  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP  applied on a
          consistent  basis during the periods  involved (except with respect to
          the Financial Statements (x) for the absence of footnotes, (y) for the
          absence  of  normal  year-end  adjustments,  and (z) with  respect  to
          determining materiality for purposes of GAAP, the Financial Statements
          were prepared based on materiality  relating to the Parent rather than
          materiality   relating  to  the  Company  and  the   Subsidiary  on  a
          stand-alone basis (collectively the "GAAP Exceptions")),


                                       20
<PAGE>

               (iii) present fairly,  in all material  respects (with respect to
          the  Company),  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as of  the

          Company for the periods presented.

     (b) The books of account and other  financial  records of the Company:  (i)
reflect all  material  items of income and expense and all  material  assets and
liabilities  required to be reflected therein in accordance with GAAP applied on

the Company and each  territory of  operation  for each of the nine months ended

were  derived from the books and records of the Company and reflect what Sellers
believe to be a reasonably  appropriate  allocation of revenue and expense among
the Company's territories, which allocation methodologies have been applied on a
consistent basis through the periods referred to above and on a basis consistent
with past  preparation of such  statements by the Company and Parent.  Given the
allocation  methodologies referred to above, the Internal P&L Statements,  taken
as a whole, fairly present, in all material respects,  the information set forth
therein. The Internal P&L Statements eliminate, or do not reflect,  intercompany
revenue.

     (d)  Schedule  3.7(d) sets forth the churn,  renewals  and new sold monthly
recurring  revenue by channel of the Company  for (i) each of the twelve  months

2005 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Such  information is derived
directly  from the  Company's  billing  systems and is presented on a consistent
basis through the periods referred to above and consistent with past preparation
by the Company and Parent.

contingent  or  otherwise)  ("Liability"),   including  any  Liability  for  any
Indebtedness,  except: (i) Liabilities  reflected or reserved against in, or set
forth on, the Latest Balance Sheet;  (ii)  liabilities that are disclosed in the
Schedules;  and (iii)  Liabilities that either (A) were incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the Latest Balance Sheet,  (B) would not be required to
be  reflected  on,  reserved  against  or set forth on a balance  sheet or notes
thereto,  prepared in accordance  with GAAP (with respect to the Company) or (C)
are not material in amount or  significance  to the Company.  The Company has no
capital lease obligations, other than as set forth on Schedule 1.1(a).

     (f) Parent maintains internal controls over financial reporting  ("Internal
Controls") which are designed to provide reasonable assurance,  but not absolute
assurance,  that (i) records are maintained in reasonable  detail, to accurately
and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the
Company;  (ii)  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures
of the  Company  are  being  made  only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of
management  and  directors  of the Company;  and (iii)  access to the  Company's
assets is permitted  only in  accordance  with  management's  authorization.  No
representation  or warranty  is made in this  Section  3.7(f) that the  Parent's
Internal Controls will prevent all error or all fraud.

     (g) The notes and accounts receivable of the Company are reflected properly
in all  material  respects  on its books and records and have arisen out of bona
fide sales and  deliveries of goods,  performance of services and other business
transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

     announcement  (written or oral) by the Company, any of its ERISA Affiliates
     or any other  Person  relating to, or change in  participation  or coverage
     under,  any Company Benefit Plan that,  either alone or together with other
     such items or events,  could materially increase the expense to the Company
     of  maintaining  such Company  Benefit Plan (or the Company  Benefit  Plans
     taken as a whole) above the level of expense  incurred with respect thereto
     for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements.

          (c) All of the Company  Benefit  Plans comply (and have,  at all times
     complied)  in form  and in  operation  in all  material  respects  with all
     applicable  requirements  of Law and  each  Company  Benefit  Plan has been
     administered  at all times and in all material  respects in accordance with
     its terms. All of the Parent Plans comply (and have, at all times complied)
     in form and in operation with all applicable requirements of Law, including
     the Code and ERISA and have been  administered in all material  respects in
     accordance  with their terms,  except,  in each case,  for such  compliance
     failures and/or administration failures that would not result in a material
     liability  to  the  Company.   There  has  been  no  nonexempt  "prohibited
     transactions" (as described in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
     Code) with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans that could result in
     a material liability to the Company.

          (d) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified  under  Section
     401(a)  of  the  Code  (i)  is  the  subject  of  an  unrevoked   favorable
     determination  letter  from the IRS with  respect to its  qualified  status
     under the Code, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent
     legislation,  including,  without  limitation,  that  legislation  commonly
     referred  to as "GUST" and  "EGTRRA,"  (ii) has  remaining a period of time
     under the Code or applicable Treasury  regulations or IRS pronouncements in
     which to  request,  and make any  amendments  necessary  to obtain,  such a
     letter from the IRS, or (iii) is a prototype or volume  submitter plan that
     is  entitled,  under IRS  Announcement  2001-77,  to rely on the  favorable
     opinion or advisory  letter  issued by the IRS to the  prototype  or volume
     submitter plan sponsor of the Seller Savings Plan. Nothing has occurred, or
     is  reasonably  expected by the Company or any of its ERISA  Affiliates  to
     occur,  that could adversely  affect the  qualification or exemption of the
     Seller Savings Plan or its related trust or group annuity contract.

          (e) With  respect to each  Benefit Plan  sponsored  or  maintained  or
     contributed  to (or required to be sponsored or maintained  or  contributed
     to) by the  Company or any of its ERISA  Affiliates  at any time during the
     last six  years  that is  subject  to Title IV or  Section  302 of ERISA or
     Section  601 et seq.  of ERISA or Section  412,  4971 or 4980B of the Code,
     there does not now exist, nor, to Sellers' knowledge,  do any circumstances
     exist that could  result in, any  Controlled  Group  Liability  (as defined

                                       24
<PAGE>

     below) that would be a  liability  of the Company  following  the  Closing.
     "Controlled  Group  Liability"  means any  liability  (i) under Title IV or
     Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code or (ii) as a result
     of the failure to comply with the  continuation  coverage  requirements  of
     Section 601 et seq.  of ERISA or Section  4980B of the Code,  and,  without
     limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
     has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or
     4212 of ERISA.  For purposes of this Agreement,  "ERISA  Affiliate"  means,
     with respect to any entity,  trade or business,  any other entity, trade or
     business that is a member of a group described in Section 414(b),  (c), (m)
     or (o) of the Code or Section  4001(b)(1)  of ERISA that includes the first
     entity,  trade or  business,  or that is a member  of the same  "controlled
     group"  as  the  first  entity,  trade  or  business  pursuant  to  Section
     4001(a)(14) of ERISA.  Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA  Affiliates
     has sponsored or maintained or  contributed to (or been required to sponsor
     or maintain or contribute  to) any Benefit Plan that is (or was) subject to
     Title IV of ERISA or  Section  302 of ERISA or  Section  412 or 4971 of the
     Code and that covered  employees of the Company at any time during the last
     six years.

          (f) Except as set forth on Schedule  3.11(f)  and for the  accelerated
     vesting  under the Seller  Savings  Plan  contemplated  by Section  5.5(c),
     neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement nor the  consummation
     of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or in
     conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
     funding or delivery  of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
     benefit to any employee,  officer or director of the Company,  or result in
     any  limitation on the right of the Company to amend,  merge,  terminate or
     receive a reversion of assets from any Company  Benefit Plan or Parent Plan
     or related  trust.  The terms of each Company  Benefit Plan and Parent Plan
     permit the Company or Seller,  as  applicable,  to amend and terminate such
     Benefit Plan or permit the Company to terminate its  participation  therein
     at any  time  and for any  reason  without  penalty  and  without  material
     liability  or  expense.  None of the  rights  of the  Company  or any ERISA
     Affiliate  under  any  Benefit  Plan  will be  impaired  in any way by this
     Agreement or the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
     Agreement.

          (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(g),  none of the Company, any
     of its ERISA  Affiliates or any Benefit Plan provides or has any obligation
     to  provide  (or  contribute  toward  the  cost  of)   post-employment   or
     post-termination benefits of any kind, including, without limitation, death
     and  medical  benefits,  with  respect to any  current  or former  officer,
     employee,  agent, director or independent  contractor of the Company, other
     than (i)  continuation  coverage  mandated by  Sections  601 through 608 of
     ERISA and Section 4980B(f) of the Code, (ii) retirement  benefits under any
     Benefit Plan that is qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code, and (iii)
     deferred  compensation  that  is  accrued  as a  current  liability  on the
     Financial Statements.

          (h) There are no actions,  suits or claims (other than routine  claims
     for benefits) pending or, to Sellers' knowledge, threatened with respect to
     (or against the assets of) (i) any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) any Parent
     Plan that would  result in a material  liability  to the  Company,  nor, to
     Sellers'  knowledge,  is there a basis for any such action,  suit or claim.
     None of the Company  Benefit Plans nor the Seller Savings Plan is currently
     under  investigation,  audit or  review,  directly  or  indirectly,  by any
     Governmental  Authority,  and,  to  Sellers'  knowledge,  no such action is
     contemplated  or under  consideration  by any  Governmental  Authority.  No
     Parent Benefit Plan is currently  under  investigation,  audit or review by
     any Governmental  Authority,  and, to Sellers' knowledge, no such action is
     contemplated or under consideration by any Governmental  Authority, in each
     case,  to the extent  that  would  result in a  material  liability  to the
     Company.

     3.12 Material Contracts. Schedule 3.12 lists all of the Material Contracts.
Except as set forth on  Schedule  3.12,  the  Company  is not in  receipt of any
written claim (or to Sellers' knowledge,  oral claim) of breach of or failure to
comply with any, and the Company is not in material breach of and is in material
compliance with each,  Material  Contract.  To Sellers'  knowledge,  each of the

                                       25
<PAGE>

other parties to the Material  Contracts has performed all material  obligations
required to be performed by such party,  and is not in material  default  under,
any Material Contract, and except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(b), no event has
occurred  that,  with  notice and lapse of time,  or both,  would  constitute  a
material  default  or give  rise  to a  right  in the  counterparty  thereto  to
terminate such Material  Contract prior to the stated term thereof.  Each of the
Material Contracts is a valid and binding obligation of the Company,  is in full
force and effect,  and to Sellers'  knowledge,  is enforceable by the Company in
accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as  may  be  limited  by  (i)  applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,  reorganization or similar Laws from time to
time in effect  which  affect  creditors'  rights  generally,  or (ii) legal and
equitable  limitations on the availability of specific  remedies.  True, correct
and complete  copies of all Material  Contracts,  including  all  modifications,
amendments and  supplements,  have been provided or made available to Purchaser.
No counterparty to any Material Contract has notified the Company in writing or,
to Sellers'  knowledge,  otherwise,  of its intent to  terminate  such  Material
Contract.

     3.13 Communications Licenses. Schedule 3.13 lists all of the Communications
Licenses,  which include any renewals,  extensions or modifications thereof, and
any pending  applications for any  Communications  Licenses.  The Company is the
authorized   legal   holder  of  the   Communications   Licenses.   All  of  the
Communications  Licenses  are  valid  and  in  full  force  and  effect  and  no
Communications  License is subject to any condition or  requirement  that is not
generally imposed on such  authorizations.  The Company holds all Communications
Licenses  required  under  applicable  Law  for  the  current  operation  of the
Business.  Except as set forth on  Schedule  3.13,  the  Company  (i) is and has
operated  in  all  material  respects  in  compliance  with  all  terms  of  the
Communications  Licenses;  (ii) is in compliance in all material  respects with,
and the conduct of the Business by the Company is in  compliance in all material
respects with, the  Communications  Act and any applicable  state or local Laws,
including  those of State  PUCs,  and  (iii) has  filed  all  registrations  and
renewals and all other material  reports and other  applicable  documents (which
are complete and accurate in all material  respects) and paid all required fees,
including any renewal  applications,  required by the  Communications Act or any
applicable state or local Laws,  including those of State PUCs. There is not now
pending or, to Sellers'  knowledge,  threatened,  any action or proceeding by or
before the FCC or any State PUC in which the requested remedy is the revocation,
suspension,   cancellation,   rescission   or   modification   of   any  of  the
Communications  Licenses or the  imposition of a monetary fine or other penalty.
To  Sellers'  knowledge,  no Person has  asserted  in writing to a  Governmental
Authority,  and no  Governmental  Authority  has  asserted in writing,  that any
Communications License should be suspended,  cancelled,  revoked or modified, or
that the  Company  is not in  compliance  with any  Communications  License.  To
Sellers'  knowledge,   no  event  has  occurred  that  permits  the  suspension,
cancellation,  or revocation of any Communications License, or the imposition of
any restriction  thereon or that would prevent any  Communications  License from
being  renewed on a routine  basis in the ordinary  course.  The  execution  and
delivery of this  Agreement  by Sellers does not,  and the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  and the  performance  by  Sellers  of  their
respective  obligations  hereunder,  assuming  the  receipt of the  Governmental
Required  Consents,  will not violate or conflict  with any term,  condition  or
provision  of  any  material  Communication  License,  will  not  result  in any
revocation,  cancellation,  suspension, or material modification of any material
Communications  License, or give rise to the right of any Governmental Authority
to take any such action or fail to renew any material Communications License.

     Except for the  representations  and  warranties  of Sellers  expressly set
forth in this  Section  3.13 or as  specifically  referred to  elsewhere in this
Agreement,  neither of Sellers nor any other Person  makes any other  express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Communications  Licenses, and
none of the other  representations  and  warranties  contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be given in relation to Communications Licenses.

     costs, administrative oversight costs and natural resource damages) arising
     out of, based on or related to Environmental Matters.

          (e) Except as would not result in any  material  cost to the  Company,

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

     Purchaser represents and warrants to Sellers as follows on the date of this
Agreement (and such  representations  and warranties shall be deemed made on the
Closing Date):

     4.1 Authority of  Purchaser.  Purchaser is a  corporation  duly  organized,
validly  existing  and in good  standing  under  the  laws of  Oregon,  with all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Purchaser has all requisite
corporate  power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations  under this  Agreement.  The execution,  delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Purchaser has been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate
action.  This  Agreement  has been duly and validly  executed  and  delivered by
Purchaser and constitutes the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of Purchaser
enforceable  against  Purchaser in accordance  with its terms,  except as may be
limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,  reorganization or
similar Laws from time to time in effect that affect creditors' rights generally
or (b) legal and equitable limitations on the availability of specific remedies.

     4.2  Consents  and  Approvals.  Assuming  the  receipt of the  Governmental
Required Consents of the Purchaser and consents in connection with its financing
of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  the execution and delivery
of  this  Agreement  by  Purchaser  does  not,  and  the   consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated hereby and performance by Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder will not,  violate or conflict with any provision of: (i) the charter,
operating agreement,  by-laws or analogous organizational document of Purchaser;
(ii) any material agreement,  lease, instrument,  mortgage, license or franchise
to which  Purchaser is a party or by which any of its  properties  is bound;  or
(iii) any Law  applicable  to Purchaser  and which  violation or conflict  would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Purchaser's  ability
to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby. Except for the Governmental
Required  Consents of Purchaser,  no  authorization,  consent or approval of, or
filing  with,  any  Governmental  Authority is required in  connection  with the
execution and delivery of, or performance by Purchaser of its obligations under,
this Agreement.

     4.3  Brokers,  Etc.  Except for FTI  Consultants,  the fees and expenses of
which shall be the  responsibility of Purchaser,  no broker or investment banker
acting on behalf of Purchaser is or will be entitled to any broker's or finder's
fee or any other  commission or similar fee directly or indirectly in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     4.4 Securities.  Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Purchased Interests
are not registered  under the Securities Act or registered or qualified for sale
under any applicable securities Law of the United States or any other country or
any state or  province of the United  States or any other  country and cannot be
resold  without  registration  thereunder or exemption  therefrom.  Purchaser is
acquiring  the  Purchased  Interests  for  its own  account  as  principal,  for
investment  purposes and has no present  intention  to dispose of the  Purchased
Interests, in whole or in part, or of any interest in the Purchased Interests to
any other Person  whether by public  distribution  or  otherwise.  Purchaser has
sufficient  knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to enable
it to evaluate the risks of investment  in the  Purchased  Interests and has the
ability to bear the economic risks of such investment.

     4.5  Financing.  Attached as Exhibit G are complete and accurate  copies of
the  commitment  letters (the  "Commitment  Letters")  executed by the financing
sources  thereto,  pursuant to which those  financing  sources  have  committed,
subject only to the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, to
provide the  financing to  consummate  the purchase of the Company in accordance
with this Agreement (the  "Financing").  Purchaser has the financial  ability to
consummate the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  subject only to
obtaining  the  Financing.  The  obligation  to fund  the  Financing  under  the
Commitment  Letters is not subject to any  condition  other than as set forth in
the Commitment Letters. The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect; all
commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid in full or will be
duly  paid in full if and when due;  and the  Commitment  Letters  have not been
amended or terminated.  Purchaser has no reason to believe that any condition to
the  Commitment  Letters  that is within its control  will not be  satisfied  or
waived prior to Closing. As of the Closing,  subject to receiving the Financing,
Purchaser will have received cash in an aggregate  amount  sufficient to pay all
amounts required to be paid by it in connection with the Closing,  including the
Purchase Price and all payments,  fees and expenses related to or arising out of
the acquisition of the Purchased Interests (the "Required Cash Amount").

     4.6  Solvency.   Immediately   after  giving  effect  to  the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained
by  Purchaser,  Purchaser  and its  subsidiaries  shall  be  able  to pay  their
respective  debts  as they  become  due and  shall  own  property  having a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts  required to pay their  respective debts
(including a reasonable  estimate of the amount of all contingent  liabilities).
Immediately  after  giving  effect  to the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement  and the closing of any financing to be obtained by Purchaser in order
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and
its  subsidiaries  shall  have  adequate  capital  to carry on their  respective
businesses.  No transfer of  property is being made and no  obligation  is being
incurred in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and
the closing of any  financing to be obtained by Purchaser in order to effect the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of Purchaser.

     indebtedness,  except: (i) Liabilities reflected or reserved against in, or
     set forth on, the Purchaser's  Financial  Statements;  and (ii) Liabilities
     that either (A) were incurred in the ordinary  course of business since the
     date of the Purchaser's Financial Statements,  (B) would not be required to

     4.8  Material  Adverse  Change.  Since  September  30,  2005  there has not
occurred any change in the  condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  or results of
operations of the Company that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material  Adverse Effect on Purchaser or its  subsidiaries (as if the definition
of Material Adverse Effect applied to Purchaser instead of the Company).

     4.9  Independent  Investigation.  In making the decision to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  other than
reliance  on the  representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  obligations  of
Sellers  set forth in this  Agreement,  Purchaser  has relied  solely on its own
independent  investigation,  analysis and  evaluation of the Company  (including
Purchaser's  own estimate and appraisal of the value of the Business,  financial
condition,  assets, operations and prospects of the Company). Purchaser confirms
to Sellers that Purchaser is sophisticated  and knowledgeable in the Business of
the Company and is capable of evaluating the matters set forth above.

     4.10 Legal Qualifications.  Purchaser is qualified under the Communications
Act of 1934,  as  amended,  and FCC  Rules,  to  control  the  Company.  Neither
Purchaser  nor any entity  holding 5% or more of the direct or  indirect  voting
equity in Purchaser  has been  determined by the FCC not to be qualified to hold
an FCC License or to control a holder of an FCC License,  and no  proceeding  in
which such qualifications are at issue is pending, or to Purchaser's  knowledge,
threatened,  before the FCC or on appeal of an FCC order.  Neither Purchaser nor
any  entity  holding  5% or more of the  direct  or  indirect  voting  equity in
Purchaser  has been  determined  by any State PUC not to be  qualified to hold a
State  PUC  License  or to  control  a holder  of a State  PUC  License,  and no
proceeding in which such qualifications are at issue is pending before any State
PUC or on appeal of a State PUC order.

     its  Affiliates   with  respect  to  the  Closing,   (ii)  to  obtain  each
     Governmental  Required Consent of such party and each other consent of, and
     make  necessary  filings  with,  a  Governmental  Authority,  which  if not
     obtained or made is reasonably  likely to have a material adverse effect on
     the ability of the parties to consummate the  transactions  contemplated by
     this  Agreement or result in a Material  Adverse  Effect and (iii) to cause
     the occurrence or meeting of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles

     persons  nominated  thereby,  will,  promptly  provide  drafts to the other

     waivers as a result of the transactions  contemplated hereby.  Parent shall
     use commercially  reasonable efforts to provide  cooperation and assistance

     of the  Company) and Parent shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to

               prepayment  for the use or service or similar term that  provides
               for customer payments in advance of the use or service;

          (o)  sell,  lease,  license  or  otherwise  grant a  right  to use any
               material dark fiber of the Company;

          (p)  prepay in any way any  capital  lease of the  Company,  including
               those listed on Schedule 1.1(a);

          (q)  institute any proceeding with respect to, or otherwise materially
               change,  amend, or supplement any of its tariffs on file with the
               FCC or any State PUC,  except in the ordinary course of business,
               or as required by Law;

          (r)  with respect to the Company or any Affiliated  Group of which the
               Company (as distinguished  from any of the Sellers) is the common
               parent,  (i)  make  any  Tax  election   inconsistent  with  past
               practice, (ii) change any Tax election already made, (iii) settle
               or compromise any federal,  state, local or foreign Tax liability
               or agree to an extension of a statute of  limitations,  (iv) fail
               to file any Income Tax Return or other  material  Tax Return when
               due (or, alternatively, fail to file for available extensions) or
               fail to cause such  Income  Tax  Returns  or other  material  Tax
               Returns  when filed to be complete and  accurate,  or (v) fail to
               pay any Income  Taxes or other  material  Taxes when due, in each
               case, in any manner materially adverse to the Company;  provided,
               however,  nothing set forth in this clause (r) shall prohibit the
               Company from changing,  electing,  settling or  compromising  Tax
               liabilities to the extent required by Law; or

          (s)  authorize  any of,  or commit to agree,  whether  in  writing  or
               otherwise, to do any of, the foregoing.

     5.4 Confidentiality.

          (a) Purchaser  acknowledges  that the information being provided to it
     in connection with the transactions  contemplated  hereby is subject to the
     terms  of  the  Confidentiality  Agreement;  provided  that  Purchaser  may
     disclose such information concerning the Company as is reasonably necessary
     to  obtain  the  Financing,  including  through  the use of a  confidential
     private placement  memorandum or offering circular.  In no way limiting the
     generality of the  foregoing,  the terms of the  Confidentiality  Agreement
     shall not prevent the Company from using,  after Closing,  the confidential
     and proprietary information governed by the Confidentiality  Agreement that
     relates primarily to the Company; provided that Purchaser acknowledges that
     any and all other  information  provided  to it by  Sellers or any of their
     Affiliates or representatives concerning Sellers or any of their Affiliates
     (other than with respect to the Company)  shall remain subject to the terms
     and conditions of the  Confidentiality  Agreement and the Company shall, to
     the same extent as Purchaser, be subject to all confidentiality  provisions
     of the Confidentiality Agreement as though it were a party thereto.


                                       36
<PAGE>

          (b) At all times from and after the Closing  Date,  Sellers shall keep
     secret and maintain in  confidence,  and shall not use for their benefit or
     for the benefit of others,  any  confidential  or  proprietary  information
     relating  to the  Business or the  Company's  financial  or other  affairs,
     including all of the Company's  Intellectual Property and files and records
     (other than the Retained  Assets),  other than any of such information that
     is in the public domain  (unless and to the extent any of such  information
     enters the public  domain in whole or in part due to action or  inaction of
     Sellers  following  the Closing).  The foregoing  shall not prohibit use or
     disclosure  of such  information  (i) as is  required  by  Law,  (ii) as is
     necessary  to prepare Tax Returns  (including  Tax Returns of Sellers or of
     any of their Affiliates) or other filings with Governmental  Authorities or
     to defend or object to any reassessment of Taxes, (iii) as is necessary for
     Sellers  (or their  representatives)  to prepare  and  disclose,  as may be
     required,  accounting  or other  financial  statements or (iv) to assert or
     protect  any rights of Sellers  hereunder  or under any  applicable  Law or
     otherwise.

          (c) Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that in the event of a
     breach  of this  Section  5.4 by  either  party  or of the  Confidentiality
     Agreement by Purchaser,  the other party would suffer  irreparable harm for
     which it would be  difficult  to  determine  damages  and for  which  money
     damages  alone would be an inadequate  remedy for the injuries  suffered by
     such party,  and that such party shall be entitled to specific  performance
     and injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce this Section 5.4 and/or
     the Confidentiality  Agreement,  without any requirement to submit proof of
     the economic value of any confidential or proprietary information or post a
     bond or any  other  security.  Such  remedy  shall  not be deemed to be the
     exclusive  remedy for breach of this Section 5.4 or of the  Confidentiality
     Agreement but shall be in addition to all other  remedies  available at Law
     or equity.

     5.5 Employee Matters.

          (a) From and after the Closing Date,  Purchaser  shall, or shall cause
     the Company to, provide Company Employees  retained by the Purchaser or the
     Company  following  the  Closing  (each a  "Retained  Employee")  with  all
     employee  benefit  plans  (other  than  equity  compensation  plans) as are
     provided by Purchaser and its  subsidiaries  to their own employees who are
     similarly  situated  to such  Company  Employees  (the  "New  Plans").  The
     foregoing  shall not constitute any  commitment,  contract,  understanding,
     undertaking,  guarantee  (express or implied) on the part of  Purchaser  or
     Company to continue the  employment of any Company  Employee for any period
     of time or on any terms except as determined by Purchaser.

          (b) For  purposes of each New Plan that may provide  medical,  dental,
     pharmaceutical,  life,  disability  and/or vision  benefits to any Retained
     Employee,  Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
     relevant   insurer(s)  (i)  to  waive  all  eligibility   waiting  periods,
     pre-existing  condition  exclusions and  actively-at-work  requirements for
     such Retained  Employee and his or her covered  dependents and (ii) to take
     into account any eligible  expenses incurred by a Retained Employee and his
     or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Parent
     Plan  or  Company   Benefit  Plan  (ending  on  the  date  the   employee's
     participation  in the  corresponding  New  Plan  begins)  for  purposes  of
     satisfying   any   deductible,   coinsurance   and  maximum   out-of-pocket
     requirements  applicable  to the  Retained  Employee and his or her covered
     dependents  for the  applicable  plan year.  For all  purposes  (other than
     benefit  accrual under a defined  benefit pension plan) under the New Plans
     (including any Purchaser  severance plans) each Retained  Employee shall be
     credited  with his or her years of  service  with the  Company  to the same
     extent such  Retained  Employee  was  entitled to  eligibility,  vesting or
     benefit accrual credit,  as applicable,  for such service under any similar
     Parent  Plan or  Company  Benefit  Plan in  which  such  Retained  Employee
     participated immediately prior to the Closing.

          (c) Immediately prior to the Closing,  Parent shall cause each Company
     Employee to become  fully  vested in his or her accrued  benefit  under the
     Seller  Savings  Plan or other Parent Plan that is intended to be qualified
     under Section 401(a) of the Code.  After the Closing,  Purchaser and Seller
     shall cooperate to ensure that Retained Employees are permitted to rollover
     their account  balances  under the Seller Savings Plan,  including  in-kind
     rollovers of  participant  loans into  Purchaser's  401(k) plan;  provided,
     however,  that Purchaser shall not be required to permit any such rollovers
     by  Retained  Employees  if it  determines  that  any such  rollover  could
     jeopardize the tax-qualified status of Purchaser's 401(k) plan.


                                       37
<PAGE>

          (d) Prior to the Closing,  Sellers or the Company, as the case may be,
     shall pay in full all obligations owed under the 2005 Annual Incentive Plan
     Design (which shall not continue into 2006 unless Parent assumes all of the
     liabilities  under such plans or accrues  such  liabilities  on the Closing
     Balance  Sheet  and such  plans do not give  rise to any  liability  of the
     Company or Purchaser (excluding accrued amounts) following the Closing) and
     any other similar plan.

          (e)  Purchaser  shall provide  severance  benefits and payments to any
     Company Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser (i) within the
     first  six (6)  months  following  the  Closing,  in  accordance  with  the
     Company's  severance  programs  in  effect  immediately  prior to  Closing;
     provided that, such severance  program only provides for severance based on
     base salary and not any other pay or compensation  (except to the extent of
     subsidized COBRA payments as provided in the Company's  severance  programs
     in effect  immediately  prior to Closing),  and (ii) following such six (6)
     month  period,   in  accordance   with   Purchaser's   severance   programs
     ("Purchaser's Severance Arrangements"),  taking into account, to the extent
     relevant,  such Company Employee's  combined service with Seller and/or its
     Affiliates  prior to the  Closing  Date and  Purchaser  from and  after the
     Closing Date. A summary of Purchaser's Severance  Arrangements is set forth
     on Exhibit H.

          (f) Purchaser  shall  provide each Retained  Employee with any accrued
     and unused  days of paid time off that he or she is  eligible to take as of
     the Closing Date in accordance  with the applicable paid time off policy of
     the Company.  Notwithstanding  Section 5.5(a),  Purchaser in its discretion
     may maintain Retained  Employees on the paid time off policy of the Company
     until December 31, 2006.

          (g) (i)  Purchaser  shall  have in  effect  as of the  Closing  Date a
     flexible spending account plan qualified under Section 125 of the Code (the
     "Purchaser   Flexible  Spending  Plan"),  and  Purchaser  shall  cause  the
     Purchaser  Flexible  Spending  Plan to accept a spin-off  of the assets and
     liabilities  related to the Retained  Employees' flexible spending accounts
     ("FSAs")  from the flexible  spending  plan of Seller in which the Retained
     Employees  participate  immediately  prior  to  the  Closing  (the  "Seller
     Flexible  Spending Plan") and to honor and continue  through the end of the
     calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the  elections  made by each
     Retained Employee under the Seller Flexible Spending Plan in respect of the
     FSAs that are in effect  immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) as
     soon as practicable  following the Closing Date,  Seller shall (a) cause to
     be  transferred  from the Seller  Flexible  Spending  Plan to the Purchaser
     Flexible   Spending   Plan  the   excess  of  the   aggregate   accumulated
     contributions to the FSAs made prior to the Closing Date during the year in
     which the  Closing  Date occurs by Retained  Employees  over the  aggregate
     reimbursement  payouts  made prior to the  Closing  Date for such year from
     such accounts to the Retained  Employee,  and (b) provide Purchaser with an
     itemized schedule of each Retained  Employee's election amount and benefits
     paid prior to the Closing  Date  during the year in which the Closing  Date
     occurs. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from such FSAs made prior to
     the Closing  Date  during the year in which the Closing  Date occurs to the
     Retained Employees exceed the aggregate  accumulated  contributions to such
     accounts prior to the Closing Date for such year by the Retained Employees,
     Purchaser  shall make a payment equal to the value of such excess to Seller
     as soon as practicable following the Closing Date. Seller Flexible Spending
     Plan  shall  be   responsible   for  any  covered   claims   submitted  for
     reimbursement  before the Closing Date. Except as provided in the preceding
     sentence,  on and after the Closing  Date,  Purchaser  shall  assume and be
     solely  responsible  for all unpaid claims by Retained  Employees under the
     Seller Flexible Spending Plan incurred at any time during the calendar year
     in which the Closing Date occurs,  including  claims  incurred prior to the
     Closing Date,  that have not been  submitted  before the Closing Date,  and
     following the Closing Date,  Purchaser shall hold Seller and its affiliates
     harmless from any and all claims for  reimbursement  by Retained  Employees
     under the Seller  Flexible  Spending  Plan  incurred at any time during the
     calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs but which were not submitted
     to the Seller Flexible  Spending Plan before the Closing Date. For purposes
     of this paragraph,  a claim for reimbursement  shall be deemed to have been
     incurred  on the date on which the  charge or expense  giving  rise to such
     claim is incurred.

     5.6 Records; Post-Closing Access to Information.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
     Agreement,  Sellers  may retain  all (i)  original  agreements,  documents,
     books,  records and files  prepared  in  connection  with the  transactions
     contemplated  hereby,  including  bids  received  from  other  parties  and
     analyses relating to the Company and (ii) Tax Returns.

          (b) Subject to Section 10.2(a),  for a period of seven years after the
     Closing  Date,  Purchaser  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to
     preserve  and  retain,  or cause the Company to  preserve  and retain,  all
     material  agreements,  documents,  books,  records and files (including any
     documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental  actions, suits,
     proceedings or investigations)  relating to the conduct of the Business and
     operations  of  the  Company  prior  to  the  Closing  Date  (collectively,
     "Records").  Subject to Section 10.2(a),  for a period of seven years after
     the Closing Date,  Sellers  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
     preserve and retain all Records,  including all financial records, policies
     and  procedures  customarily  required for the completion of an audit by an
     independent accounting firm, in its and its Affiliates possession following
     the Closing, and shall provide Purchaser and the Company access to all such
     records at reasonable times upon reasonable notice.

          (c)  Subject  to Section  10.2(a),  from and after the  Closing  Date,
     Purchaser  shall  cause the Company to afford  Sellers  and their  counsel,
     accountants and other  authorized  representatives,  upon reasonable  prior
     notice,  reasonable  access during normal  business hours to the respective
     premises,  properties,  personnel, books and records of the Company and any
     other  assets  or  information  that  Sellers  reasonably  deem  necessary,
     including in connection  with the  preparation  of any report or Tax Return
     required to be filed by Sellers under  applicable  Law or otherwise (but so
     as not to unduly  disrupt the normal  course of operations of the Company),
     including  preparing or defending  any Tax Return and any interim or annual
     report or other  accounting  statements.  Personnel  of  Purchaser  and the
     Company shall assist Sellers in the preparation of Tax Returns  relating to
     the Pre-Closing Tax Periods in accordance with Article 10.

     5.7 Continued  Operations.  Purchaser shall be responsible for any costs in
connection with its termination of any Company Employee's employment on or after
the  Closing  Date,  and  Purchaser  shall  assume  and be  responsible  for any
liability arising under the Worker  Adjustment and Retraining  Notification Act,
and/or any other  plant or mass  layoff  closing  Law,  in  connection  with its
termination of any Company Employee's employment on or after the Closing Date.

     5.8  Communications  Licenses.  Prior to the  Closing,  the  Company  shall
maintain the validity of the Communications  Licenses and Franchise  Agreements,
including those set forth on Schedule 6.5, comply in all material  respects with
all requirements of the Communications  Licenses,  Franchise  Agreements and the
Communications  Act and any applicable  state or local Laws,  including those of
State PUCs. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially  reasonable
efforts to (a) refrain from taking any action that would jeopardize the validity
of any of the  Communications  Licenses,  (b)  prosecute  with due diligence any
pending applications with respect to the Communications Licenses,  including any
renewals  thereof  and  applications  seeking  FCC  Consents  and the  State PUC
Consents as set forth on  Schedule  6.5 and (c) with  respect to  Communications
Licenses,  file all  registrations,  reports,  renewal  applications,  and other
documents and pay all required fees and  contributions,  in each case,  that are
required  by the  Communications  Act or any  applicable  state or  local  Laws,
including  those of State PUCs as and when such filings or reports are necessary
or appropriate.

     5.9 Notice of Developments.

          (a) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of all
     events, circumstances, facts and occurrences arising subsequent to the date
     of  this  Agreement  that  could  result  in  any  material   breach  of  a
     representation  or warranty by or covenant of such party in this  Agreement
     or that could have the effect of making any  representation  or warranty by
     such party in this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

          (b) Each party shall,  in each case as soon as possible  upon becoming
     aware,  from time to time prior to the Closing Date,  supplement in writing
     the  Schedules  hereto  with  respect to any event,  circumstance,  fact or
     occurrence  hereafter  arising  that,  if  existing  as of the date of this
     Agreement,  would have been  required to be set forth or  described  in the
     Schedules; provided, however, that (i) except as and to the extent provided
     in this Section 5.9(b), none of such disclosures shall be deemed to modify,
     amend or supplement the representations and warranties by such party or the
     Schedules for the purposes of this Agreement,  unless the other party shall
     have  consented  thereto  in  writing  and (ii)  upon  consummation  of the
     Closing,  regardless  of any other  provisions  of this Section  5.9,  such
     disclosures  shall  automatically be deemed to modify the Schedules for all
     purposes,  including for purposes of Article 9 hereof.  The party receiving
     such supplemented Schedules must notify the party that has supplemented the
     Schedules  within  twenty-one  (21) days of  receipt  of such  supplemented
     Schedules whether the supplemental  information  disclosed  therein,  taken
     together with all other supplemental  information provided pursuant to this
     Section  5.9(b),  constitutes  facts  or  circumstances  giving  rise  to a
     Material  Adverse  Effect or  otherwise  giving  rise to a  failure  of the
     condition  set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 7.1 hereto,  as the case may
     be. If no such notice is given  within such  twenty-one  (21)  Business Day
     period, then such disclosure shall be deemed to modify, amend or supplement
     the  representations  and warranties by such party and the Schedules and to
     have  cured  any  misrepresentation  or  breach  of any  representation  or
     warranty  that  might  have  existed  by  reason  of the  development.  The
     supplementing  party agrees to cooperate in good faith in timely  providing
     complete and correct  documents or other information  reasonably  necessary
     for the receiving party to have a basis for determining  whether to deliver
     the notice referred to above.

          (c) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, subject to
     applicable Laws and the  instructions of any  Governmental  Authority,  the
     parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to
     completion of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  including  promptly
     furnishing  the  other  with  copies  of  notices  or other  communications
     received by such party from any Governmental Authority or other Person with
     respect to the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  Each party
     shall  give  prompt  notice  to the other  parties  of any  failure  of any
     condition  to  such  party's   obligations   to  effect  the   transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement.

          (d)   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   with  respect  to  Schedules
     3.19(a)(1)  and  3.24,  Parent  shall  provide  Purchaser  with  up to date
     schedules  of circuits  leased by the Company in effect as of a date within
     three (3)  Business  Days of the  Closing  Date that shall be prepared in a
     manner  consistent with Schedules  3.19(a) and 3.24 attached  hereto.  Such
     updated schedules shall indicate, among other things, those circuits leased
     by the Company to be retained by Parent as Retained Assets (that shall have
     the effect of amending  Exhibit A hereto),  which leased  circuits shall be
     the responsibility of Parent following the Closing Date. The circuits noted
     on Attachment 3.19(a) to Schedule 3.19(a)(1) shall identify (1) circuits to
     be retained by Parent as circuits  that are used in or for the operation of
     the Parent's business as opposed to the operation of the Company's business
     and (2) circuits not to be retained by Parent as circuits  that are used in
     or for the operation of the Company's  business as opposed to the operation
     of the  Parent's  business in the same manner as  currently  identified  on
     Attachment  3.19(a).  Purchaser  shall have the  opportunity  to review the
     updated  schedules  provided  pursuant to this clause (d) and consult  with
     Parent regarding thereto. Such updated schedules shall be deemed to modify,
     amend and  supplement  Schedules  3.19(a) and 3.24 and Exhibit A hereto and
     the corresponding  representations  and warranties for all purposes of this
     Agreement.

     5.10 Cooperation in Litigation.

          (a) Each  party  hereto  will  fully  cooperate  with the other in the
     defense or prosecution of any litigation or proceeding  already  instituted
     or which may be instituted  hereafter  against or by such party relating to
     or arising out of the  conduct of the  Business  prior to the Closing  Date
     (other than litigation arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement).  Subject to the indemnity  obligations  set forth in Article 9,
     the party requesting such cooperation shall pay the out-of-pocket  expenses
     (including  legal  fees and  disbursements)  of the  party  providing  such
     cooperation and of its officers, directors,  managers, employees and agents
     reasonably  incurred in connection  with  providing such  cooperation,  but
     shall not be responsible to reimburse the party providing such  cooperation
     for such party's time spent in such cooperation or the salaries or costs of
     fringe  benefits  or  similar  expenses  paid by the party  providing  such
     cooperation  to its  officers,  managers,  directors,  employees and agents
     while  assisting in the defense or  prosecution  of any such  litigation or
     proceeding.  The Company has maintained,  and, to the extent required to do
     so, will continue to escrow and maintain, a cash escrow with respect to the
     Portland  Franchise  Dispute that is  sufficient to pay in full all amounts
     (other than statutory  interest thereon) that may be required to be paid in
     respect of such matter,  and, subject to Section  5.10(b),  will reserve an
     amount  on  the  Closing  Balance  Sheet  necessary  to pay  any  statutory
     interest.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  Section  5.10(a)  above,  the Company  shall not
     settle the Portland  Franchise  Dispute prior to Closing  without the prior
     written  consent of  Purchaser.  If Parent seeks  Purchaser's  consent to a
     written,  definitive  settlement proposal acceptable to Parent and the City
     of Portland (the "Settlement Proposal") and Purchaser refuses to consent to
     such Settlement Proposal,  then for purposes of determining Working Capital
     as of the Closing Date,  the parties agree that the Company's  accrual with
     respect to the  Portland  Franchise  Dispute  shall be reduced by an amount
     equal to the difference (if a positive  number) between (x) the amount that
     the Company has accrued for the interest related to the Portland  Franchise
     Dispute  through  the date  Parent  presents  the  Settlement  Proposal  to
     Purchaser  in writing and (y) the amount the Company  and/or  Parent  would
     have to pay to the City of Portland in interest  pursuant to the Settlement
     Proposal.   In  addition,   under  such  circumstances,   for  purposes  of
     determining  Working Capital as of the Closing Date, the parties agree that
     the  Company  shall not be  obligated  to accrue any  additional  statutory
     interest  with respect to the  Portland  Franchise  Dispute  after the date
     Parent presents the Settlement Proposal to Purchaser in writing through the
     Closing Date.

     5.11 Transfer of Retained Assets. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer the Retained Assets to an entity  designated by Parent prior
to the Closing.  Sellers shall be responsible  for any costs,  and shall provide
for  the  assumption  of any  liabilities,  associated  with  the  transfer  and
retention of, and otherwise in connection with, the Retained Assets.

     5.12 Reasonable Best Efforts to Obtain  Financing.  Purchaser shall use its
reasonable  best efforts to complete the Financing  and satisfy its  obligations
under the Commitment Letters in accordance with and by the date specified in the
terms and  conditions of the  Commitment  Letters.  Purchaser  shall keep Parent
reasonably  informed  of  all  material  developments,  positive  and  negative,
concerning  the status of the  Financing  described in the  Commitment  Letters.
Without limiting the foregoing,  Purchaser agrees to notify Parent promptly, and
in any event within two (2) Business  Days,  if at any time prior to the Closing
(i) any  Commitment  Letter shall have expired or be terminated  for any reason,
(ii) any  financing  source that is a party to any  Commitment  Letter  notifies
Purchaser that such source no longer  intends to provide  financing to Purchaser
on the terms set forth therein,  or (iii)  Purchaser no longer  believes in good

                                       41

faith, subject to receipt of said Financing,  that it will be able to obtain the
Required Cash Amount.  Purchaser  shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or
alter, any Commitment  Letter in any manner that could reasonably be expected to
impair,  delay or  prevent  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,
without the prior written consent of Parent.  If any Commitment  Letter shall be
terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Purchaser's  ability to
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  for any reason,
Purchaser shall use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain  alternative
financing as promptly as practical in any amount that,  together  with  existing
cash resources, will equal the Required Cash Amount. If obtained, Purchaser will
provide Parent with a copy of the new financing commitment letters.

     5.13  Exclusivity.  Sellers  agree that until this  Agreement is terminated
under the terms hereof or until the Closing (the "Exclusivity Period"),  Sellers
shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of its  respective  officers,
directors, managers, agents or Affiliates to: (A) enter into any written or oral
agreement or understanding with any Person (other than Purchaser)  regarding the
sale (whether by sale of membership interests,  merger,  consolidation,  sale of
assets (other than the Retained Assets) or other disposition) of all or any part
of the Company or any  material  portion of its assets or  membership  interests
("Another  Transaction");  (B)  enter  into  or  continue  any  negotiations  or
discussion with any Person (other than  Purchaser)  regarding the possibility of
Another  Transaction;  or (C) except as  otherwise  required by Law,  order of a
Governmental Authority or similar compulsion, provide any nonpublic financial or
other confidential or proprietary  information  regarding the Company (including
this  Agreement,  any materials  containing  Purchaser's  proposal and any other
financial  information,  projections or proposals  regarding the Company) to any
Person (other than Purchaser and its representatives).

     5.14 Audit.

          (a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG LLP
     or  such  other  accounting  firm  of  international  recognition  mutually
     acceptable to Parent and Purchaser (the  "Auditors") to audit (the "Audit")
     as promptly as practicable  following the date hereof (i) the  consolidated
     statements  of earnings,  cash flows and owners'  equity of the Company and
     the  Subsidiary for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004
     and (ii) the consolidated  balance sheets of the Company and the Subsidiary
     as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

          (b) To the extent the financial statements to be audited in accordance
     with clause (a) above include the Retained Assets and the results  relating
     thereto,  Parent  shall  prepare  and deliver to  Purchaser  as promptly as
     practicable  following  completion  of  the  Audit,   unaudited  pro  forma
     financial  statements  of the Company  and the  Subsidiary  reflecting  the
     impact of the exclusion of all of the Retained Assets as if their carve-out
     had occurred on January 1, 2005.

          (c) Upon  completion of the Audit,  Parent shall cause the Auditors to
     deliver to Parent an audit report stating (without  qualification)  that in
     its opinion the financial  statements  described in Section  5.14(a)(i) and
     (ii)  (including  the notes thereto) (the "Audited  Financial  Statements")
     have been  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP and present  fairly,  in all
     material respects, the financial position of the Company and the Subsidiary
     on December 31, 2005 and  December  31, 2004 and the results of  operations
     for the periods  covered  thereby.  Immediately  following  receipt of such
     report,  Parent  shall  deliver to  Purchaser  such  report and the Audited
     Financial Statements. In the event the Auditors refuse, decline or indicate
     that they are  unwilling  to deliver  the audit  report  referred to above,
     Parent  shall  promptly  notify  Purchaser  of that fact and the  events or
     circumstances  giving rise  thereto.  Purchaser  and Parent  shall each pay
     one-half the cost of the Audit.

other  procedures,  in each  case,  as may be  recommended  by an  environmental

     indirectly,  engage or participate in, acquire, manage, operate, control or
     participate in the  management,  operation or control of, or own or possess
     an interest  in,  either  alone or jointly,  any Person that engages in the

     markets in which the Company  operates  on the date hereof (the  "Purchased
     Business  Markets")  for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing
     Date; provided,  however, that Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
     Company)  shall not be  restricted  from engaging or  participating  in any
     business  or  activity   in  which  such   entity   currently   engages  or
     participates.  If the final  judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction
     declares  that any term or  provision  of this  Section  5.19 is invalid or
     unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
     invalidity  or  unenforceability  shall have the power to reduce the scope,
     duration,  or area of the term or provision,  to delete  specific  words or
     phrases,  or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
     a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
     the intention of the invalid or unenforceable  term or provision,  and this
     Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after  expiration of the time
     within which the judgment may be appealed.

          (b) Sellers  covenant  and agree that they shall not (and shall assure
     that none of their Affiliates),  directly or indirectly,  for a period from
     the date hereof until  eighteen  (18) months after the Closing Date solicit
     to hire or hire, any employee of the Business  employed by Purchaser or any
     of Purchaser's  Affiliates after the Closing Date or any employee currently
     employed by Purchaser or  Purchaser's  Affiliates  as of the date hereof or
     employed by  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Affiliates  on the  Closing  Date;
     provided,  however,  that the  foregoing  shall not  prohibit (i) a general
     solicitation to the public of general advertising or (ii) a solicitation of
     any  employee  that  has  been   terminated  by  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's
     Affiliates and provided  further that nothing in this Section 5.19(b) shall
     prohibit  the  Sellers or any of Sellers'  Affiliates  from  employing  any
     person  who  contacts  them  on his or her  own  initiative  (including  in
     response  to a general  solicitation)  and  without  any direct or indirect
     solicitation  or  encouragement  or  inducement  by the  Sellers  or any of
     Sellers' Affiliates.

          (c) Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall not (and shall assure
     that none of its Affiliates), directly or indirectly, for a period from the

     hire or hire,  any  employee  of  Sellers  or any of  Sellers'  Affiliates;
     provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) Purchaser from
     hiring any of the Company Employees;  or (ii) a general solicitation to the
     public of general  advertising;  and provided  further that nothing in this
     Section shall prohibit Purchaser and Purchaser's  Affiliates from employing
     any person who contacts  them on his or her own  initiative  (including  in
     response  to a general  solicitation)  and  without  any direct or indirect
     solicitation by Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliates.

     5.20 Cooperation in Transition.

          (a) The parties to this Agreement agree that Parent and Purchaser will
     need  to  work  together  prior  to  Closing  to  prepare  for  appropriate
     transition of operations and support provided by Parent to the Company.  In
     furtherance  thereof and until the effectiveness of the Transition Services
     Agreement,  Parent  shall,  and shall  cause  the  Company  to,  reasonably
     cooperate  with  Purchaser  and  assist and  facilitate  the  analysis  and
     preparation  for  the  conversion  of the  systems  data,  information  and
     functionality   from  Parent's   operating   systems  and  applications  to
     Purchaser's operating systems and applications ("Interim Conversion Work").
     In  addition,  Parent  shall,  and shall cause the  Company to,  reasonably
     cooperate  with  Purchaser,   and  assist  and  facilitate  Purchaser,   in
     developing the collection and remittance capabilities currently provided to
     the Company by Parent.  Parent shall designate a Project Manager(s) for the
     purpose  of  working  with   Purchaser  to  provide  the  necessary   data,
     information  and functions as reasonably  requested by Purchaser to perform
     the Interim  Conversion Work. The Project Manager(s) shall meet weekly with
     a representative of Purchaser or on a mutually agreed upon schedule.

          (b)  Parent  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause the
     vendors of the  software  that are listed on Schedule  5.20(b),  during the
     twenty-one (21) day period  immediately  following the date hereof to agree
     to enter into separate  software licenses with the Company on substantially
     the same terms as apply to the Company  currently  pursuant to the licenses
     with such  vendors  now in effect  with the  Parent,  except to the  extent
     Parent  and  Purchaser  determine  to enter  into the  Transition  Services
     Agreement attached as Exhibit B-2 to this Agreement. Such separate licenses
     will be fully paid  through the  periods  indicated  on  Schedule  5.20(b).
     Purchaser will be responsible for any future  payments  relating to periods
     after the Closing (including  maintenance  obligations) under such separate
     licenses, and Parent will be responsible for any fees or charges associated
     with such vendors agreeing to enter into separate  licenses for the benefit
     of the  Company.  If Parent is able to cause each of such  vendors to enter
     into such a separate  license on such terms as  outlined  above,  then,  if
     Purchaser and Parent shall agree, Parent and Purchaser shall enter into the
     Transition Services Agreement attached as Exhibit B-1 to this Agreement. If
     (i)  Parent is unable to cause  each of such  vendors  to enter into such a
     separate  license on such terms as outlined above and/or (ii) Purchaser and
     Parent  do not  agree  to  enter  into the  Transition  Services  Agreement
     attached as Exhibit B-1 to this Agreement, in either case within twenty-one
     (21) days following the date hereof,  or if Parent otherwise  elects,  then
     Parent and Purchaser  shall enter into the  Transition  Services  Agreement
     attached as Exhibit B-2 to this Agreement.

          (c) If,  pursuant to Section  5.20(b),  Parent and Purchaser  agree to
     enter into the Transition  Services Agreement attached as Exhibit B-1, then
     Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, effective at Closing, offer
     employment to  approximately  15 of Parent's IT personnel who are listed on
     Schedule  5.20(c)  and who are  qualified  to  support  the  Company's  OSS
     applications.  Parent  shall,  and shall cause the  Company to,  reasonably
     cooperate with Purchaser in providing Purchaser information with respect to
     such  personnel's  capabilities in order to assist Purchaser in determining
     which  of  such   personnel   are  suited  to  support  the  Company's  OSS
     applications following the Closing.

     5.21 No Additional Representations. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) neither
of the Sellers nor any other  Person has made any  representation  or  warranty,
expressed  or implied,  as to the Company or the  Business,  or the  accuracy or
completeness of any information  regarding the Company or the Business furnished
or made available to Purchaser and its representatives,  except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any  representation
or warranty from Sellers or any other Person in  determining  to enter into this
Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

     5.22 Long Distance Services. Parent and Purchaser shall seek agreement with
the  Company's  existing  LD  carriers to augment  those  carrier's  services to
accommodate the additional  capacity and/or services currently being provided to
the  Company  by  Parent's  LD  carriers  by the 60th day after the date of this
Agreement. If an agreement is timely reached with the LD carriers,  Parent shall
provide the facilities,  equipment,  manpower and services  necessary to augment
the Company's LD switches to accommodate  uninterrupted  LD services at Closing.
If Parent and Purchaser fail to reach  agreement with the Company's  existing LD
carriers by the 60th day after the date of this  Agreement,  Parent shall timely
provide the facilities,  equipment,  manpower and services  necessary to augment
the Company's LD switches to  accommodate  uninterrupted  LD services at Closing
using Purchaser's LD carriers. In each case, Parent shall not charge any mark-up
or fee or seek reimbursement for any costs except  pass-through  charges from LD
carriers.

     Regulations Section 1.445-2(a)(2) duly executed by Parent;

          (f) opinions of regulatory  counsel  dated the Closing Date  regarding
     telecommunications  regulatory matters, in form and substance, set forth on
     Exhibit J hereto; and

          (g) any other items  required  to be  delivered  by Sellers  under the
     terms and provisions of this Agreement.

     8.3  Deliveries of Purchaser.  At the Closing,  Purchaser  shall deliver to
Sellers:

          (a) confirmations of the wire transfers of immediately available funds
     required by Section 2.2;

          (b) the Transaction Documents, duly executed by Purchaser

          (c) the certificate pursuant to Section 7.7; and

          (d) any other items to be delivered  by Purchaser  under the terms and
     provisions of this Agreement.

     8.4 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate prior to Closing:

          (a) upon the mutual written agreement of Sellers and Purchaser;

          (b)  by  either  Purchaser  or  Sellers,   if  a  court  of  competent
     jurisdiction   or  other   Governmental   Authority  shall  have  issued  a
     nonappealable  final order,  decree or ruling or taken any other action, in
     each case  having  the  effect of  permanently  restraining,  enjoining  or
     otherwise  prohibiting the transactions  contemplated hereby, except if the
     party  relying  on such  order,  decree or ruling or other  action  has not
     complied with its obligations under this Agreement;

          (c) by either  Purchaser  or Sellers,  if the  Closing  shall not have
     occurred by September  30, 2006,  as such date may be extended from time to
     time to the extent the termination date in the Commitment  Letters has been
     extended in writing prior to September 30, 2006, such  termination  date to
     be no later than December 31, 2006;  provided,  however,  that the right to
     terminate this  Agreement  under this Section 8.4(c) shall not be available
     to any party whose failure to fulfill any  obligation  under this Agreement
     has been the cause of, or  resulted in the failure of, the Closing to occur
     on or before such date;

          (d) by  Sellers,  if there  has been a breach  of any  representation,
     warranty or covenant or  agreement  on the part of  Purchaser  set forth in
     this Agreement, which breach (i) causes the conditions set forth in Article
     7 not to be  satisfied  and (ii) shall not have been cured  within ten (10)
     Business  Days  following  receipt by Purchaser  of written  notice of such
     breach from Sellers;


                                       48
<PAGE>

          (e) by  Purchaser,  if there has been a breach of any  representation,
     warranty or covenant or  agreement on the part of Sellers set forth in this
     Agreement,  which breach (i) causes the  conditions  set forth in Article 6
     not to be  satisfied  and (ii)  shall not have been  cured  within ten (10)
     Business Days following receipt by Sellers of written notice of such breach
     from Purchaser; or

          (f) by Sellers,  if Purchaser has  delivered a notice  pursuant to the
     third  sentence  of  Section  5.12 and (i) has not  delivered  to Sellers a
     proposal letter with respect to alternative financing reasonably acceptable
     to Sellers  within  thirty  (30) days of  delivery  of the notice  provided
     pursuant  to the third  sentence  of  Section  5.12,  or (ii) if  Purchaser
     delivers such a proposal  letter(s) within such thirty day period,  has not
     delivered  to  Sellers  commitment  letters  with  respect  to  alternative
     financing  reasonably  acceptable to Sellers within thirty (30) days of the
     delivery of such proposal letter(s).

     If this  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to this Section 8.4, all further
obligations of the parties under this  Agreement  shall become null and void and
of no further force or effect,  except that (i) Sections  2.6,  5.4, 8.4,  11.1,
11.7,  and 11.13 will  survive,  and (ii) if this  Agreement is  terminated by a
party  because of the breach of the  Agreement by the other party or because one
or more of the  conditions to the  terminating  party's  obligations  under this
Agreement is not  satisfied as a result of the other  party's  failure to comply
with its  obligations  under this Agreement,  the  terminating  party's right to
pursue all legal remedies shall survive such termination unimpaired.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.4(c),  8.4(d) or 8.4(f) based on the failure of the closing  condition
set forth in Section 6.9  (Financing) to occur,  Purchaser shall pay Parent as a
termination  fee, in addition to the deposit  referred to in Section  2.6,  $3.5
million,  such  payment  to be made to Parent on the  later of (i)  twenty  (20)
Business Days after  termination  and (ii)  December 31, 2006.  For avoidance of
doubt, the retention of the deposit and the amounts set forth in this paragraph,
as well as the rights  granted to Parent in the Letter  Agreement and the rights
granted to Parent as provided  herein,  shall be the  exclusive  remedy  against
Purchaser based on a failure to obtain financing.

     8.5 Further Assurances.  Each party agrees that it shall, from time to time
after the date of this  Agreement,  execute and deliver such other documents and
instruments  and take such other actions as may be  reasonably  requested by any
other party to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 9.
                          SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

     9.1 Survival.

          (a)  The   representations,   warranties,   covenants  and  agreements
     contained  in  this  Agreement  shall  survive  the   consummation  of  the
     transactions  contemplated  hereby solely for purposes of this Article 9 as
     follows: (i) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
     (other than the representations  and warranties  contained in Sections 3.1,
     3.2,  3.3,  3.9,  3.11 and 4.1) shall  survive  for  eighteen  (18)  months
     following the Closing; (ii) any representations and warranties contained in
     Sections  3.1,  3.2,  3.3 and 4.1  shall  survive  indefinitely;  (iii) any
     representations  and  warranties  contained  in Sections 3.9 and 3.11 shall
     survive  the  Closing  for  the  duration  of  the  applicable  statute  of
     limitations  plus sixty (60) days;  (iv) any  covenants  contained  in this
     Agreement  shall  survive the Closing in accordance  with their  respective
     terms;  and (v)  all  other  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall  survive
     indefinitely.


                                       49
<PAGE>

          (b) Any right to  indemnification or other recovery under this Article
     9 shall only apply to Damages (as defined  below) with respect to which the
     Indemnified  Party shall have  notified the  Indemnifying  Party within the
     applicable  time  period set forth in this  Section  9.1.  If any claim for
     indemnification  or other recovery is timely asserted under this Article 9,
     the  Indemnified  Party  shall have the right to bring an  action,  suit or
     proceeding  with  respect to such claim  within one year after first giving
     the Indemnifying  Party notice thereof,  but may not bring any such action,
     suit or proceeding thereafter.

     9.2 Indemnification by Parent.

          (a) Subject to the  limitations  set forth in this Article 9, from and
     after the Closing, Parent agrees to indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates (in
     their  capacity  as such  and  not as  lendors)  and any of its  respective
     agents,  employees,  officers and directors (each, a "Purchaser Indemnified
     Party" and collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), against, and
     agrees to hold  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  harmless from, any and all
     losses,  costs,  damages,   penalties,   fines,  liabilities  and  expenses
     (including  reasonable legal fees and expenses and costs, fees and expenses
     incurred in pursuing  indemnification under this Agreement)  (collectively,
     "Damages") incurred or sustained by any Purchaser  Indemnified Party to the
     extent arising out of:

               (i) any  breach of any  representation  or  warranty  by  Sellers
          contained in this Agreement or in the certificate set forth in Section
          6.7; and

               (ii) a breach by Sellers  of any  covenants  or other  agreements
          contained herein that are to be performed following the Closing Date.

     Following  the  Closing,  solely  for  purposes  of  determining  whether a
representation or warranty that is qualified by reference to matters "that would
not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect" or
language of similar  import has been breached for purposes of Section  9.2(a)(i)
only,  such Material  Adverse Effect  qualifier shall be disregarded and in lieu
thereof  such  representation  or warranty  shall be deemed to be  qualified  by
reference to matters "that would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  give
rise to Damages of  $1,000,000  or more";  provided,  however,  that the parties
acknowledge and agree that such $1,000,000 Damage threshold shall not be applied
for purposes of  determining  whether a Material  Adverse  Effect  exists or has
occurred.

          (b) The aggregate indemnification obligation for Damages under Section
     9.2(a)(i)  (other than in respect of Damages arising out of breaches of the
     representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.9)
     shall not exceed $30,000,000.00.

     9.3  Indemnification  by Purchaser.  From and after the Closing,  Purchaser
agrees  to  indemnify  Sellers,  their  Affiliates  and any of their  respective
agents,   employees,   officers,   managers,  and  directors  (each,  a  "Seller
Indemnified Party" and collectively,  the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against,
and agrees to hold Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from, any and all Damages
incurred or sustained by any Seller  Indemnified Party to the extent arising out
of any of the following:

          (a)  any  breach  of  any  representation  or  warranty  by  Purchaser
     contained in this Agreement or in the certificate set forth in Section 7.7;
     and

          (b) a breach by Purchaser of any covenant or other agreement contained
     herein that is to be performed following the Closing Date.

     9.4 Basket for Claims.

          (a) No claim for Damages arising out of any breach (except for Damages
     from a breach of a representation  and warranty  contained in Sections 3.1,
     3.2,  3.3 and  3.9)  shall  be made  under  Section  9.2(a)(i)  unless  the
     aggregate  amount  of  Damages  for which  claims  are made  under  Section
     9.2(a)(i) exceeds  $5,000,000.00  (the "Parent's  Basket"),  in which case,
     Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties shall be entitled to seek compensation only
     for  Damages in excess of such  amount,  subject to Section  9.2(b).  There
     shall be no Parent's  Basket for breaches of Sections  3.1,  3.2,  3.3, and
     3.9.


                                       50
<PAGE>

          (b)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Agreement  to the
     contrary,  Parent  shall  have no  obligation  to  provide  indemnification
     pursuant to Sections  9.2(a)(i)  (other than in respect of Damages  arising
     out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Sections
     3.1,  3.2, 3.3 and 3.9) (and no amount shall be deducted  from the Parent's
     Basket) with respect to any  individual  claim for  indemnification  by the
     Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  except to the  extent  that the  amount of
     indemnification  to which the  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  shall  have
     become entitled to under Section 9.2 with respect to such individual  claim
     for  indemnification  shall exceed $100,000.  All such individual claims in
     amounts that exceed $100,000 shall be applied against the Parent's  Basket,
     and if  and  when  such  Parent's  Basket  is  exceeded,  Parent  shall  be
     obligated,  subject to the other  provisions  of this Article 9 (including,
     without  limitation,  Section  9.4(a)),  to  provide  indemnification  with
     respect to such individual claim.

     9.5 Net Losses; Subrogation; Mitigation.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained herein to the contrary,  the
     amount of any Damages incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Party shall be
     calculated  after  giving  effect to (i) any  insurance  proceeds  actually
     received by the Indemnified  Party (or any of its Affiliates)  with respect
     to such Damages,  (ii) any Tax Advantage  realized by the Indemnified Party
     (or any of its Affiliates)  arising from the facts or circumstances  giving
     rise to such Damages,  and (iii) any  recoveries  actually  received by the
     Indemnified  Party (or any of its  Affiliates)  from any other third party.
     Each Indemnified Party shall exercise  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
     obtain  such  proceeds,  benefits  and  recoveries.  If any such  proceeds,
     benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified  Party (or any of its
     Affiliates)  with respect to any Damages  after an  Indemnifying  Party has
     made  a  payment  to  the  Indemnified  Party  with  respect  thereto,  the
     Indemnified  Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying  Party
     the amount of such  proceeds,  benefits or recoveries  (up to the amount of
     the Indemnifying Party's payment).

          (b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified  Party in respect of any
     Damages,  and the  Indemnified  Party's  payment  in full of  Damages,  the
     Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such payment by the Indemnifying
     Party,  be  subrogated  to all  rights of the  Indemnified  Party  (and its
     Affiliates) against any third party in respect of the Damages to which such
     payment  relates.   Such   Indemnified   Party  (and  its  Affiliates)  and
     Indemnifying  Party shall execute upon request all  instruments  reasonably
     necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.

          (c) Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
     mitigate any Damages,  including by asserting claims against a third party;
     provided,  that no party  shall be  required  to use such  efforts  if they
     reasonably  believe  such  actions  would be  detrimental  in any  material
     respect  to such  party.  For  avoidance  of doubt,  any costs or  expenses
     involved in undertaking mitigation shall be included in Damages.

          (d) To the extent  that any breach of any  representation  or warranty
     contained in this  Agreement  or any breach of any other  provision of this
     Agreement  that  arises  after  the  Closing  is  capable  of  remedy,  the
     Indemnified  Party  shall  afford  the  Indemnifying   Party  a  reasonable
     opportunity to remedy the matter complained of.


                                       51

     9.6 Claims.  As promptly as is reasonably  practicable after becoming aware
of a claim for  indemnification  under this  Agreement  that does not  involve a
Third Party Claim (as defined in Section 9.7), the Indemnified  Party shall give
notice to the  Indemnifying  Party of such claim,  which  notice  shall,  to the
extent such information is reasonably  available,  specify in reasonable  detail
the facts alleged to constitute the basis for such claim,  the  representations,
warranties,  covenants  and  obligations  alleged to have been  breached and the
amount  that  the  Indemnified  Party  seeks  hereunder,   if  known,  from  the
Indemnifying  Party,  together  with  such  information,   to  the  extent  such
information is reasonably  available,  as may be reasonably  necessary to assist
the  Indemnifying  Party in determining that the limitations in Section 9.4 have
been satisfied or do not apply.  No failure to provide notice under this Section
9.6 or under Section 9.7 in the time frames  specified shall adversely affect an
Indemnified  Party's  rights  to  indemnification   except  to  the  extent  the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced or harmed by such failure.

     9.7 Notice of Third Party Claims;  Assumption of Defense.  The  Indemnified
Party shall give notice as promptly  as is  reasonably  practicable,  but in any
event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after  receiving  notice thereof,
to the Indemnifying  Party of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit,  action or proceeding,  by any Person not a party hereto in respect of
which  indemnity  may be sought under this  Agreement  (a "Third  Party  Claim")
(which notice shall,  to the extent such  information  is reasonably  available,
specify in reasonable  detail the facts alleged to constitute the basis for such
claim, the  representations,  warranties,  covenants and obligations  alleged to
have been breached and the amount of such claim  together with such  information
as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Party to determine that the limitations
in Section 9.4 have been  satisfied  or do not apply).  The  Indemnifying  Party
shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against any such claim with
counsel of its choice  reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long
as the  Indemnifying  Party  notifies the  Indemnified  Party in writing  within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the claim that
the Indemnifying  Party shall assume the defense of such claim.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall not be  entitled  to assume the
defense  of any such  claim if the  claim  seeks an order,  injunction  or other
equitable  relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnified  Party reasonably  determines,  after conferring with
its outside  counsel and the  Indemnifying  Party's outside  counsel,  cannot be
separated from any related claim for money damages.  If such equitable relief or
other  relief  portion of such claim can be so  separated  from that portion for
money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of
the portion relating to money damages.

     If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right (but not the duty) to participate  in the defense  thereof and to
employ counsel,  at its own expense,  separate from the counsel  employed by the
Indemnifying  Party.  To  the  extent  the  Indemnified  Party  is  entitled  to
indemnification  hereunder with respect to such claim,  if and to the extent the
Indemnifying  Party does not assume the defense of any such claim,  suit, action
or proceeding,  the Indemnifying  Party shall nonetheless be responsible for the
payment when due of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in defense of the
claim, suit, action or proceeding. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses
to defend or prosecute any such claim,  suit,  action or proceeding,  all of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

     9.8 Settlement or Compromise.  Any settlement or compromise  made or caused
to be made by the Indemnified  Party or the Indemnifying  Party, as the case may
be, of any such claim,  suit,  action or  proceeding  of the kind referred to in
Section 9.7 shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party,  as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final  judgment or decree
had been  entered  by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  in the amount of such
settlement or compromise;  provided, that (i) no obligation or restriction shall
be imposed on the Indemnified Party as a result of such settlement or compromise
without  its  prior  written  consent  and no  Damage  shall be  imposed  on the
Indemnified Party as a result of such settlement or compromise without its prior
written consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the
Indemnified  Party will not  compromise  or settle any  claim,  suit,  action or
proceeding  without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying  Party,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.


                                       52
<PAGE>

     9.9 Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding any provision herein, neither
of  Sellers  nor  Purchaser  shall in any event be  liable to the other  parties
hereto,   Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  or  Seller  Indemnified  Parties,  as
applicable,  on  account  of any  breach of this  Agreement  or any of the other
Transaction Documents for any indirect,  consequential,  special,  incidental or
punitive damages.  Each of Sellers and Purchaser  acknowledge and agree that for
purposes of this Article 9, any damages actually paid by or on behalf of them to
a third  party in respect of a Third  Party  Claim  shall be  considered  direct
damages rather than  indirect,  consequential,  special,  incidental or punitive
damages.

     9.10  Exclusive  Remedy.   Following  the  Closing,   the   indemnification
provisions  set  forth  in this  Article  9 and  Article  10 shall  provide  the
exclusive  remedy  for  breach of any  covenant,  agreement,  representation  or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, except that the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article 9 and Article 10 do not limit (i) either parties right
to seek  equitable  relief in a court of  competent  jurisdiction  to prevent or
remedy a breach  of the  other  party's  obligations  hereunder,  including  the
obligations set forth in Section 5.4, (ii) any party's  remedies for breaches of
the non-competition and  non-solicitation  provisions contained in Section 5.19,
or (iii) any party's remedies with respect to fraud by the other party.

     9.11 Purchase Price  Adjustments.  Any amounts payable under Section 9.2 or
Section 9.3 shall be treated by Purchaser  and Sellers as an  adjustment  to the
Purchase Price.

                                   ARTICLE 10.
                                   TAX MATTERS

10.1     Filing Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

          (a) Sellers  shall cause to be prepared  and filed in a timely  manner
     all Tax  Returns  for Income  Taxes with  respect  to the  income,  assets,
     properties or operations of the Company for all periods ending on or before
     the  Closing  Date   ("Pre-Closing  Tax  Periods"),   including  for  those
     jurisdictions  and Governmental  Authorities that permit or require a short
     period Tax Return for Income  Taxes,  for the period  ending on the Closing
     Date.  All  such  Tax  Returns  shall  be  prepared  and  filed in a manner
     consistent  with  past  practice  of the  Company,  except as  required  by
     applicable Law.  Without undue disruption to the operations of the Company,
     Purchaser  shall  cause the  Company to  cooperate  fully and  promptly  in
     connection with Sellers'  preparation and filing of such returns. The books
     and records of the Company will be  maintained,  and the Tax Returns of the
     Company will be filed,  so as to accurately  reflect the  operations of the
     Company through the end of the Closing Date.

          (b) Purchaser  shall cause to be prepared and filed in a timely manner
     all other Tax  Returns  required  to be filed by the  Company  for  periods
     ending on or before the Closing Date and for Straddle Periods, after giving
     Sellers  the  opportunity  to review and  approve  (not to be  unreasonably
     withheld) any Tax Return relating to a Tax Period including any pre-Closing
     item;  provided,  however,  that Sellers shall be responsible for any Taxes
     shown on such Tax Returns  that are  attributable  to the  Pre-Closing  Tax
     Period or that portion of a Straddle  Period  relating to the period ending
     on the Closing Date except to the extent such Taxes have been  reserved for
     as a liability on the Closing  Balance Sheet and resulted in a reduction to
     the Purchase Price under Section 2.3 hereof.

          (c) None of  Purchaser  or any of its  Affiliates  shall (or after the
     Closing,  shall cause or permit the Company to) amend,  refile or otherwise
     modify (or grant an  extension of any statute of  limitations  with respect
     to) any Tax Return  relating  in whole or in part to the  Company  (i) with
     respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) with respect to any Straddle
     Periods without the prior written  consent of Sellers,  which consent shall
     not be unreasonably withheld. If any position on any Tax Return filed after
     the Closing Date with  respect to the Company for Tax Periods  beginning on
     or after the Closing  Date could  reasonably  be expected to affect the Tax
     liability of Sellers,  Purchaser  shall notify  Sellers and shall take such
     position on such Tax Return only with the approval of Sellers,  which shall
     not be unreasonably withheld.


                                       53
<PAGE>

          (d) For purposes of this  Agreement,  Taxes for periods that  include,
     but do not end on the Closing  Date shall be  apportioned  as follows:  (i)
     Taxes that are based on or measured by income or gross  receipts or imposed
     in  connection  with any sale,  transfer or  assignment or any deemed sale,
     transfer or assignment of property, shall be determined based on an interim
     closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date,  (ii)
     Taxes (other than those described in clause (i)),  shall be deemed equal to
     the amount of Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction,
     the  numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the taxable
     period  ending on the Closing  Date,  and the  denominator  of which is the
     total number of days in the entire Taxable Period.

     10.2 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

          (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 10.5, Purchaser,  the Company
     and  Sellers  shall  cooperate  fully,  as  and to  the  extent  reasonably
     requested by the other party,  in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
     pursuant to this Article 10. Such  cooperation  shall include the retention
     and  (upon  the  other  party's  request)  the  provision  of  records  and
     information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,  litigation or
     other  proceeding and making employees  available on a mutually  convenient
     basis to provide  additional  information  and  explanation of any material
     provided hereunder.  Personnel of the Company shall be available to execute
     Tax  statute of  limitation  waivers  and  amended  Tax Returns at Sellers'
     request for the Tax Returns for the Tax Period  prior to the Closing  Date.
     Purchaser  and Sellers  shall (i) retain all books and records with respect
     to Tax  matters  pertinent  to the Company  relating to any Taxable  Period
     beginning  before the Closing Date until the  expiration of the  applicable
     statute  of  limitations  (and,  to the extent  notified  by  Purchaser  or
     Sellers,  any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable Periods, and to
     abide by all  record  retention  agreements  entered  into with any  taxing
     authority and (ii) give the other party reasonable  written notice prior to
     transferring,  destroying or discarding  any such books and records and, if
     the other party so  requests,  Purchaser  or  Sellers,  as the case may be,
     shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

          (b) Purchaser and Sellers, upon reasonable request by the other party,
     shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
     other document from any  Governmental  Authority or any other Person as may
     be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
     (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

     10.3 Tax Indemnification.  Without duplication,  Parent agrees to indemnify
Purchaser  Indemnified Parties against and agrees to hold Purchaser  Indemnified
Parties harmless from any and all Taxes imposed on the Company in respect of its
income, business, property or operations, or for which the Company may otherwise
be liable,  for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and that portion of a Straddle Period
relating  to the period  ending on the Closing  Date,  except to the extent such
Taxes have been  reserved  for as a liability on the Closing  Balance  Sheet and
resulted  in a  reduction  to the  Purchase  Price  under  Section  2.3  hereof.
Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary  herein,  Parent's  obligation to
indemnify  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  under this Section 10.3 shall not be
subject to the limitations on indemnification under Section 9.4.

     10.4 Refunds.


                                       54
<PAGE>

          (a) Any  required  amended Tax Return  relating to a  Pre-Closing  Tax
     Period or that portion of a Straddle  Period  relating to the period ending
     on the Closing Date and any refund  claims  relating to a  Pre-Closing  Tax
     Period or that portion of a Straddle  Period  relating to the period ending
     on the Closing Date shall be prepared by Sellers.

          (b) Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing
     Tax  Period or that  portion of a Straddle  Period  relating  to the period
     ending on the Closing  Date shall be for the benefit of Sellers  (except to
     the  extent  such  refunds  have been  accrued  as an asset on the  Closing
     Balance  Sheet and  resulted  in an increase  to the  Purchase  Price under
     Section  2.3  hereof)  and any  refunds or credits of the  Company for that
     portion of a Straddle  Period  beginning  on the day after the Closing Date
     shall be for the benefit of Purchaser.

          (c)  Purchaser  shall  promptly  pay over (or cause the Company to pay
     over) to Sellers all refunds  received by  Purchaser or its  Affiliates  to
     which Sellers are entitled under this Section 10.4 (including interest with
     respect  thereto),  and Sellers shall promptly pay or cause to be paid over
     to  Purchaser  (or the  Company)  all  refunds to which  Purchaser  (or the
     Company) is entitled  under this  Section  10.4  (including  interest  with
     respect thereto).

     10.5 Audits and Contests with Respect to Taxes.

          (a) So long as Taxable Periods of the Company ending on or before,  or
     including, the Closing Date remain open for an assessment of Tax, Purchaser
     and Sellers shall notify the other in writing  within fifteen (15) Business
     Days after receipt by Purchaser or Sellers of written or oral notice of:

               (i) any pending or threatened audit or assessment with respect to
          Taxes  of the  Company  relating  to any  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  or
          Straddle Period, and

               (ii) any pending or threatened  audit or assessment  with respect
          to Taxes of  Purchaser  that may  affect  the Tax  liabilities  of the
          Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

          (b) Within  fifteen (15)  Business  Days after  Sellers'  receipt of a
     notice respecting an item or items for which it is responsible  pursuant to
     Section  9.2,  Sellers may elect,  so long as Parent has an  obligation  to
     indemnify  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties  hereunder  with respect to such
     audit,  by written notice to Purchaser,  to contest the audit or assessment
     in the name of the Company. If Sellers so elect, Sellers, at their expense,
     shall be  responsible  for the  defense  of the  item or  items  at  issue;
     provided,  however,  that Purchaser shall have the right (but not the duty)
     to participate  in the defense  thereof and to employ  counsel,  at its own
     expense,  separate  from the counsel  employed  by  Sellers,  and agrees to
     cooperate,  and will cause the Company to cooperate, in the contest of such
     audit or assessment by making relevant documents and employees available to
     Sellers,  and to execute such documents  (including  powers of attorney) as
     may be  reasonably  necessary to allow  Sellers to conduct the defense.  If
     Sellers elect to conduct a defense,  then all decisions with respect to the
     negotiation,  settlement, or litigation of the item or items at issue shall
     be made by Sellers and shall be binding upon Purchaser, except that Sellers
     shall not agree to any adjustment, or making any Tax election, that will or
     may create an increase in Taxes for the Company or  Purchaser in respect of
     any period ending after the Closing Date without the prior written  consent
     of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and, subject
     to Section  9.10 hereof and so long as Sellers are  obligated  to indemnify
     Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties hereunder with respect to such audit, shall
     promptly indemnify Purchaser for, and hold Purchaser harmless against,  any
     such  increase and no payment  shall be made under this Section 10.5 to the
     extent that the related Tax Benefits or Tax Detriments have been accrued on
     the Closing  Balance  Sheet and resulted in an  adjustment  to the Purchase
     Price under Section 2.3 hereof.


                                       55

     10.6 Audit Adjustments.

          (a) If as a result of the examination of the federal,  state, or local
     income  or  franchise  Tax  Returns  of  the  Company,   or  any  group  of
     corporations  that  includes  the Company  for a taxable  year ending on or
     before,  or  including,  the  Closing  Date,  there shall be made after the
     Closing Date any adjustment that increases  deductions,  losses, or credits
     against  Taxes or that  decreases  income,  gain or  recapture  of  credits
     against Taxes ("Tax Benefits") or that increases income, gain, or recapture
     of credits against Taxes or decreases deductions, losses or credits against
     Taxes ("Tax  Detriments") for any taxable year and that will permit Sellers
     or the  Company  (or any  entity  that is  included  in a Tax  Return  that
     includes Purchaser or the Company) to increase the Tax Benefits or decrease
     the Tax Detriments to which they would otherwise have been entitled for any
     taxable year  beginning on or after the Closing  Date,  Sellers will notify
     Purchaser of such adjustment and provide Purchaser with such information as
     may be  necessary  for  Purchaser  to take  account  of such  increases  or
     decreases  through the filing of a claim of refund or otherwise.  Purchaser
     shall take any reasonable  actions  necessary to secure the benefit of such
     increases or decreases. In any taxable year in which the net effect of such
     adjustments  is a Tax Benefit to the  Company,  Purchaser  shall  indemnify
     Sellers for such benefit (plus any interest  actually received by Purchaser
     from the relevant Tax authority,  less Purchaser's  reasonable net expenses
     incurred in securing such  benefit)  within thirty (30) Business Days after
     the Tax  Return  reflecting  those net Tax  Benefits  is filed;  if the net
     effect is a Tax Detriment to the Company, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser
     for such detriment (plus any reasonable  expenses of Purchaser  incurred in
     attempting to mitigate such detriment) to the extent that such detriment is
     not indemnified  pursuant to this Section 10.6, within thirty (30) Business
     Days after the Tax Return reflecting those net Tax Detriments is filed. If,
     after Purchaser or Sellers have made a payment to the other in respect of a
     Tax  Benefit or Tax  Detriment,  there is a  subsequent  adjustment  in the
     amount of such Tax Benefit or Tax  Detriment as a result of an  examination
     by federal,  state, or local Tax authorities,  Purchaser or Sellers, as the
     case may be,  shall  make an  appropriate  payment  for the  amount of such
     adjustment  in such Tax Benefit or Tax  Detriment,  promptly  after the Tax
     Return  reflecting  such  adjustment  is filed.  Each  party  agrees to use
     commercially  reasonable efforts to defend against any such adjustment that
     is  a  decrease  in  Tax  Benefits  or  an  increase  in  Tax   Detriments.
     Notwithstanding  any other provision  contained  herein,  this Section 10.6
     shall be subject  to the  limitations  set forth in Section  9.10 and shall
     apply only so long as Sellers and  Purchaser  are  obligated  hereunder  to
     indemnify  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties or Seller  Indemnified  Parties,
     respectively, with respect to such audit and no payment shall be made under
     this  Section  10.6 to the extent  that the  related  Tax  Benefits  or Tax
     Detriments  have been accrued on the Closing  Balance Sheet and resulted in
     an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.3 hereof.

          (b) In  calculating  any  amount to be  indemnified  pursuant  to this
     Section  10.6,  each  party  shall be  deemed to be  subject  to Tax at the
     combined effective Tax rate for the Taxable Period in question, taking into
     account the appropriate state apportionment  factors of the Company for the
     Taxable Period in question. Any payment pursuant to this Section 10.6 shall
     constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Agreement.

     10.7 Tax Withholding.  Sellers and Purchaser agree that for the purposes of
FICA Tax withholding  and any comparable  state or local Tax withholding (to the
extent permitted under  applicable state and local Laws),  Purchaser shall treat
all wages paid by the Company in 2005 to each current Company Employee,  if any,
who  becomes  employed  by  Purchaser  immediately  after the Closing as paid by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 3121 of the Code and any comparable  provisions of
applicable state and local Laws, and Sellers agree to provide Purchaser with all
related documentation,  including,  without limitation, a completed W-4 form for
each such Company Employee. Sellers and Purchaser agree to follow the "Alternate
Procedure for Predecessors and Successors" as set forth in IRS Revenue Procedure
2004-53. Sellers and Purchaser agree, in accordance with such procedure, to each
file with the Internal Revenue Service a Schedule D (Form 941) with the Form 941
for the first  quarter  of 2006.  Sellers  agree to provide  Purchaser  with all
information necessary for Purchaser to assume the Company's 2006 W-2 obligations
with respect to each current Company  Employee,  if any, who becomes employed by
Purchaser immediately after the Closing.


                                       56

     10.8  Tax  Sharing  Agreements.  All  tax  sharing  agreements  or  similar
arrangements  with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and,  after the Closing  Date,  the Company  shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

PUC Consents or FCC Consents.  All fees  (including  notarial fees) or transfer,
conveyance,  sales,  use or  similar  Taxes on or with  respect  to the sale and

transfer or deemed  transfer of the assets of the Company)  shall be paid by the

     11.4  Waivers.  Subject  to the  limitations  contained  in this  Agreement
(including,  without limitation, those set forth in Section 9.1), the failure of
a party to require  performance  of any  provision  hereof  shall not affect its
right at a later  time to  enforce  the same.  No waiver by a party of any term,
covenant,  representation or warranty contained herein shall be effective unless
in  writing.  No such  waiver in any one  instance  shall be deemed a further or
continuing waiver of any such term, covenant,  representation or warranty in any
other instance.

     11.5 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original,  but all of which together  shall  constitute

enforced in accordance with the internal Laws, and not the laws of conflicts, of
the State of  Delaware.  THE PARTIES  EACH  HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY  AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION  OR  CAUSE  OF  ACTION  BASED  ON,  OR  ARISING  OUT OF,  UNDER OR IN
CONJUNCTION IN ANY MANNER WITH TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

<PAGE>

     11.8  Assignment.  This  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their  respective  successors and assigns;  provided,
that no assignment of either party's  rights or obligations  may be made without
the written  consent of the other party and any such  assignment  shall  provide
that the assigning party will continue to be bound by all obligations  hereunder
as if such  assignment  had not  occurred and perform  such  obligations  to the
extent that its assignee fails to do so.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this
Agreement  may be  assigned by a party (the  "Assigning  Party")  after  Closing
without  the  consent  of the other  party  (the  "Non-assigning  Party")  to an
Affiliate of the Assigning Party, provided that advance notice of the assignment
is given to the  Non-assigning  Party,  such  Affiliate  enters  into a  written
agreement  with the  Non-assigning  Party to be bound by the  provisions of this
Agreement in all respects and to the same extent as the Assigning Party is bound
and  that the  Assigning  Party  will  continue  to be bound by all  obligations
hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and perform such obligations to
the extent that such Affiliate fails to do so.

     11.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the parties  hereto;  provided  that in  addition  to Sellers and  Purchaser,
Seller Indemnified  Parties and Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties, as the case may
be, shall also enjoy the benefits of indemnities made herein which are expressly
stated to be in their favor;  provided,  however,  that no Person other than the
parties hereto shall have the right to enforce the provisions of Section 5.5. In
this regard, the parties agree that such Persons shall have the right to enforce
those provisions directly against the applicable Indemnifying Party.

     11.10  Schedules.  Neither the  specification  of any dollar  amount in any
representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in any Schedule  hereto is intended to imply that such amount,  or
higher or lower amounts,  or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material,  and no  party  shall  use the fact of the  setting  forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or  controversy  between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any Schedule is or is not  material for purposes of this  Agreement.
Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification
of any item or  matter  in any  representation  or  warranty  contained  in this
Agreement  nor the  inclusion  of any specific  item in any  Schedule  hereto is
intended to imply that such item or matter,  or other  items or matters,  are or
are not in the ordinary  course of business,  and no party shall use the fact of
the setting  forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course
of business for purposes of this Agreement.

     11.11  Incorporation.  The  respective  Schedules,  Exhibits and Appendices
attached hereto and referred to herein are incorporated  into and form a part of
this Agreement.

     11.12 Complete Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement  constitute the complete  agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject  matter  hereof and supersede all prior  discussions,  negotiations  and
understandings.

     11.13 Public Announcements.  Sellers and Purchaser each agree that they and
their  Affiliates shall not issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or respond to any media inquiry with respect to this  Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  without  the  prior  approval  of the  other
parties,  which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,  except as may be
required by Law or by any stock  exchanges  having  jurisdiction  over  Sellers,
Purchaser or their respective Affiliates.

     11.14 Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement,  or
the  application  thereof  becomes  or  is  declared  by a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction  to be  illegal,  void  or  unenforceable,  the  remainder  of this
Agreement  will  continue in full force and effect and the  application  of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect  the intent of the  parties  thereto.  The  parties  further  agree to

                                       59
<PAGE>

replace such void or unenforceable  provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable  provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,  the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
