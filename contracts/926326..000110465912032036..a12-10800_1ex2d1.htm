multiplied by the number of Fully Diluted Shares.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Effect on Stock_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Holder, and subject to the other provisions of this
_Section 3.7_ :

 



 

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be (x)
converted into the right to receive, upon the surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such share of Series A Preferred Stock, an amount equal
to the portion of the Series A Preferred Redemption Amount set forth on the
Closing Statement allocable to such share of Series A Preferred Stock and (y)
immediately cancelled.

 



 

(ii) Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock shall be (x) converted
into the right to receive, upon the surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such share of Common Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share
Closing Consideration set forth on the Closing Statement, and (y) immediately
cancelled.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) each issued and outstanding
share of Incentive Stock (whether or not then vested) shall vest and (ii) each
issued and outstanding share of Incentive Stock shall automatically become
convertible into shares of Non-Voting Common Stock (as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation). As a result, all holders of Incentive Stock
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares) shall be Closing Common Stockholders
at the Effective Time and shall be entitled to receive their Per Share Closing
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Holder, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and such common stock of
the Surviving Corporation issued on that conversion will constitute all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Shares of Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by a Holder, as applicable, who has
not voted such shares in favor of the Merger and who has properly demanded or
may properly demand appraisal rights in the manner provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive a portion of the Closing Consideration unless and until the Effective
Time has occurred and the holder of such Dissenting Shares becomes ineligible
for such appraisal rights. The holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL and promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
notify the holders of Common Stock of their rights (if any) to demand
appraisal of and payment for their shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
by sending a notice prepared in accordance with Section 262(d) of the DGCL
that is accompanied by a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefore from the
Purchaser in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if
any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish
entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, (b) if
any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn demand
for appraisal of such shares or lost the right to appraisal and payment for
shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or (c) if neither any holder of
Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition
demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the
time provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder of Dissenting Shares
shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such Dissenting
Share shall be treated as if it had been, as of the Effective Time, converted
into a right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing Consideration,
without interest thereon, as provided in _Section 3.6_ of this Agreement. The
Company shall give the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (i) prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Common Stock, (ii) a copy of each such demand, if any, and all related
information requested by the Purchaser and (iii) the opportunity to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Purchaser in each instance, make any payment with
respect to any such demands for appraisal, or settle, or offer to settle, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) Prior to receiving any portion of the Closing Consideration, each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock (the
" _Certificates_ ") shall have delivered to the Paying Agent (i) a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in the form of _Exhibit
3.8(a)_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) the Certificates, if any,
held of record by such holder. Such Letter of Transmittal shall have been
previously delivered by the Paying Agent to such holder at or promptly
following the Effective Time along with instructions thereto and a notice to
the effect that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Paying Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.6_ , and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. If the portion of the Closing Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the exchange to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.8_ , each Certificate
shall be deemed as of the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
_Section 3.8(a)_ , the consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_. If any
certificate evidencing any share of Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance of any consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.6_ , require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit with respect to such
certificate.

 



 

(b) All Closing Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
represented by such Certificates and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the portion of the Closing Consideration as
provided in this _Article III_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At any time following the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto but excluding for all purposes the Stockholder Representative
Reserve) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to the Holders, and thereafter, such Holders shall be entitled
to look only to the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Closing Consideration that would
otherwise be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such Holders,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such Holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of the
Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) The Paying Agent, its designee, the Stockholder Representative the
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as
appropriate) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Payment of Other Amounts Payable at Closing_. On the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall:

 



 

(a) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, pay to such account or
accounts as the Company specifies to the Purchaser the aggregate amount of the
Closing Date Indebtedness;

 



 

(b) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, pay to such account or
accounts as the Company specifies in the Closing Statement the aggregate
amount of the Transaction Expenses, to the extent not paid prior to the
Closing Date; and

 



 

(c) on behalf of the Company, pay to such account or accounts as the Company
specifies to the Purchaser to the extent not paid prior to the Closing Date,
the aggregate amount of the DandO Tail Premium.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) No later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a draft balance
sheet of the Company as of the time of the Closing (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), which Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Balance Sheet shall include a good faith calculation of each of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Surplus, if any, and the Working
Capital Deficit, if any, along with reasonable supporting documentation.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet during which to notify the Purchaser of
any dispute of any item contained in the Closing Balance Sheet, which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. At any time
within such thirty (30)-day period, the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to agree with any or all of the items set forth in the Closing
Balance Sheet.

 



 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative does not notify the Purchaser of any
such dispute within such thirty (30)-day period, or notifies the Purchaser of
its agreement with the adjustments in the Closing Balance Sheet prior to the
expiration of the thirty (30)-day period, the Closing Balance Sheet prepared
by the Purchaser shall be deemed to be the " _Final Balance Sheet_ ," and
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and the Holders.

 



 

(d) If the Stockholder Representative notifies the Purchaser of any such
dispute within such thirty (30)-day period, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be
resolved as follows:

 



 

(i) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible.

 



 

(ii) In the event the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable
to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall mutually agree in
writing) of notice of such dispute, such dispute and each Partys work papers
related thereto shall be submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such
dispute shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrators resolution shall
be final and binding on the Parties, be based solely on presentations of the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative and not on the Arbitrators
independent review, and shall be limited to only those matters in dispute. The
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Arbitrator to complete its work within thirty (30) days
following its engagement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall
be paid one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the Holders.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative jointly shall modify the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Working Capital Surplus, if any, and the Working Capital Deficit,
if any, as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the Stockholder
Representatives objections (as agreed upon

 



      
 

 



 

by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative or as determined by the
Arbitrator) and deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and such calculations to the
Stockholder Representative within ten (10) days after the resolution of such
objections. Such revised balance sheet shall be deemed to be the "Final
Balance Sheet," and shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the Parties.

 



 

(f) For purposes of determining the information on the Final Balance Sheet,
the Parties may take into consideration all facts and circumstances which are
known prior to the final determination of the Final Balance Sheet.

 



 

(g) If there is a Working Capital Deficit reflected on the Final Balance Sheet
then:

 



 

(i) if the Working Capital Deficit is less than the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, within five (5) Business Days after the Purchasers delivery of the
Final Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative, the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver,
in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check from the Escrow
Account: (A) first, to the Purchaser, the Working Capital Deficit; and (B)
then to the Paying Agent, for distribution to the Closing Common Stockholders
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, the amount equal to
the difference between the Working Capital Escrow Amount minus the Working
Capital Deficit; or

 



 

(ii) if the Working Capital Deficit is equal to or greater than the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, within five (5) Business Days after the Purchasers
delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative, the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to deliver to the Purchaser all of the funds in the Working Capital
Escrow Account, in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check from
the Escrow Account; provided that in no event shall the Purchaser be paid an
amount in excess of the funds available in the Working Capital Escrow Account,
regardless of the Working Capital Deficit amount.

 



 

(h) If there is a Working Capital Surplus reflected on the Final Balance Sheet
then within five (5) Business Days after the Purchasers delivery of the Final
Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative (or, if the Stockholder
Representative has objected to such Final Balance Sheet, the date of
determination of the Final Balance Sheet pursuant to _Section 3.10(e)_ ), (i)
the Purchaser shall deliver the Working Capital Surplus in immediately
available funds by wire transfer or check to the Paying Agent for distribution
to the Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages; and
(ii) the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to immediately deliver to the Paying Agent, for distribution to
the Holders in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, the Working Capital Escrow Amount
in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check.

The Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser that except as set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being understood that (i) the Company
Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to specific

Schedule of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed on such
other Schedule or Schedules of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent
that its relevance or applicability to information called for by such other
Schedule or Schedules is readily apparent on its face, notwithstanding the
omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto, and (iii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents an exception or a material fact, event or circumstance or an
admission of liability to any Person or that such item has or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect):

Effect. The Company has previously made available to the Purchaser complete
copies of the charter and bylaws (or equivalent documents) of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries as currently in effect.

Section 6.2 _Certain Filings_.

 



 

(a) The Company and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other (i) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any

mutual agreement shall seek early termination of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, and (ii) shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to

for any reason, including to provide the applicable Governmental Entity with
additional time to review any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (y) consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Purchasers undertaking pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_ hereof, the Purchaser agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to
enable the Parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in connection with obtaining approval from

with the efforts to effectuate this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required
to, and the Company and its Affiliates may not, without the prior written

of their respective Affiliates (or consent to any of the foregoing actions).

 



 

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other to review

Entity. Neither the Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other
hand, shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the business, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to the extent that that such
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns are not
governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine.

Section 6.8 _Company Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) With respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue
employment with Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (and their dependents and
beneficiaries where applicable) (collectively, the " _Continuing Benefit Plan
Participants_ " and each such individual, a " _Continuing Benefit Plan
Participant_ "), except to the extent any of the following would result in a
duplication of benefits, would not be permitted under the terms of any
applicable Employee Benefit Plan of the Purchaser, or for such time as the
Company Benefit Plans providing similar benefits are continued following the
Closing as provided below: (i) the Purchaser agrees to permit such employees
to enroll in and be eligible for all of the Purchasers Employee Benefit
Plans, as in effect from time to time,

 



       
 

 



 

to the same extent as similarly situated employees of the Purchaser; and (ii)
for purposes of determining such employees eligibility to participate in such
employee benefit plans, the Purchaser shall as of the Closing (A) recognize
such employees employment service with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
(including credit for service with predecessor employers as currently
recognized under the applicable Company Benefit Plans) for participation,
vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual purposes (other than for accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan) under any Employee Benefit Plan that
the Purchaser may provide to such employees, (B) use commercially reasonable
efforts to not require such employees, in the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum
or similar requirement under the Purchasers plans to the extent of amounts
previously credited for such purposes under the applicable plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (C) use commercially reasonable efforts to not
apply to such employees any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions
and requirements to show evidence of good health contained in any of the
Purchasers plans to the extent waiting periods, pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and requirements were satisfied under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plans and (D) honor in full all vacation accrued in accordance with
Company policy that is not taken for the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs. The foregoing requirement shall be subject to: (i) any necessary
transition period, (ii) any applicable Employee Benefit Plan provisions, (iii)
requirements of applicable Laws, (iv) any election that Purchaser may make, in
its sole discretion, to continue one or more of the Company Benefit Plans,
through no later than the later of (A) December 31, 2012, or (B) ninety (90)
days following the Closing, in which case the terms of this Section 6.8(a)
shall take effect once coverage under any such continued Company Benefit Plan
ceases. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit
plan, program or arrangement. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall be construed
to create a right in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
employment with the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.8(a) to the contrary, once Purchaser
ceases to continue the Company Benefit Plans providing medical, dental and
vision benefits, Purchaser shall cause all waiting periods under Purchasers
medical, dental and vision benefit plans to be waived for any Continuing
Benefit Plan Participant. Once Purchaser ceases to continue the Companys
401(k) Plan, Purchaser will recognize any employment service with the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries (including credit for service with predecessor
employers to the extent currently recognized under the Companys 401(k) Plan)
for participation, vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual purposes under the
Purchasers 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(c) If requested by the Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall take each of the following actions (i) adopt board
resolutions in a form acceptable to the Purchaser, to terminate the Companys
401(k) plan effective as of

potential continued eligibility for Retiree Health Benefits. Accordingly, the
Company shall require a timely submitted COBRA election as a condition to the

indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Damages which may be incurred or suffered by any such
Purchaser Indemnified Party and arise out of or result from any (i) breach of
any warranty or any inaccuracy of any representation contained in _Article
IV_ as of the date of this Agreement, or breach of any warranty or any
inaccuracy of any representation contained in _Article IV_ as if such
representation and warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date (in
each case without giving effect to any update of or modification to the
Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after
the date of this Agreement), (ii) breach of, or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of the Company, the Holders or the Stockholder
Representative contained in this Agreement, (iii) Transaction Expenses or
Closing Date Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries not paid prior to
or in connection with the Closing, (iv) inaccuracy in the Closing Statement,
(v) exercise by any stockholder of the Company of such stockholders
dissenters rights under the DGCL, but only for the amount that the Damages
exceed the consideration that the stockholder would have otherwise been
entitled to receive (as set forth in the Closing Statement) if such
stockholder did not assert its dissenters rights and (vi) any of the matters
described on Schedule 10.1; provided the Purchaser Indemnified Parties claim
therefor under clause (i) above is instituted by written notice to the
Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Release Date,

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article X_, the Holders
shall not be liable under this _Article X_ for any Damages unless and until
the aggregate amount of all such Damages incurred or suffered which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article X_ exceeds One Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand
Dollars ($1,560,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time the Holders shall

which exceed the Deductible.

 



 

(b) Subject to this _Section 10.1(b)_, with respect to any claim for
indemnification, the Holders shall not be liable under this _Article X_ for
any Damages which exceed, in the aggregate, the Indemnification Escrow Amount.
The foregoing limitation shall not apply: (a) in the event of fraud or willful
misconduct; (b) to the matters referred to in clauses "(iii)", "(iv)" and
"(vi)" of _Section 10.1_ above; or (c) breaches of any warranty or any

Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Parties shall not also be entitled to indemnification for any loss to the
extent such loss was taken into account in the Working Capital Deficit. None
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article X_ for any claim to the extent such claim relates to an
item of Closing Date Net Working Capital and would be subject to _Section

(d) Damages shall be determined net of any insurance benefits or tax savings,
which are actually realized by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and that are
specifically related to the Damages. In the event the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Stockholder Representative cannot agree to the amount of such
tax savings actually realized in cash by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (or
whether such tax savings exists), such Parties shall jointly retain the
Arbitrator to calculate such tax savings, if any, which calculation shall be
binding on all Parties. The cost of such accountant shall be paid one-half by
the Holders, in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage, and one-half by the
Purchaser (or, at its election, the Surviving Corporation).

under any insurance policy with respect to any amount of Damages to the extent
that a reasonable Person would seek or continue to pursue recovery for such

Party, and such Purchaser Indemnified Party later receives insurance proceeds,
or tax benefits in cash in respect of the related Damages (as provided in the
immediately preceding subsection), such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay to the Stockholder Representative or its designee an amount equal
to the lesser of (y) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds, other third
party recoveries and tax benefits or (z) the actual amount of the
indemnification payment previously paid by the Holders with respect to such
Damages.

 



 

(g) Except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in no event shall the aggregate liability of the Holders for
indemnification under this _Article X_ exceed the amount of the Purchase
Price.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification of the Holder Indemnified Parties_. After the
Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_, the
Surviving Company and the Purchaser shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Holder Indemnified Parties, from and against any
and all Damages which may be incurred or suffered by any such Holder
Indemnified Party and arise out of or result from any (i) breach of any
warranty or any inaccuracy of any representation contained in _Article V_ and
(ii) breach of, or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company contained in this Agreement.
Except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct by the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, in no event shall the aggregate liability of either the
Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation or the Purchaser for indemnification under this _Article X_
exceed the amount of the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. A party making a claim for
indemnification under _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ shall be, for the
purposes of this Agreement referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ " and a
party against whom such claims are asserted under _Section 10.1_ or _Section
10.2_ shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement, referred to as an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ". All claims by any Indemnified Party under _Section
10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) In the event that (i) any action, application, suit, demand, claim or
legal, administrative, arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
proceeding, hearing or investigation (each a " _Proceeding_ ") is asserted or
instituted by any Person other than the Parties or their Affiliates which
could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable to
an Indemnified Party under this Agreement (such Proceeding, a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") or (ii) any Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall have a
claim to be indemnified by any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which
does not involve a Third Party Claim (such claim, a " _Direct Claim_ " and,
together with Third Party Claims, " _Indemnification Claims_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall, promptly after it becomes aware of a Third Party
Claim (and in any event, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
date in accordance with _Section 10.6_) or facts supporting a Direct Claim,
send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such
Proceeding or Direct Claim, and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which
amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive) (a " _Claim Notice_ "),
together with copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
served on or received by the Indemnified Party in the case of a Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that a delay in notifying the Indemnifying
Party (or delivering copies of the aforementioned notices and documents) shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 10.1_,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by
such failure to give such notice or deliver such documents or notices, in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations under
_Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ only to the extent of such prejudice.

 



 

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend against and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim but
shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of any material changes with
respect to the Third Party Claim and shall, in good faith, satisfy any
reasonable requests made by the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense
of the Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that to the extent that the
Third Party Claim (i) exclusively relates to business conducted by the Company
or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, (ii) does not have any material
impact on the future business of the Surviving Corporation and (iii) would not
reasonably be expected to seek Damages in excess of an amount equal to 25% of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount in the aggregate with all other related
Third Party Claims, then the

 



      
 

 



 

Holders shall have the right to direct the defense of such Third Party Claim,
whether they are the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnified Party elects to defend against and direct the defense of any Third
Party Claim, it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Third Party Claim so requires) (the " _Dispute Period_ ") notify the
Indemnifying Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnified Party does not
elect within the Dispute Period to defend against and direct the defense of
any Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnifying Party of its
election during the Dispute Period, the Indemnifying Party may defend against
and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
elects to defend against and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim and
appoint counsel in connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party may
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If
reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees
to cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in defending and
contesting any Proceeding which the Indemnified Party defends. No Third Party
Claim may be settled or compromised, or offered to be settled or compromised,
or a default permitted or an entry of any judgment consented to (each, a "
_Settlement_ ") by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a Settlement or arbitration shall
have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
Indemnification Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying
Party shall make prompt payment thereof by wire transfer in immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice
or, if required earlier, pursuant to the terms of the agreement reached with
respect to the Indemnification Claim. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
seek reimbursement for any Damages for which they are entitled to receive
indemnification under this _Article X_ first out of the Escrow Account
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to the extent such funds have
not been exhausted or released; ___provided_ , _however_ , that with respect
to amounts due to a Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Purchaser Indemnified
Party may request in writing that the Indemnifying Party delay making any
payments until immediately prior to the Escrow Release Date and at such time,
cash from the Escrow Account will first be distributed with respect to any
matters limited in amount to the Aggregate Escrow Amount.

 



 

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim Notice whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes such Indemnification Claim; _provided_ _that_
a delay in notifying the Indemnified Party of such objection shall not waive
the Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Partys right to make such objection, except to the extent that (and only to
the extent that) the Indemnified Party shall have been prejudiced by such
failure to give such notice, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.
From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice under this Agreement, at the
reasonable request of either Party, each Party shall grant the other and its
Representatives reasonable access to the books, records, employees,
Representatives and properties of such Party to the extent reasonably related
to the matters to which the Claim Notice relates. All such access shall be
granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under conditions
which will not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such
Party. The Party requesting access will not, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, use (except in
connection with such Claim Notice) or disclose to any third person other than
the Partys Representatives (except as may be required by applicable Law) any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 10.3(d)_ which is designated
as confidential by the other Party.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Limitation of Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the rights
and remedies set forth in _Section 3.10_ (Adjustment of Purchase Price), this
_Article X_, the Escrow Agreement and any Letter of Transmittal shall
constitute the Purchaser Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive rights and
remedies based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether stated as a breach of contract, tort
or otherwise) including in respect of any breach or nonperformance of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All payments made pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.2_ shall be deemed for all purposes,
including federal, state and local Tax and financial accounting purposes to be
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax and all other purposes. All
distributions made to the Holders from the Escrow Account shall be based on
such Holders Pro Rata Percentage.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Survival of Representations and Covenants_. No representation,
or warranty of the Parties contained herein shall survive the Escrow Release
Date; except, that: (i) fraud or willful misconduct and the Specified
Representations (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.14_ (Tax Returns; Taxes)) shall survive indefinitely, and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.14_ (Tax Returns;
Taxes) and any indemnification obligations related to the matters set forth on
Schedule 10.1 shall survive until the date that is 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Further Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the
amount of any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability of any type shall be
included in the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital included
in the Final Balance Sheet, such amount associated with such loss, claim,
damage, expense or liability shall not also constitute Damages under this
_Article X_, nor

 



      
 

 



 

shall the Holders have an obligation under any provision of this Agreement to
pay the amount thereof to the Company or the Purchaser.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate all Damages after becoming aware
of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages
that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in the event that any
Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made
by it herein, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at
law. In the event that any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any
covenant or agreement made by such Party herein, the non-breaching Party or
Parties may, subject to the terms hereof and in addition to any remedy at law
for damages or other relief, institute and prosecute an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performances of such covenant or
agreement or seek any other equitable relief.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Tax Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in
the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Article X_ and the
provisions of _Section 6.12(b)_, the provisions of _Section 6.12(b)_ shall
control.

(b) The Company hereby irrevocably appoints the Stockholder Representative as
its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution

harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without willful
misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative, arising
out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representatives carrying out its
duties under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully
defending the Stockholder Representative against any claim of liability with
respect thereto, and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled, in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Escrow
Agreement, to withdraw funds from the Stockholder Representative Reserve to
satisfy any such loss, liability, or expense so incurred. All such losses,
liabilities or expenses shall be borne exclusively by the Holders. The
Stockholder Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and will
have full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken and
suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such
counsel.

wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), the Company and

Merger dated as of April 26, 2012 (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), pursuant
to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company and the Company will

Closing Date is an amount equal to $[ ], in escrow to provide
a source of funds for the payment of amounts that may become due to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Holders under the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **C**. Section 3.3 of the Merger Agreement provides that, at Closing,
Purchaser will deposit the Working Capital Escrow Amount, which as of the
Closing Date is an amount equal to $[ ], in escrow to provide for the
payment to Purchaser in the event of certain adjustments, if any, to the

with Section 3.10 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **D**. Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Holders) desire, as required under the Merger Agreement, to appoint the Escrow
Agent, as escrow agent pursuant to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent
desires to accept such appointment and to hold, invest, administer and
distribute the escrow funds in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **E.** Pursuant to Section 11.13 of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative has been irrevocably appointed to serve as the Stockholder

defined in the Merger Agreement) for the distribution of proceeds as provided
in such Exchange Agent Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 



 

 **Section 1. ****Receipt of Escrow Funds; Establishment of Escrow Accounts
and Investment of Escrow Funds.**

 



 

 **1.1 Escrow Agent**. Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative hereby
appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent for the Escrow Fund, and the
Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment, all in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **1.2 ****Receipt of Escrow Funds**. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount and
the Escrow Agent agrees to hold, invest, administer and distribute the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount and all
interest thereon (collectively, the " ** _Escrow Fund_** ") in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **1.3 ****Establishment of Escrow Accounts**. The Escrow Agent agrees to
accept delivery of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital
Escrow Amount and agrees to hold the Escrow Funds in a separate account, and
further hold the Working Capital Escrow Amount in a subaccount (the " **
_Working Capital Escrow Account_** ") that is separate and distinct from the
subaccount holding the Indemnification Escrow Amount (the " **
_Indemnification Escrow Account_** "). The balance of the Escrow Funds, which
may be reduced from time to time by distributions made to Purchaser or the
Stockholder Representative in accordance with the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement, are referred to as (i) the " ** _Indemnification Escrow Fund
Balance_** " when referring to the remaining funds on deposit in the
Indemnification Escrow Account at the time of determination, including all
interest accrued thereon; and (ii) the " ** _Working Capital Escrow Fund
Balance_** " when referring to the remaining funds on deposit in the Working
Capital Escrow Account at the time of determination, including all interest
accrued thereon.

 



 

 **1.4 Investment of Escrow Fund**.

 



 

 **(a) **The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Fund consisting of cash only
in one of the investment vehicles described in **Exhibit C** upon the receipt
of joint written instructions from Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative. In the absence of such joint written instructions from
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Fund consisting of
cash only shall be deposited in a U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit Account.

 



 

 **(b) **All earnings received from any investment of the funds in the
Indemnification Escrow Account and the Working Capital Escrow Account shall be
included in, and shall become a part of, the Escrow Fund (and any losses on
such investments shall be deducted from the Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for losses, penalties or charges incurred upon any sale or
purchase of any such investment. The Escrow Agent shall deliver to each of
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, in accordance with the Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agents normal policies and procedures, a written report of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund Balance and the Working Capital Escrow Fund
Balance, as well as the amount of income and earnings accrued with respect
thereto and a statement of security transactions for both the Indemnification
Escrow Account and the Working Capital Escrow Account in its regular monthly
reports.

 



 

 **1.5 ****Transferability**. The interests of the Holders in the Escrow Fund
shall not be assignable or transferable, other than by operation of law. No
assignment or transfer of any of such interests by operation of law shall be
recognized or given effect until Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall have
received written notice of such assignment or transfer.

 



 

 **1.6 ****Trust Fund.** The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any Holder or of any party hereto. The
Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund until the
Indemnification Escrow Release Date (as defined below).

 



 

 **Section 2. Administration of Indemnification Escrow Account.** Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the
Indemnification Escrow Account as follows:

 



 

 **2.1 Claims Against the Indemnification Escrow Account**.

 



 

 **(a) **If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has or claims in good faith to
have incurred or suffered Damages for which it is or may be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article X of the Merger
Agreement, such Purchaser Indemnified Party may deliver a Claim Notice to the
Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall
specify the nature of such Proceeding or Direct Claim, and the amount or
estimated amount thereof (the " ** _Claimed Amount_** "), together with copies
of all notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by
the Purchaser Indemnified Party in the case of a Third Party Claim, provided,
however, that a delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party (or delivering
copies of the aforementioned notices and documents) shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 10.1 of the Merger
Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced by such failure to give such notice or deliver such documents or
notices, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
obligations under Section 10.1 of the Merger Agreement only to the extent of
such prejudice.

 



 

 **(b) **During the twenty (20)-Business Day period commencing upon receipt by
the Stockholder Representative of a Claim Notice from a Purchaser Indemnified
Party (the " ** _Dispute Period_** "), the Stockholder Representative may
deliver to the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent a written
response (the " ** _Response Notice_** ") in which the Stockholder
Representative: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party; or (iii) indicates
that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party.
If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause "(ii)" or
"(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a
brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Stockholder
Representatives claim that

 



      
 

 



 

only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party, as the case may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed to be owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the
Purchaser Indemnified Partys Claim Notice being referred to as the " **
_Contested Amount_** "). If a Response Notice is not received by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent from the Stockholder Representative
prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Stockholder
Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount
equal to the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 



 

 **2.2 Distribution of Indemnification Escrow Fund**.

 



 

 **(a) **If the Stockholder Representative in his Response Notice agrees that
the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, or if no
Response Notice is received by the Purchaser Indemnified Party from the
Stockholder Representative prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then
the Escrow Agent shall release an amount equal to the Claimed Amount from the
Escrow Fund to Purchaser within one (1) Business Day following the earlier of
the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period.

 



 

 **(b) **If the Stockholder Representative in the Response Notice agrees that
part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party (the " ** _Agreed Amount_** "), then the Escrow Agent shall release an
amount equal to the Agreed Amount from the Escrow Fund to Purchaser within one
(1) Business Day following the delivery of such Response Notice.

 



 

 **(c) **If any Response Notice expressly indicates that there is a Contested
Amount, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested
Amount. If the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser Indemnified Party
resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the Holders and such
Purchaser Indemnified Party and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount
owed to such Purchaser Indemnified Party (the " ** _Stipulated Amount_** ")
shall be signed by such Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative. The Escrow Agent shall release an amount equal to the
Stipulated Amount from the Indemnification Escrow Account to Purchaser within
one (1) Business Day following the execution of such settlement agreement.

 



 

 **(d) **The Escrow Agent shall release from the Indemnification Escrow
Account an amount in connection with any Contested Amount within one (1)
Business Day after the delivery to it of a copy of a settlement agreement
executed by the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative
setting forth instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the amount, if any, to be
released from the Escrow Account, with respect to such Contested Amount.

 



 

 **(e) **Any amount released from the Escrow Account shall be deemed to reduce
the Escrow Fund pro rata with respect to each applicable Closing Common
Stockholder in accordance with each Closing Common Stockholders percentage
interest in the Escrow Fund as set forth on **Exhibit A**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 3. Release of Indemnification Escrow Fund Balance.**

 



 

 **3.1 **At any time during the term of this Agreement, within one (1)
Business Day after receiving joint written instructions from Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall release or cause to be released from the Escrow
Fund, in the amounts and to the persons and in the manner set forth in such
joint written instructions.

 



 

 **3.2 **On the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the
" ** _Indemnification Escrow Release Date_** "), the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of the Closing Common
Stockholders, the remainder of the Indemnification Escrow Fund Balance, if
any; _provided, however_ , that if prior to the Indemnification Escrow Release
Date, any Purchaser Indemnified Party has given a Claim Notice containing a
claim which has not been resolved prior to the Indemnification Escrow Release
Date in accordance with Section 2, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the
Indemnification Escrow Account after the Indemnification Escrow Release Date
an amount equal to the Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as the case may be,
with respect to all claims which have not then been resolved. Upon a joint
written instruction from Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative that a
judgment, order or decree has been entered or made by any court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the disposition of the Escrow Fund that is not
subject to further appeal or modification before compliance is required
herewith, the Escrow Agent shall comply with such judgment, order or decree.

 



 

 **3.3 **Distributions of the Escrow Fund owed to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be made to Purchaser by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser and
distributions owed to the Closing Common Stockholders shall be made to the
Exchange Agent (for further distribution to the Closing Common Stockholders)
by check to the addresses set forth on **Exhibit A **or by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Closing Common Stockholders.

 



 

 **Section 4. Administration of the Working Capital Escrow Account. **Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the Working
Capital Escrow Account as follows:

 



 

 **4.1 **if there is a Working Capital Surplus reflected on the Final Balance
Sheet, then within five (5) Business Days after Purchasers delivery of the
Final Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative (or, if the Stockholder
Representative has objected to such Final Balance Sheet, the date of
determination of the Final Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 3.10(e) of the
Merger Agreement), (a) Purchaser shall deliver the Working Capital Surplus in
immediately available funds by wire transfer or check to the Exchange Agent
for distribution to the Closing Common Stockholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages and (b) Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately deliver to the
Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Closing Common Stockholders in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages, the Working Capital Escrow Fund
Balance in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check; or

 



 

 **4.2 **if there is a Working Capital Deficit reflected on the Final Balance
Sheet then:

 



 

 **(a) **if the Working Capital Deficit is less than the Working Capital
Escrow Fund Balance, within five (5) Business Days after Purchasers delivery
of the Final Balance Sheet to the Stockholder Representative, Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver, in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check from the
Working Capital Escrow Account: (i) first, to Purchaser, the Working Capital
Deficit; and (ii) then to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Holders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages, the amount equal to the
difference between the Working Capital Escrow Fund Balance minus the Working
Capital Deficit; or

 



 

 **(b) **if the Working Capital Deficit is equal to or greater than the
Working Capital Escrow Fund Balance, within five (5) Business Days after
Purchasers delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to the Stockholder
Representative, Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser the Working Capital Escrow
Fund Balance, in immediately available funds by wire transfer or check from
the Working Capital Escrow Account.

 



 

 **Section 5. Fees and Expenses.**

 



 

 **5.1 **The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive from time to time fees
in accordance with **Exhibit B**. In accordance with **Exhibit B**, the
Escrow Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in the
performance of its duties hereunder and the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. Purchaser agrees to pay all of the fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent and any such fees due to the Escrow Agent by Purchaser shall be paid by
Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the Escrow
Agent detailing such fees and expenses.

 



 

 **Section 6. Limitation of Escrow Agents Liability.**

 



 

 **6.1 **The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement only and shall have no duty under any
other agreement or document, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
incur no liability with respect to any action taken by it or for any inaction
on its part in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except for its own
negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable
for incidental, punitive or consequential damages.

 



 

 **6.2 **Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (acting on behalf of the
Holders) hereby severally (each to the extent of 50%) but not jointly agree to
indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents
for, and hold it and them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense
incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agent carrying out its
duties hereunder. This right of indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and the
resignation of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **Section 7. Termination.** This Agreement shall terminate on the
Indemnification Escrow Release Date or, if earlier, upon the release by the
Escrow Agent of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement _;_
_provided, however,_ that if the Escrow Agent has received from any Purchaser
Indemnified Party a Claim Notice setting forth a claim that has not been
resolved by the Indemnification Escrow Release Date, then this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the claim has been resolved and the
Escrow Fund released in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 8. Successor Escrow Agent.** In the event the Escrow Agent becomes
unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement.
Such resignation shall take effect not less than thirty (30) days after it is
given to all parties hereto. In such event, Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative shall agree upon and appoint a successor Escrow Agent. If
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative fail to appoint a successor
Escrow Agent within fifteen (15) days after receiving the Escrow Agents
written resignation, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. The
successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an
instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor Escrow Agent shall,
without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers
and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow
Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with joint written
instructions from Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative as to the
transfer of the Escrow Fund to a successor escrow agent.

 



 

 **Section 9. Miscellaneous.**

 



 

 **9.1 Attorneys Fees _._** If any legal action or other legal proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this

 **(a) **No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

 



 

 **(b) **No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of

unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is

delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that
any amendment executed and delivered by the Stockholder Representative shall
be deemed to have been approved by and duly executed and delivered by all of
the Holders.

 



 

 **9.10 Severability _. _**Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or

competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the

 



      
 

 



 

parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.

the provisions of this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to provide
any rights or remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, if any.

 **(a) **The parties hereto agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all
interest on or other income, if any, attributable to the Escrow Fund or any

income earned from, the investment of the Escrow Fund, respectively, pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

 **(b) **Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of each of
the Holders) agree to provide the Escrow Agent with certified tax
identification numbers for each of Purchaser and the Closing Common
Stockholders by furnishing appropriate forms W-9 (or Forms W-8, in the case of
non-U.S. persons) and any other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request (collectively, " ** _Tax Reporting Documentation_** ") to
the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days after the date hereof. The parties
hereto understand that, if such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so
furnished to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be required by the Code
to withhold a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment
of monies held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement, and to
immediately remit such withholding to the Internal Revenue Service.

with each other party and to execute and deliver such further documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may
be reasonably requested by such other party or parties to evidence or reflect

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

In connection with the closing of the Merger, the undersigned (or, if two or
more persons have signed this Letter of Transmittal as the registered holders
of a certificate, each of the undersigned), the registered holder of the
certificate or certificates described below of MedPak stock (the "Surrendered
Certificate(s)"), or the transferee or assignee of such registered holder,
hereby irrevocably surrenders the Surrendered Certificate(s) in exchange for
(a) a check or wire transfer to the account specified by the undersigned in
this Letter of Transmittal representing a portion of the merger consideration
payable pursuant to Section 3.6 of the Merger Agreement (subject to the
portion of such merger consideration that will be held in escrow in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement), and (b) any portion of the merger
consideration that is placed into escrow on behalf of the undersigned that is
thereafter released to the undersigned, in each case in respect of the shares
of MedPak stock formerly represented by the Surrendered Certificate(s) (the
cash consideration payable to the undersigned in connection with the Merger
(including, if applicable, any amount that is released from escrow) being
referred to as the "Payment"). The undersigned hereby instructs the Exchange
Agent to exchange the Surrendered Certificates for cash in respect of each
share of MedPak stock held by it.

 



 

The name(s) and address of the registered holder(s), as they appear on the
Surrendered Certificate(s), are printed under "Description of Surrendered
Certificate(s)." The number(s) of the Surrendered Certificate(s) are indicated
in the appropriate boxes.

 



 

The undersigned (or, if applicable, each of the undersigned) hereby represents
and warrants that he, she or it (i) is the true and lawful owner of, and has
legal and valid title to, the Surrendered Certificate(s), free and clear of
any liens, claims or encumbrances, and (ii) has full capacity, power and
authority to execute and deliver this Letter of Transmittal and to surrender
the Surrendered Certificate(s) for exchange as specified above. The
undersigned (or, if applicable, each of the undersigned) (x) acknowledges
having received a copy of the Merger Agreement from MedPak, (y) agrees to be
bound by the indemnification provisions and the escrow provisions set forth in
Article X of the Merger Agreement and the provisions of the Escrow Agreement
(as defined in the Merger Agreement), and (z) approves the appointment of and
hereby appoints the Stockholder Representative (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) (or its successor as appointed pursuant to the Merger Agreement) as
the representative of the undersigned and as the attorney-in-fact and agent
for and on behalf of the undersigned with respect to the Merger Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, and the taking by such representative of any and all
actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by
the representative under the Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 11.13
thereof or under the Escrow Agreement. The undersigned (or, if applicable,
each of the undersigned) further agrees, upon the reasonable request of
Omnicell, the Stockholder Representative or the Exchange Agent, to execute any
additional documents necessary or desirable to perfect the surrender of the
Surrendered Certificate(s), to permit the completion of the exchange, or both.
Effective upon the completion of the Merger, the undersigned (or, if
applicable, each of the undersigned) surrenders to Omnicell all right, title
and interest in and to the shares of Medpak stock formerly represented by the
Surrendered Certificate(s). All authority herein conferred or agreed to be
conferred in this Letter of Transmittal shall survive the death, dissolution
or incapacity of the undersigned and any obligations of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the undersigned.

 



 

By delivery of this Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, the
undersigned hereby (i) forever waives all appraisal rights under applicable
Delaware law and (ii) withdraws all objections (if any), whether or not
written, to the Merger and/or demands for appraisal (if any) with respect to
any shares of MedPak stock held by the undersigned.

 



 

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned
contained in this Letter of Transmittal shall survive the delivery by the
Exchange Agent of the Payment to the undersigned and are in addition to any
other representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the
undersigned, including any such representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

The undersigned understands that the surrender of the Surrendered
Certificate(s) will not be deemed to have been made in acceptable form until
receipt by the Exchange Agent of this Letter of Transmittal, or a reproduction

 



      
 

 



 

hereof, duly completed and signed, together with all requisite evidence of
authority in form reasonably satisfactory to Omnicell (which may delegate
power in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent). All questions as to
validity, form and eligibility of a surrender of Surrendered Certificate(s)
hereunder will be determined by Omnicell (which may delegate power in whole or
in part to the Exchange Agent) and such determination shall be final and
binding upon the undersigned.

 



 

Unless the undersigned indicates otherwise under "Special Issuance
Instructions," the Payment will be made payable to the registered holder(s)
appearing under "Description of Surrendered Certificates." Similarly, unless
otherwise indicated herein under "Special Delivery Instructions," the Payment
will be mailed to the address of the registered holder(s) appearing under
"Description of Surrendered Certificates" or delivered by wire transfer to the
account specified by the undersigned in this Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

The undersigned shall timely pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other taxes and charges arising from or relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the undersigned shall,
at his, her or its own expense, file all necessary tax returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, and other taxes and charges.

 **INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL**

 



 

 **1. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and ****Surrendered**
**Certificates.** The Surrendered Certificate(s), as well as the properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documents
required by this Letter of Transmittal, must be received by the Exchange Agent
for delivery to be effected and the appropriate person to be entitled to
receive the consideration set forth in Section 3.6 of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, such consideration will be
delivered in exchange for Surrendered Certificate(s) surrendered pursuant to
the Merger in all cases only after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the
Surrendered Certificate(s), a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and all other required documents. If a certificate has been lost
or destroyed, such fact should be indicated in this Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of the
Surrendered Certificate(s) hereunder or delivery by the holder(s) of this
Letter of Transmittal shall be determined by Omnicell. Omnicell also reserves
the right to waive any defect or irregularity in the surrender of any
Surrendered Certificate or delivery of any Letter of Transmittal, and its
interpretations of other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this
Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to such
irregularities or defects shall be final and binding.

 



 

The method of delivery of the Surrendered Certificate(s) and all other
required documents is at the election of the surrendering holder(s), but risk
of loss and title to the Surrendered Certificate(s) will pass only upon
delivery of the Surrendered Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent. If delivery
is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured,
is recommended.

 



 

 **2. Guarantee of Signatures.** No signature on this Letter of Transmittal is
required to be guaranteed if (i) this Letter of Transmittal (or a reproduction
thereof) is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Surrendered
Certificate(s) and the signature(s) correspond exactly with the name(s) as
written on the face(s) of the Surrendered Certificate(s), _unless_ such
holder(s) have completed the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or
the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions," or (ii) the Surrendered
Certificate(s) are tendered for the account of a firm that is a member of a
registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. or by a commercial bank or trust company having an
office or correspondent in the United States (each of the foregoing firms,
banks and trust companies being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"). In

alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a correction of name or for a change in

 **9. Substitute Form W-9; Form W-8.** Under federal income tax laws, each
holder surrendering a Surrendered Certificate is required to provide the
Exchange Agent with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on
Substitute Form W-9, which is provided under "Important Tax Information," and
to indicate if such holder is not subject to backup withholding by signing and
dating the Substitute Form W-9. Failure to provide the information on the form
may subject the surrendering holder(s) to a $50 penalty imposed by the
Internal Revenue Service and the Payment will be subject to backup withholding
taxes of 28%. See "Important Tax Information" below. **Please consult your
accountant or tax advisor for further guidance in completing the Substitute
Form W-9. **A non-U.S. holder that certifies its non-U.S. status by
completing an appropriate IRS Form W-8 will not be subject to backup
withholding and will not need to complete a Form W-9. Non-U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate Form W-8 (which can be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service web site at http://www.irs.gov) and
any other forms that may be required.

 



 

 **10. Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.** If any certificate
representing shares of MedPak stock has been lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen, the holder should promptly notify the Exchange Agent, attention: Chris
Cartier, at the address set forth on the first page of this Letter of
Transmittal. The holder will then be instructed as to the steps that must be
taken in order to replace such certificate. A completed Letter of Transmittal
and any related documents should accompany the written notice of a lost,
mutilated, destroyed or stolen MedPak stock certificate; however, it cannot be
processed until the procedures for replacing the lost, mutilated, destroyed or
stolen certificate have been followed.

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

Under federal income tax law, a holder who is a "United States Person" for
United States federal income tax purposes surrendering any Certificate(s) is
required to provide Omnicell, Inc. ("Omnicell") with such holders correct
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the Substitute Form W-9 provided
herein. For United States federal income tax purposes, you are considered a
"United States Person" if you are (1) an individual who is a United States
citizen or a United States resident alien, (2) a partnership, corporation,
company or association created or organized in the United States or under the
laws of the United States, (3) an estate (other than a foreign estate), or (4)
a domestic trust (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-7). If
such holder is an individual, the TIN is the holders social security number.
The "Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number" within the
Substitute Form W-9 should be completed if the holder has not been issued a
TIN and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near
future. If the holder does not furnish the Exchange Agent with a Substitute
Form W-9 (or an applicable substitute form) that contains the holders correct
TIN, the holder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service, and any payments of cash to such holder may be subject to
backup withholding at the rate of 28%. Certain holders (including, among
others, corporations and generally foreign holders) are not subject to backup
withholding. In order for a foreign holder to qualify for exemption from
backup withholding, that holder must properly complete and furnish an
applicable Form W-8 or substitute form, signed under penalties of perjury,
attesting to such holders foreign status. Such forms can be obtained from the
Exchange Agent at the address set forth on the first page of this Letter of
Transmittal, attention: Chris Cartier, or by telephone at 651-495-2366.

 



 

If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent is required to withhold 28%
of any payments of cash to the holder. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding may be
reduced or credited by the amount of tax withheld, if the required information
is provided to the IRS. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a
refund may be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service. See the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 for additional information.

 



 

If you are not a holder who is a "United States Person" as defined above, you
must complete the appropriate Form W-8. Form W-8s are available at the IRS
website (www.IRS.gov). A non-United States Persons failure to complete the
appropriate Form W-8 will subject the recipient to the applicable federal
income tax withholding from any cash payment made to them pursuant to the
exchange.

 



 

 **Please consult your accountant or tax advisor for further guidance 
in completing the Substitute Form W-9 or Form W-8.**

 



 

 **Purpose of Substitute Form W-9**

 



 

To prevent backup withholding on cash payments that are made to a holder with
respect to Certificate(s) surrendered for payment, the holder is required to
notify the Exchange Agent of his or her current TIN by completing the form
below certifying that the TIN provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or
that such holder is awaiting a TIN) and that (i) such holder has not been
notified by the Internal Revenue Service that he or she is subject to backup
withholding as a result of failure to report all interest or dividends or (ii)
the Internal Revenue Service has notified such holder that he or she is no
longer subject to backup withholding.

 



 

 **What Number to Give**

 



 

Each holder is required to give the Exchange Agent the social security number
or employer identification number of the record holder(s) of the
Certificate(s). If a Certificate is in more than one name or is not in the
name of the actual holder, consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification
of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for guidance on which
number to report.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number**

 



 

If the surrendering holder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a
number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, write "Applied
For" in the space for the TIN on Substitute Form W-9, sign and date the
"Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number" within the Substitute
Form W-9 and return the form to the Exchange Agent. If such certificate is
completed and the Exchange Agent is not provided with the TIN within 60 days,
the Exchange Agent will withhold 28% of all payments made thereafter until a
TIN is so provided.

(1) the number shown on this form is my correct Taxpayer Identification Number

from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of
a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me
that I am no longer subject to backup withholding, and

 

(3) I am a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien) **.**

 

 ** **

 

 **Certification Instructions**  You must cross out Item (2) above if you
have been notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding
because you have failed to report all interest or dividends on your tax
return. However, if after being notified by the IRS that you were subject to
backup withholding you received another notification from the IRS that you are
no longer subject to backup withholding, do not cross out Item (2). Item (2)
does not apply for real estate transactions. For mortgage interest paid,
acquisition or abandonment of secured property, contributions to an individual
retirement account, and generally, payments other than interest and dividends,
you are not required to sign this Certification, but you must provide your
correct Taxpayer Identification Number. Also see "Signing the Certification"
under "Specific Instructions" in the enclosed Guidelines.

 **NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9, Cont.**

 



 

Exempt payees described above should file the Substitute Form W-9 to avoid
possible erroneous backup withholding. IF YOU ARE AN EXEMPT PAYEE DESCRIBED
ABOVE, COMPLETE, SIGN, AND DATE THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9, WRITE "EXEMPT" ON THE
FACE OF THE FORM, AND RETURN THE FORM TO THE PAYOR.

 



 

Certain payments other than interest, dividends and patronage dividends not
subject to information reporting are not subject to backup withholding. For
details, see the regulations under Internal Revenue Code sections 6041, 6041A,
6042, 6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A and 6050N.

 



 

 **Privacy Act Notice.**  Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires
you to give your correct TIN to persons who must file information returns with
the IRS to report, among other things, interest, dividends, and certain other
income paid to you. The IRS uses the numbers for identification purposes and
to help verify the accuracy of your tax return. The IRS may also provide this
information to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation,
and to cities, states and the District of Columbia to carry out their tax
laws. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax
return. A Payor must generally withhold 28% of taxable interest, dividend and
certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the Payor.
Certain penalties may also apply.

 



 

 **Penalties**

 



 

(1) **Penalty for Failure to Furnish TIN. **If you fail to furnish your TIN
to the Payor, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure,
unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

 

(2) **Failure to Report Certain Dividend and Interest Payments. **If you
fail to include any portion of an includible payment for interest, dividends
or patronage dividends in gross income, such failure will be treated as being
due to negligence and will be subject to a penalty of 20% on any portion of an
under-payment attributable to that failure unless there is clear and
convincing evidence to the contrary.

 

(3) **Civil and Criminal Penalties for False Information. **If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition of
backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty. Falsifying
certifications or affirmations may also subject you to criminal penalties
including fines and/or imprisonment.

 **FORM OF NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **THIS NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT** (the " ** _Noncompetition Agreement_** ")
is being executed and delivered as of [ ], 2012, by [ **
] **(" ** _Individual_** "), in favor of, and for the benefit of: **OMNICELL,
INC.**, a Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), and the other
Beneficiaries. Certain capitalized terms used in this Noncompetition Agreement
are defined in Section 16.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **A.** Individual is a security holder and/or a key employee of MTS
Medication Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Company_**
"), and has obtained and developed extensive and valuable knowledge, trade
secrets, and confidential information concerning the business of the Company
and its Affiliates.

 



 

 **B.** Individual, in the course of operating the business of the Company,
has also developed on behalf of the Company and its Affiliates significant
goodwill, including without limitation substantial relationships with
customers and prospective customers, that is now a significant part of the
value of the Company and its Affiliates. This goodwill extends throughout
Companys marketing and business area in all geographic locations in which the
Company has a presence and/or conducts business.

 



 

 **C.** Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of April [ ], 2012 (the " ** _Merger
Agreement_** "), by and among Parent, MedPak Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, Mercury Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), and Excellere Capital
Management, LLC, as the Stockholders Representative, Parent, the Company and
Merger Sub intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company, pursuant
to which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

 **D.** Parent wishes to protect its investment in the assets, business,
customer relationships and other goodwill of the Company pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, including the trade secrets, confidential and proprietary
information possessed by Individual, by restricting the activities of
Individual which might compete with or harm such assets, business, customer
relationships or goodwill.

 



 

 **F.** In connection with, and as a condition to the consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and to enable Parent to
secure more fully the benefits of such transactions, Parent has required that
Individual enter into this Noncompetition Agreement; and Individual is
entering into this Noncompetition Agreement in order to induce Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Individual agrees as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 **1.** ** ****NONCOMPETITION**. During the Noncompetition Period, Individual
shall not, directly or indirectly, alone or as a partner, founder, joint
venturer, officer, director, employee, consultant, agent, independent
contractor or shareholder of any company or business, whether now or hereafter
existing: (i) engage in or facilitate any Competition within any geographic
location in which the Company does business, maintains an office, or maintains
a customer as of the latest day of the Individuals employment; or (ii)
compete with, or facilitate competition with, the business of [Parent or](1)
the Company in which Individual is engaged during the term of his employment.
Individual acknowledges that this covenant will not impair him from becoming
gainfully employed, or otherwise earning a livelihood following termination of
employment with the Company or Parent. Individual further acknowledges that if
a court of competent jurisdiction finds this noncompetition provision invalid
or unenforceable due to unreasonableness in time, geographic scope or scope of
the Companys business, then such court will interpret and enforce this
provision to the maximum extent that such court deems reasonable.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Individuals ownership of not more than
one percent (1%) of the shares of stock of any corporation having a class of
equity securities actively traded on a national securities exchange shall not
be deemed to violate the prohibitions of this paragraph. Individual further
acknowledges that the geographical scope of these limitations is reasonable
and necessary for the protection of the Companys trade secrets, other
Confidential Information and goodwill.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****CONFIDENTIALITY**. The Individual agrees that he shall hold all
Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not at any time
(whether during or after the Noncompetition Period): (a) reveal, report,
publish, disclose or transfer any Confidential Information to any Person
(other than the Parent or the Company), except in the performance of his
obligations as an employee of the Company or Parent; (b) use any Confidential
Information for any purpose, except in the performance of his obligations as
an employee of the Company or Parent; or (c) use any Confidential Information
for the benefit of any Person (other than the Parent or the Company). This
Noncompetition Agreement shall not prohibit Individual from complying with any
subpoena or court order, provided that Individual shall at the earliest
practicable date provide a copy of the subpoena or court order to Company, in
each case to the attention of: General Counsel, Omnicell, Inc., 1201
Charleston Road, Mountain View, CA 94043, it being the parties intention to
give the Company a fair opportunity to take appropriate steps to prevent the
unnecessary and/or improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information, as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****NON-SOLICITATION**. Individual agrees that any attempt on his
part to induce others to leave the Companys employ, or any effort by
Individual to interfere with the Companys relationship with its other
employees, independent contractors, vendors, clients, customers or prospective
customers, may harm or damage the Company. Therefore, Individual agrees that
during the Noncompetition Period, Individual will not in any way, directly or
indirectly, on Individuals own behalf or on behalf of any third party, alone
or in association with others:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **(i) interfere with, impair, disrupt or damage the Companys
relationship with any of its customers or (to the extent then known to
Individual) identified customer prospects with whom the Company has an
established connection to develop the prospective relationship

  (1) Parent only to be included to the extent that the Individual is an
employee of or consultant to the Company following the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(" ** _Prospective Customers_** "), (ii) solicit or encourage others to
solicit any of the Companys customers or Prospective Customers for the
purpose of acquiring business from them if such business is engaged in
Competition, (iii) accept business from any of the Companys customers or
Prospective Customers if such business is engaged in Competition, or (iv)
otherwise divert or take away from the Company some or all of the business of
any of the Companys customers or Prospective Customers;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **recruit or solicit, or encourage or facilitate any other
company, business organization or person to recruit or solicit, any person who
is employed by the Company at the time such recruitment, solicitation,
encouragement, or facilitation takes place, or in any manner otherwise seek to
induce any such person to leave his or her employment with the Company; or

 



 

 **(c)** ** **induce or attempt to induce any independent contractor,
consultant, supplier or vendor to terminate its relationship with the Company,
or otherwise interfere with, impair, disrupt or damage the Companys
relationship with any such independent contractor, consultant, supplier or
vendor.

 



 

 **4.** ** ****REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. **Individual represents and
warrants, to and for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, that: (a) he has full
power and capacity to execute and deliver, and to perform all of his
obligations under, this Noncompetition Agreement; (b) neither the execution
and delivery of this Noncompetition Agreement nor the performance of this
Noncompetition Agreement will result in a violation or breach of: (i) any
agreement or obligation by which Individual or any of his Affiliates is or may
be bound; or (ii) any law, rule or regulation; and (c) the restrictions
imposed upon Individual under this Noncompetition Agreement are reasonable.
The Individuals representations and warranties shall survive the expiration
of the Noncompetition Period for an unlimited period of time.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.** The rights and
remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The
parties to this Noncompetition Agreement agree that, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any party to this Noncompetition Agreement of
any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in this Noncompetition
Agreement for the benefit of any other party to this Noncompetition Agreement,
such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it) to seek (a) a decree or order of specific performance or
mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant,
obligation or other provision, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach
or threatened breach. Nothing in this Noncompetition Agreement shall limit any
of the rights or remedies of Parent or any of the other Beneficiaries under
the Merger Agreement; and nothing in the Merger Agreement shall limit any of
Individuals obligations, or any of the rights or remedies of Parent or any of
the other Beneficiaries, under this Noncompetition Agreement. No breach on the
part of Parent or any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in
the Merger Agreement or any other agreement shall limit or otherwise affect
any right or remedy of Parent or any of the other Beneficiaries under this
Noncompetition Agreement. Individual further agrees that no Beneficiary shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 6, and Individual irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
any Beneficiary to obtain, furnish or post any such bond or similar
instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.** ** ****SEVERABILITY.** Any term or provision of this Noncompetition
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Noncompetition Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 **(a)** ** **No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Noncompetition Agreement, and no delay
on the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Noncompetition Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power,
right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such
power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out
of this Noncompetition Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Noncompetition Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,

executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.
