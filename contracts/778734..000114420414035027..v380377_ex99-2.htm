will require the approval by the Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless Buyer waives this provision,

accounts, documents and records which are relevant to such Third Party Claim
and are within the power, possession or control of the Buyer or any of the
Group Companies ("relevant material") to enable the Seller and its duly

   | 11.3| Post-closing take-out of MandA insurance  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Parties agree to use their best endeavours to establish an arrangement
within 15 June 2014 in which (a) 80% of the Escrow Amount shall be released
and paid out to the Seller against simultaneous (b) take-out of a buy-side
MandA insurance providing insurance coverage, mutually acceptable to the Buyer
and the Seller, for the benefit of the Buyer for any Loss resulting from a
breach of the Seller's representation and warranties under Clause 6 of this
Agreement, the reasonable premium of which shall be paid by the Seller
including the insurer's underwriting fees. 50% of the insurer's due diligence
expenses after the Closing Date, if any, shall be covered by the Seller
limited upwards to a total amount of NOK 300,000, while the remaining portion
of such expenses shall be covered by the Buyer. The Seller shall, for the
avoidance of doubt, not cover any other expenses in relation to due diligence
investigations required for take-out of such insurance. With effect from the
implementation of the aforementioned arrangement, the Buyer shall make any
claim for compensation for Loss resulting from breach of the representation
and warranties set out in Clause 6 of this Agreement under such MandA
insurance and shall have no right to make any such claim against the Seller,

or fraud by Seller. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on any
required amendments to this Agreement in connection therewith.

paragraph of this clause within the applicable deadline, the Seller shall have
the right to appoint a reputable Norwegian law firm as new escrow agent of

Escrow Agreement. Such new escrow agent may not be a law firm engaged by
Norvestor Equity AS or any of the portfolio companies of the funds advised
by Norvestor Equity AS the two years preceding the Closing Date. The Parties
agree to make the necessary amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement to give effect to the aforementioned provision.
