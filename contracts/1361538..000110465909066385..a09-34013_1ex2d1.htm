at or after the Closing, as the case may be, and in the manner as further

## 

  

### (a) _Buyer Stock_. At the Closing, Buyer will issue to Sellers a number
of shares of Preferred Stock (the " _Closing Shares_ ") equal to (i) Sixty-
Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($64,500,000) divided by the
Closing Stock Price, and then divided by 100 ** __** minus (ii) the
Escrow Shares. The Closing Shares shall be allocated among the Sellers in
accordance with _Exhibit H_ attached hereto. The term "Closing

### 

  

### (b) _Note_. At the Closing, Buyer will issue a promissory note in the
form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Note_ ") in the principal amount
of Fifty-Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($53,500,000). The

_Exhibit I_ attached hereto.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Earnout_. As part of the Purchase Price, Buyer shall issue shares of
Buyer Common Stock, as and to the extent, if any, provided in accordance with

### 

  

### Million Two Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand Dollars ($10,255,000) (the " _41%
Distribution_ "), if any, less the amount of the September Distributions **
__** (the " _Estimated Second Half Distribution Amount_ "). Upon completion
of financial statements of Target for the period from January 1, 2009 to the

Closing Date (the " _Second Half Earnings Period_ "), Buyer shall provide
Sellers with its calculation of the amount equal to (i) the 45% Distribution
_plus_ (ii) the 41% Distribution, if any, less the amount of the September
Distributions (the " _Calculated Second Half Distribution Amount_ "). Buyer

the amount by which the Actual Second Half Distribution Amount exceeds the
Estimated Second Half Distribution Amount, or (b) Sellers shall each refund
to Target their share, in accordance with _Exhibit A_ attached hereto, of
the amount by which the Estimated Second Half Distribution Amount exceeds the
Actual Second Half Distribution Amount. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the financial statements of Target completed by

### 

  

## 2.3 _Earnout_.

  

## 

  

### (a) If EBITDA for Target operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 is equal to or greater than

accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (the " _Earnout Shares_ ") equal to
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) divided by the Earnout Stock Price. In no
event, however, shall the aggregate number of Earnout Shares exceed 19.9% of
the Buyers outstanding common shares. In such event the aforesaid 19.9%
would limit the amount of Earnout otherwise payable to Sellers, such dollar
amount of Earnout above the 19.9% which Sellers would otherwise receive in
Earnout Shares shall be payable in cash to Sellers. No fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof any fractional
Earnout Shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Earnout Share.

  

### 

  

### (b) Within five (5) days following receipt by Buyer of its audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, but in no
event later than April 15, 2011, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers
Representative, a report (the " _EBITDA Report_ ") showing the computation of
EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. The EBITDA Report shall
be based upon the December 31, 2010 audited financial statements of Target.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer shall issue the Earnout Shares to Sellers within five (5)
Business Days after final determination of EBITDA for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2010. The final determination of EBITDA shall be accomplished in
accordance with subsections (d), (e) and (f) below.

  

### 

  

### (d) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of the EBITDA
Report, Buyer shall permit Sellers and Sellers accountants, upon reasonable
notice at a mutually agreed upon time during normal business hours, to have
full access to the books, records,

  

### 

  

### 14   

     
   

  

### 

  

### accountants and personnel of Buyer and to make such inspections and
copies of such books and records as they may reasonably request, from time to
time to verify the amounts included in the EBITDA Report. Any such EBITDA
Report shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the thirtieth
(30th) day following delivery thereof, unless Sellers Representative shall
have given written notice of disagreement (an " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ "),
to Buyer prior to such date. Any Earn-Out Dispute Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. During the
twenty (20) day period following the delivery of an Earn-Out Dispute Notice,
Sellers Representative and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in such
Earn-Out Dispute Notice.

  

### 

  

### (e) If, at the end of such twenty (20) day period, Sellers
Representative and Buyer have not so resolved such differences, Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall submit the dispute for resolution to PKF Texas
in the Houston, Texas office (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for
review and resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in such Earn-Out Dispute Notice. Each of Buyer,
Target and Sellers hereby represents and warrants to the other that it has no
relationship with the Independent Accounting Firm.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Independent Accounting Firm shall be engaged by Sellers
Representative and Buyer within ten (10) days following the expiration of
such twenty (20) day period. Promptly, but not later than twenty (20)
days after acceptance of this appointment, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine those items in dispute and will render its report as to
its resolution of such terms and resulting calculations of EBITDA for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. In determining each disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to such item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than
the lowest value for such term claimed by either party. Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm
in making its determination and such determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. The losing party (as defined below) in any such
arbitration shall pay all costs and fees (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) related to such determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm, including without limitation, the costs relating
to any negotiations with the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the
terms and conditions of such Independent Accounting Firms engagement.  For
purposes of this _Section 2.3_, as between Sellers Representative and
Buyer, the "losing party" in any such determination shall mean the party
whose EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 (as set forth in
the EBITDA Report, in the case of Buyer, or in an Earn Out Dispute Notice, in
the case of Sellers Representative), is farthest from the calculation of
EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm.

  

### 

  

### (g) Buyer shall have no right to offset the Earnout Shares against any
sum that may be due or is alleged to be due by Sellers to Buyer or the
Acquired Companies.

  

### 

  

## 2.4 _Escrow Shares_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Escrow Shares shall be used by Buyer to satisfy Damages which are
subject to Sellers indemnification to Buyer under _Section 8.2_. Following
the procedures of _Section 8.5_, all Indemnity Claims received and resolved
in accordance with _Section 8.5_ prior to

  

### 

  

### 15   

     
   

  

### 

  

### the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Termination
Date_ ") shall reduce the Escrow Shares then retained by Buyer by an amount
equal to the amount paid or otherwise incurred by Buyer, including all
expenses incurred as defined in _Section 8.5_, _divided by_  the Indemnity
Stock Price and, if the Preferred Stock has not been converted as of that
time, then divided by 100. Buyer shall not be able to reclaim Escrow Shares
once released to Sellers even if there are not enough remaining Escrow Shares
to satisfy the Indemnity Claim. The Escrow Shares shall be allocated among
the Sellers in the percentages set forth on _Exhibit A_, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement to be entered into at
the Closing between Buyer, the Sellers Representative appointed pursuant to
_Section 9.19_ and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company ("
_Continental_ "), as Escrow Agent, in the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit J_
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer will promptly notify Sellers Representative in writing if
Buyer desires to deduct any Escrow Shares (a " _Claim Notice_ "). If the
Sellers Representative fails to give a written objection as to a Claim
Notice to Buyer within thirty (30) days after that Claim Notice is given to
Sellers Representative, Buyer may pay the Indemnity Claim and reduce the
Escrow Shares pursuant to subsection (a) above.  If Sellers Representative
timely objects in writing, Buyer will not pay the Claim or be entitled to
reduce the Escrow Shares for that purpose until a resolution is reached by
Buyer and Sellers Representative in accordance with the procedure set forth
in _Article 8_. If Sellers Representative and Buyer are unable to agree as
to the payment of any Claim pursuant to _Article 8,_ Sellers Representative
and Buyer shall each have the right to arbitrate the resolution of the
disputed Indemnity Claim.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Issuance of Escrow Shares_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Completion of 2010 Audit_. Within five (5) days following receipt
by Buyer of its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2010, but in no event later than April 15, 2011, Continental
will release to Sellers in accordance with the allocations in  _Exhibit H_
attached hereto a number of shares of Preferred Stock (or Buyer Common Stock
after conversion) equal to (i) the Escrow Shares _less_  (ii) any reductions
in the Escrow Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.4_  _less_ (iii) an amount
equal to One Hundred Ten percent (110%) of the amount of the aggregate of all
unsatisfied Indemnity Claims _divided by_  the Indemnity Stock Price and, if
the Preferred Stock has not been converted as of that time, then divided by
100, _less_ (iv) twenty percent (20%) of the Escrow Shares. As each Indemnity
Claim is resolved, the excess Escrow Shares, if any, reserved to satisfy that
Indemnity Claim shall be issued to Sellers.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Escrow Termination Date_. On the Escrow Termination
Date, Continental will release to Sellers in accordance with the allocations
in _Exhibit H_ attached hereto a number of shares of Preferred Stock (or
Buyer Common Stock after conversion) equal to (i) the Escrow Shares _less_
(ii) any reductions in the Escrow Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
not previously deducted pursuant to subsection (i) above _less_ (iii)
an amount equal to One Hundred Ten percent (110%) of the amount of the
aggregate of all unsatisfied Indemnity Claims not previously reserved
pursuant to subsection (i) above _divided by_ the Indemnity Stock Price and,
if the Preferred Stock has not been converted as of that time, then divided
by 100. As each Indemnity Claim is resolved, the excess Escrow Shares, if
any, reserved to satisfy that Indemnity Claim shall be issued to Sellers.

  

#### 

  

#### 16   

     
   

  

#### 

  

Any Escrow Shares held with respect to any unresolved claim for
indemnification and not applied as indemnification with respect to such claim
upon its resolution shall be delivered to such Sellers promptly upon such
resolution.

  



  

## 2.5 _Distributions to Sellers_. Prior to Closing or within five (5)
days after the Closing, Target shall make a cash distribution to Sellers in
the aggregate amount of Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) less any
other distributions made after June 30, 2009, other than the
membership distributions made on or about September 15, 2009 in the aggregate
amount of $2,543,907 (the " _September Distributions_").

  

## 

  

## 2.6 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Sellers such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers.

a particular representation and warranty in this Agreement shall be deemed an
exception to any other representations and warranties in this Agreement to
which it may relate provided the disclosure is in sufficient detail to enable
a reasonable person to identify such other representations and warranties to
which such information is responsive. Failure to provide a cross-reference
from one section of the Disclosure Schedule to other applicable sections of
the Disclosure Schedule shall not, however, in and of itself be deemed a
failure to disclose unless a reasonable person would be unable to determine
that the disclosure contained in such section of the Disclosure Schedule
applies to other representations or warranties contained in this Agreement.

  



  

## 4.1 _Representations Regarding Sellers_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Organization; Authority; No Conflict_. Each Seller that is a trust

Each Seller that is a trust is permitted by such Sellers instrument of trust
and all documents and agreements relating thereto to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by such Seller and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
such Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors generally, or by general equity principles (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Interest Ownership_. Each Seller holds of record and
owns beneficially the Interests set forth opposite his or her name on Section
4.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of any restrictions on
transfer (other than any restrictions under any applicable securities Laws),
Encumbrances, options, warrants, purchase rights, contracts, commitments,
equities, claims and demands. Such Seller is not a party to any option,
warrant, purchase right or other contract or commitment that would require
Seller to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Interest (other
than this Agreement). No Seller is a party to any voting trust, proxy, or
other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any of the
Interest. Sellers have delivered or made available to Buyer copies of all
agreements relating to the Interests.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Broker s Fees_. Except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule, each Seller and his or her agents have incurred
no obligation or Liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or
finders fees, or agents commissions, or other similar payment in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Notices and Consents_. Except as set forth on Section 4.1(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, each Seller is not, and will not be, required to
give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any consent,
authorization or approval of, Target, any member of Target or any managing
member or similar authority of Target or any other Person, including any
Governmental Authority, in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto or the consummation or
performance of the transactions contemplated herein.

  

###

### 

  

### (e) _Registration of Buyer Shares_. Each Seller understands that none of
the Buyer Shares issued to such Seller pursuant to this Agreement has been,
or shall upon delivery be, registered under the Securities Act and that
the certificates evidencing all such securities shall bear a legend to that
effect. Each Seller also understands that such securities are being offered
and sold to such Seller pursuant to an exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act and exemptions from the qualification or
registration provisions of applicable state securities laws, based in part
upon its representations contained in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Investment Intent_. Each Seller is acquiring the Buyer Shares
for its own account solely for the purpose of investment and not for offer or
sale in connection with any distribution thereof.  Each Seller represents
that by reason of such Sellers business and financial experience, and the
business and financial experience of its advisors and representatives, it has
the capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Seller further represents that it is
able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Buyer Shares and has
adequate income independent of any income produced from an investment in such
securities and has sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of all of its
investment in such securities without economic hardship if such a loss should
occur.

entity duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own or use the
properties and assets that it purports to own and use, and to perform all its
obligations under the Contracts. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing under the laws of
each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the
properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by
it, requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify and
be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquired
Company has delivered or made available to Buyer correct and complete copies
of the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, as amended to date

and schedules hereto or the consummation or performance of the

## 

  

## 4.5 _Capitalization_. The Interests issued to Sellers comprise all of the

plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on

the Acquired Companies who are employed by the Acquired Companies or were
employed by the Acquired Companies within the twelve (12) month period prior
to the Closing, or (ii) interfere with the relationship of the Acquired
Companies with any such employees. Sellers agree that the restrictions
contained in this _Section 7.13_ are reasonable as to time and geographic

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## scope because of the nature of the business of the Acquired Companies and
Sellers agree, in particular, that the geographic scope of this restriction
is reasonable because companies engaged in the businesses of the
Acquired Companies compete throughout the Non-Solicitation Area. Sellers
acknowledge that the Acquired Companies are in direct competition with all
other companies engaged in the businesses of the Acquired Companies
throughout the Non-Solicitation Area, and because of the nature of such
businesses, Sellers agree that the covenants contained in this _Section
7.13_ cannot reasonably be limited to any smaller geographic area.

  

## 

  

## 7.14 _Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Tax Returns For Tax Periods Ending Prior to the Closing Date_.
Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and duly and timely file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies that are due for
any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.  Buyer hereby
irrevocably grants Donald Bonaventure the authority to sign such returns on
behalf of Target. At least thirty (30) days prior to filing, Sellers shall
permit Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence not filed prior to execution of this Agreement and shall
make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Buyer.
No position shall be taken in any such Tax Return that is inconsistent with
the past practice of Target without Buyers written consent. No such Tax
Return may make, amend or revoke any Tax election or change any accounting
period, method of accounting or accounting procedure without Buyers prior
written consent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Tax Returns for Straddle Periods_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and duly and timely file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of
the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period. With respect to the Acquired
Companies, Seller shall pay to Buyer within seven (7) days of a request from
Buyer, that amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
Pre-Closing portion of such Tax Period. **** To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the parties shall elect (or cause the Acquired Companies) to
treat the period that includes the Closing Date with respect to any Tax as
ending at the close of the Closing Date and shall take such steps as may be
necessary therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that any
real property or personal property taxes and any annual exemption amounts
shall be allocated based on the relative number of days in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall permit Sellers to
review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding
sentence prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that comments
are provided in a timely manner such that Buyer shall have a reasonable
period of time to review such comments and make revisions prior to filing,
and such comments are consistent with positions taken in prior Tax Returns.
Except to the extent required by applicable Law, no position shall be taken
in any such Tax Return which is inconsistent with the past practice of Target
without Sellers written consent.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Sellers, Buyer and the Acquired
Companies shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any audit, litigation or other

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Proceeding with respect to Taxes; provided that the Party requesting
cooperation shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
cooperating Party. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, recording, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be paid by Target when due, and Target will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, Buyer will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.  Target shall
provide Buyer with (i) evidence satisfactory to Buyer that such Transfer
Taxes have been paid by Target and (ii) a clearance certificate or similar
document(s) which may be required by any state Governmental Authority to
relieve the Buyer of any obligation to withhold any portion of the payments
to Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Tax Election_. Sellers shall not make (or permit any Affiliate to
make) any election under Section 336(e) of the Code (or any similar provision
of applicable state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the Acquired
Companies or transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Amended Returns_. Buyer shall not file, and shall not permit the
Acquired Companies to file, any amended Tax Return with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall
not unreasonably be withheld. To the extent Sellers propose that amended
returns be prepared and filed for any Pre-Closing Period by the Acquired
Companies, Sellers shall advise Buyer of such proposal before undertaking
such amendments. Such returns shall be furnished to Buyer for review and
approval at least 30 days prior to filing but Buyers approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Buyer hereby irrevocably grants Donald Bonaventure the
authority to sign such Pre-Closing Amended Returns on behalf of Target. All
costs related to the preparation of amended income tax returns or other tax
reporting documents proposed to be amended by Sellers, and any professional
services rendered by Sellers tax preparers or other tax advisors incurred in
connection with any audit thereof by any tax authority will be paid by
Sellers.

### (g) _Election Under IRC § 338(h)(10)_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Generally_.  With respect to the purchase of the Interests
hereunder, Sellers (and to the extent necessary, Target) **** and
Buyer shall jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under Code §
338(h)(10), and if permissible, similar elections under any applicable U.S.
state and local or foreign Tax laws (collectively, the " _Section 338
Elections_").

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Sellers Bear Portions of Tax Cost_. Sellers will include any
income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section
338 Elections on their Tax returns and will be responsible for any taxes
associated with the Section 338 

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### Elections; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall reimburse Sellers
for any incremental increase in Taxes resulting from the write-up of fixed
assets only to the extent the increase in tax basis exceeds Twenty-One
Million Dollars ($21,000,000).  The amount of reimbursement due Sellers shall
be calculated as the product of 20% times the "Excess Recapture."  Excess
Recapture is that portion of the "aggregate deemed sales price" (" _ADSP_
") allocable to fixed assets, reduced by the sum of (i) the tax basis of
the fixed assets, (ii) $21,000,000, and (iii) any portion of the gain from
the sale of the fixed assets taxable as Section 1231 gain.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Section 338 Forms_. Buyer will prepare (and will be solely
responsible for preparing) any and all forms necessary to effect the Section
338 Elections (including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883, and any similar forms
under applicable U.S. state and local or foreign Tax laws) (collectively, the
" _Section 338 Forms_"). Sellers will cooperate with Buyer in the
preparation of the Section 338 Forms and will execute such Section 338 Forms
as may be necessary. The IRS Form 8023, properly executed by Sellers, shall
be delivered to Buyer at or prior to the Closing.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) _Allocation_. Buyer will consult with Sellers Representative and
then prepare ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date and delivery to Sellers
Representative a draft schedule allocating the "aggregate deemed sales price"
(" _ADSP_ ") for purposes of IRC § 338(h)(10) among the assets of Company in
accordance with the applicable Treasury regulations (the " _Draft Allocation_
"). Sellers Representative shall have five (5) days to object or consent to
the Draft Allocation. Once Sellers Representative and Buyer agree to the
Draft Allocation it shall be deemed final and binding (the " _Final
Allocation_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (v) _Filing of the Tax Returns_. Buyer, the Acquired Companies and the
Sellers will file all Tax returns (including the Section 338 Forms)
consistent with the Final Allocation and will not voluntarily take any action
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax return, in any refund
claim, in any litigation, or otherwise with respect to such Tax returns,
unless required to pursuant to a final determination of any governmental
authority; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the deemed purchase price of the
assets may differ from the ADSP to the extent necessary to reflect (A)
Buyers capitalized transaction costs not included in the total ADSP, or (B)
any liabilities or other items included in the ADSP but not included in the
deemed purchase price; provided further, that the amount realized upon the
deemed sale of assets may differ from the ADSP to reflect transaction costs
that reduce the amount realized for federal income Tax purposes.

  

#### 

  

### (h) _Audit Matters_. If Buyer or Acquired Companies become aware of any
assessment, official inquiry, examination or proceeding ("Audit") that could
result in an official determination with respect to any Tax for which
the Sellers could be liable, the Buyer shall promptly so notify the Sellers
in writing. If the Sellers become aware of any Audit that could result in an
official determination with respect to any Tax related to the business
activities or assets of the Acquired Companies, Sellers shall promptly so
notify the Buyer in writing.

  



        
   

  



  

### (i) _Control of Audits for Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Sellers shall have
control over all Audits that relate to any tax of Acquired Companies for any
period that ends on or before the Closing Date; provided that, Sellers
Representative shall consult with Buyer regarding any such Audit and Buyer
shall have the right to review and approve any adjustments related to the
same before they are made, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

### (j) _Control of Audits for Post-Closing Tax Periods_. Buyer shall have
sole control over all Audits that relate to any tax of Acquired Companies for
any period that begins after the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (k) _Control of Audits for Straddle Periods_. The Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate as to any Audit that relates to any Tax of Acquired Companies for
any Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (l) _Cooperation_. Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective agents and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with Audits and the preparation of Tax Returns,
including Pre-Closing Amended Returns and shall preserve all information,
returns, books and records and other documents relating to any liabilities
for Taxes with respect to a taxable period until the later of the expiration
of all applicable statutes of limitation and extensions thereof, or a final
determination with respect to Taxes for such period and shall not destroy or
otherwise dispose of any record without first providing the other party with
a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.

  

### 

  

## 7.15 _Access to Records_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
permit Sellers and their authorized representatives to have reasonable access
and duplicating rights during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior
notice to Buyer, to the books and records of the Acquired Companies for
periods prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required: (i) in connection with the preparation of Sellers
accounting records or with any audits, (ii) in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Returns or with any tax audits, or (iii) in connection
with any suit, claim, action, Proceeding or investigation relating to the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ that Sellers shall reimburse Buyer promptly
for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer in connection with any such request.

  

## 

  

## 7.16 _Further Assurances_. In the case at any time after the Closing that
any further action is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Sellers and the proper officers of Buyer and the
Acquired Companies shall take any such reasonably necessary action.

  

## 

  

## 7.17 _Nomination of Buyer Directors_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In connection with the negotiation, consideration and approval of
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Buyer (the " _Buyer Board_ ") has
determined that immediately following the Closing, the Buyer Board will
create two new Class C directorships with terms expiring at the 2011 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of Buyer. The Nominating and Governance Committee of
the Buyer Board has recommended to the Buyer Board, and the Buyer Board has
approved such recommendation, that immediately following the Closing Michael
D. Killgore and Robert A. Tinstman will be appointed to the newly created
Class C directorships.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly following the Closing, and in no event more than three (3)
Business Days following the Closing, the Buyer Board shall pass a resolution
to create two new Class C directorships with terms expiring at the 2011
Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Buyer

  



         
 

  



  

### (in accordance with Section 3.2 of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
Buyer) one of which Class C directorship must be an "independent director" as
set forth in the marketplace rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, and (ii)
appoint Michael D. Killgore and Robert A. Tinstman to fill the vacancies in
the two newly created Class C directorships.  If Michael D. Killgore and
Robert A. Tinstman or their successors are removed or otherwise unable to
serve as a director at any time prior to the 2011 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders of Buyer, the Management Shareholders and Buyers Board of
Directors shall take all steps necessary to allow Sellers Representative to
appoint the successors, however, at all times at least one of the two Class C
directors shall meet the definition of "independent director" as set forth in
the marketplace rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.

  



  

### (c) In addition, Buyer shall allow Sellers Representative to appoint one
person to serve on the Board of Managers or Board of Directors for Target
after the Closing until the Note has been paid in full.

  

### 

  

## 7.18 _Piggyback Registration Rights_.

  



  

### (a) If the Buyer at any time or from time to time subsequent to the
Closing Date proposes to register any securities under the Securities Act
either for its own account or the account of any selling security holders
(other than pursuant to (i) a registration statement on Forms S-4 or S-8 or
any successor or similar forms, or (ii) a registration on any form that does
not permit secondary sales), it will give notice to each of the Sellers of
its intention at least twenty (20) days in advance of the filing of any
registration statement with respect thereto. Upon the written request of any
of the Sellers (such requesting Seller, or its permitted assign, being
referred to herein as a " _Holder_ ") given within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such notice, the Buyer, subject to the sentences below, will use
its reasonable best efforts to include in such registration, and in any
underwriting involved therein, all of the shares of Buyer Common Stock held
as a result of conversion of the Buyer Shares or as Earnout Shares included
in such request (" _Registrable Securities_ ") that are not already covered
by an existing and effective Registration Statement (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "). Provided, however; if in connection with any underwritten
public offering for the account of the Buyer the managing underwriter(s)
thereof shall impose a limitation on the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock held as a result of conversion of the Buyer Shares or as Earnout Shares
that may be included in the registration statement because, in such
underwriter(s) judgment, marketing or other factors dictate such limitation
is necessary to facilitate public distribution, then the Buyer shall be
obligated to include in the registration statement only such limited portion
of the shares of Buyer Common Stock held as a result of conversion of the
Buyer Shares or as Earnout Shares with respect to which a Holder has requested
inclusion hereunder as the underwriter shall permit. Any exclusion of shares
of Buyer Common Stock held as a result of conversion of the Buyer Shares or
as Earnout Shares shall be made pro rata with holders of other securities
having the right to include such securities in the registration statement
other than holders of securities entitled to inclusion of their securities in
the registration statement by reason of demand registration rights. If an
offering in connection with which a Holder elects to participate in
registration is an underwritten offering, then a Holder shall, unless
otherwise agreed by the Buyer, offer and sell such shares of Buyer
Common Stock held as a result of conversion of the Buyer Shares or as Earnout
Shares in an underwritten offering using the same underwriter or underwriters
and on the same terms and conditions as other shares of common stock included
in such underwritten offering. The rights

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### and benefits conferred upon Sellers in this _Section 7.18_ are not
transferable or assignable and shall be terminated with respect to
any portion of the Buyer Shares or shares of Buyer Common Stock held as
a result of conversion of the Buyer Shares or as Earnout Shares that are
sold, assigned or otherwise transferred unless such transfer is to a family
member as a result of the depth of such Seller.

  

### 

  

### (b) All expenses incurred in complying with this Section, including,
without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses _,_
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Buyer, expenses of any special
audits incident to or required by any such registration and expenses of
complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, shall be
paid by the Buyer, except that the Buyer shall not be liable for any fees,
discounts or commissions to any underwriter of the Registrable Securities.

  

### 

  

### (c) The provisions of this Section shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon only the permitted successors and assigns of each Holder
pursuant to _Section 7.18(a)_ of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 7.19 _Amendments of Schedules_. If Buyer Representatives have actual
knowledge prior to the Closing of the existence of a breach of
a representation and warranty made by Sellers or Acquired Companies under
this Agreement and fail to disclose such to Sellers prior to the Closing,
then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all rights and remedies related to
such breach. Sellers and Target may, from time to time, prior to the Closing
Date, by written notice to Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule
attached to this Agreement to correct any matter that would constitute a
breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers or Acquired Companies
herein contained.  Buyer shall have ten (10) Business Days (the " _Review
Period_ ") to review such supplement or amendment and the Closing Date shall
be postponed as necessary for Buyer to do so. On or before the end of the
Review Period, Buyer shall have the right in its sole discretion to either
(i) terminate in writing this Agreement by issuing a Termination Notice to
Sellers and Target provided that the supplement or amendment to the
Disclosure Schedule together with any other supplements or amendments
collectively involves an amount in excess of $3,000,000 (the " _Walk Away
Right_ "), and the Deductible shall not apply against the $3,000,000 amount;
or (ii) notify Sellers and Target in writing (the " _Cure Notice_ ") that
Buyer wants Sellers to cure the breach and inform Target of an
acceptable cure; provided, however, that if Buyer does not deliver the Cure
or Termination Notice prior to the end of the Review Period, then Buyer shall
be deemed to have waived all rights and remedies related to such breach. If
after receiving a Cure Notice, Sellers elect to attempt to cure the breach,
then, at Targets expense, it shall have up to sixty (60) days (the " _Cure
Period_ ") to complete the cure, which period of time may run prior to or
after the Closing, at the sole option of Buyer. In the event Buyer believes
that a cure has not been made by Sellers of an alleged breach at the end of
the Cure Period, Buyer may pursue a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Article
8_ of this Agreement if a Closing has occurred or if a Closing has not
occurred terminate this Agreement by issuing a Termination Notice to Sellers
and Target. Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of any supplements or
amendments to the Disclosure Schedule as soon as practicable after Sellers or
Acquired Company becomes aware of the need for such supplement or amendment.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 7.20 _Indemnification of Directors Serving on Buyer s Board_. Buyer shall
provide all directors on Buyers Board of Directors the same DandO coverage
and indemnity afforded by the Buyer.

  

## 

  

## 7.21 _Indemnification of Target s Managers_. After the Closing, Buyer
shall cause Target to indemnify and provide DandO coverage to all managers of
Target in a uniform manner.

  

## 

  

## 7.22 _Termination of UCC Fixture Filings and Equipment Filings._ Seller
shall cause all UCC fixture filings (but not any UCC equipment filings) other
than those in favor of JP Morgan Chase and/or Bank One to be terminated and
released at Closing. Seller shall cause all other UCC filings (including UCC
equipment filings) to be terminated and released at Closing to the extent the
applicable equipment lease or indebtedness related to each UCC filing has
been paid off prior to Closing.

  

## 

  

## 7.23 _Credit Facility._  If JP Morgan Chase conditions its consent to
this transaction on any conditions other than keeping its existing security
interests in place under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
as amended, by and among Angelo E. Iafrate Construction Company, Target and
Bank One, NA dated December 11, 2003 (the " _Credit Facility_ "), and Buyer,
in its sole and absolute discretion, does not approve of any such conditions
and, instead, elects to provide its workers compensation insurance provider
with alternative security acceptable to such insurance provider, Sellers
shall cause the Credit Facility and all security interests related thereto
(including, without limitation, all mortgages, pledges, guaranties and UCC
filings (including UCC equipment and fixture filings)) to be terminated and
released at Closing.

# ARTICLE 8 
  _INDEMNIFICATION_

  

# 

  

## 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing hereunder (even if the damaged Party knew or had reason
to know of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant at the
time of Closing) and continue in full force and effect until the Escrow
Termination Date. All of the representations and warranties of Sellers and
Acquired Companies contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
hereunder and continue in full force and effect until April 15, 2011 (even if
Buyer knew or had reason to know of any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant at the time of Closing subject to _Section
7.19_), except:

  

## 

  

### (a) with respect to representations and warranties contained in _Sections
4.1(a), (b), (c), and (d)_ (Representations Regarding Sellers), the first
two sentences of _Section 4.3_ and _Section 4.3(a)_ (Authority; No
Conflict), _Section 4.5_ (Capitalization), and _Section 4.12_ (Taxes) but
only with respect to federal and state income Taxes (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Representations_ "), which shall survive the Closing hereunder
(even if the damaged Party knew or had reason to know of any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant at the time of Closing
subject to _Section 7.19_) and continue in full force and effect until
forever thereafter (subject to any applicable statutes of limitations); and

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### (b) with respect to representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.2_ (Organization and Good Standing), the first sentence of _Section 4.8_
(Assets) and _Section 4.16_ (Legal Proceedings), which shall survive the
Closing until April 15, 2013; and

  

### 

  

### (c) with respect to representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.20_ (Environmental, Health and Safety Matters), which shall survive the
Closing until April 15, 2015.

  

### 

  

By "survival" the Parties do not intend to suggest that any representation or
warranty hereunder is made at any time other than the times specified herein
(as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date where
applicable). The covenants of the Parties contained herein shall continue in
accordance with their respective terms and survive forever thereafter
(subject to any applicable statutes of limitations), except that Sellers
Liability under any covenants contained in _Article 7_ of this Agreement
shall only survive until April 15, 2013. The period of time a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant
to this _Section 8.1_ shall be the " _Survival Period_ " with respect to
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.  Indemnity Claims
under _Section 8.2(iii)_ shall only survive until April 15, 2015, which
shall be its Survival Period. Indemnity Claims under _Section 8.3_ shall
only survive until April 15, 2011 (except with respect to federal and state
income Tax issues which shall survive forever thereafter (subject to any
applicable statutes of limitations)), which shall be its Survival Period. So
long as an Indemnified Party gives notice of an indemnification claim on or
before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to pursue its rights to indemnification under
_Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4_, as applicable. No party hereunder shall have
any liability under this _Article 8_ for any indemnification claim made
after the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. In the event notice of
any claim for indemnification under _Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4_ shall have
been given within the applicable Survival Period and such claim has not been
finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival Period, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements that are the subject of
such claim shall survive the end of the Survival Period of such
representations, warranties and covenants until such claim is finally
resolved, but such representations and warranties shall only survive with
respect to such asserted claim. Subject to _Section 7.19_, any claim by an
Indemnified Party for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any
investigation by or opportunity to investigate afforded to such party, nor
shall such a claim be adversely affected by such partys Knowledge on
or before the Closing Date of any breach of the type specified in _Section
8.2, 8.3 or 8.4_ or of any state of facts that may give rise to such
a breach. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on
such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations except as provided
in _Section 7.19_.

  



  

## 8.2 _Indemnification of Buyer_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article
8,_ Sellers shall, severally in accordance with _Section 8.14_, indemnify,
defend, save and keep Buyer and its respective Affiliates (including each
Acquired Company), their respective members, managers, officers, directors,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), harmless
against and from all liability, demands, claims, actions or causes of action,
assessments, losses, fines, penalties, costs, damages, deficiencies, and
expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, court
costs and other fees, disbursements and expenses, whether

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## payable in cash, property or otherwise (collectively, " _Damages_ ")
sustained or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees to the extent they are
a result of, arise out of or are by virtue of: (i) any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty, of the Acquired Companies or
Sellers, set forth in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto, or
any written statement or certificate furnished or to be furnished to Buyer
pursuant hereto or in any closing document delivered by the Acquired
Companies or Sellers to Buyer in connection herewith other than the Ancillary
Agreements which shall stand on their own, (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment
of any covenant on the part of the Acquired Companies or Sellers, set forth
in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto, or any written statement
or certificate furnished or to be furnished to Buyer pursuant hereto or in
any closing document delivered by the Acquired Companies or Seller to Buyer
in connection herewith other than the Ancillary Agreements which shall stand
on their own;, (iii) any Environmental Actions relating to, arising out of or
resulting from (a) the Environmental Conditions of any Acquired Company
Facility owned currently or in the past in whole or in part by any Sellers or
Acquired Company arising out of or resulting from conditions that were in
existence as of, or operations or activities that occurred prior to, the
Closing Date, (b) any Environmental Conditions known to Sellers or Acquired
Companies at the time of the Closing for any Acquired Company Facility which
is or was leased by an Acquired Company from an independent third party, or
(c) any act or omission of any Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing
Date; or (iv) any matter set forth on _Schedule 8.2_. Such obligations
apply regardless of the presence of a Third-Party Claim. For purposes of
determining the amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided
hereunder (but not for the purpose of determining whether a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant has occurred), each of the
representations, warranties and covenants made by any Party in this
Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant
hereto, shall be deemed to have been made without the inclusion of
limitations or qualifications as to materiality such as the word
"material," if with the inclusion of such limitation or qualification the
representation, warranty or covenant was breached.

  

## 

  

## 8.3 _Indemnification for Taxes_. Sellers shall, severally, in accordance
with _Section 8.14_, indemnify, save and hold Buyer harmless from and
against any and all losses incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from or incident to (i) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or any Straddle Period) to the extent
the Tax is allocable (as determined in _Section 7.12(b)_ hereof) to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period), (ii) the unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than the
Acquired Companies) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee
or successor, by contract, or otherwise, and (iii) Buyers inability,
other than through the fault of Buyer, to receive the income tax benefits
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, or any transaction that
would result in substantially the same tax benefits to Buyer, such as Target
being a partnership as of the Closing Date for federal tax purposes, solely
as the result of the breach or inaccuracy of the representations by Sellers
contained in this Agreement, or the action or inaction of the Sellers, as
provided in Section 8.11.

  

## 

  

## 8.4 _Indemnification of Sellers_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article 8,_ Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save and keep Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_
") harmless against and from all Damages sustained or incurred by Seller
Indemnitees to the extent they are a result of, arise out of or are by virtue
of (i) any misrepresentations or breach of any

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule hereto, or any written statement or certificate furnished or to be
furnished to Sellers pursuant hereto or in any closing document delivered by
Buyer to Sellers in connection herewith or (ii) any non-fulfillment of any
covenant on the part of Buyer, set forth in this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule hereto, or any written statement or certificate furnished or to be
furnished to Sellers pursuant hereto or in any closing document delivered by
Buyer to Seller in connection herewith (other than claims made under the Note
which shall not be subject to this _Article 8)_.  Such obligations apply
regardless of the presence of a Third Party Claim (as defined below). For
purposes of determining the amount of Damages for which indemnification is
provided hereunder (but not for the purpose of determining whether a breach
of a representation, warranty or covenant has occurred), each of
the representations, warranties and covenants made by any party in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant
hereto, shall be deemed to have been made without the inclusion of
limitations or qualifications as to materiality such as the word "material,"
if with the inclusion of such limitation or qualification the representation,
warranty or covenant was breached.

  

## 

  

## 8.5 _Procedures for Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) If a claim for Damages (an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), other than Third-
Party Claims under _Section 8.5(b)_ below, is to be made by a Person
entitled to indemnification under this _Article 8_ (an " _Indemnified Party_
"), such party shall give written notice briefly describing the claim and the
total monetary damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to Sellers
Representative or Buyer, as applicable (each an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") as
soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which gives rise to Damages for which indemnification may
be sought under this _Article 8_. Any failure to submit any such notice
of claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party
of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the
Notice and the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the
Damages at issue if the Indemnifying Party does not send a notice of
disagreement to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the Notice.  If the Indemnifying Party does not send a notice of
disagreement to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnified Party the amount sufficient to pay the Damages. For
the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall only be required to send notices to and
obtain the approval of the Sellers Representative with respect to this
_Section 8.5_.

  

### 

  

### (b) If an Indemnity Claim is to be made by an Indemnified Party entitled
to indemnification hereunder in respect of, arising out of or involving a
claim made by any third party (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall give a Notice to the
Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable after becoming aware of such Third-
Party Claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice
hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party
was actually prejudiced by such failure. After such Notice, if the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing to an Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party is liable and has indemnity obligations for any Damages
resulting from any such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled, if it so elects at its own

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and
investigation of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys
of its own choice (provided that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the named
parties to such action or proceeding include the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, and any such Indemnified Party has been advised in
writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to
such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, in which event such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties cost, risk and expense, to
separate counsel of its own choosing, and (iii) to compromise or settle such
claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided that any such compromise or settlement shall provide for
the absolute and unconditional release of the Indemnified Parties from any
Liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim (to the extent permitted above),
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense
of such Third-Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, participate in
the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal
arising therefrom. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in any
notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the
Notice (whether as a result of its election not to assume such defense), the
Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted will have the
right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties cost, risk and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and
for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that such claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the
Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party may, at its own cost, participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal
arising therefrom.  The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement
of any Third-Party Claim effected pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section 8.5_ and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal),
and each Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Party from and against any Damages by reason of such settlement
or judgment subject to the limitations provided in this _Article 8_.

  

### 

  

## 8.6 _Resolution of Conflicts and Claims_. If an Indemnifying Party objects
in writing to any Indemnity Claim for indemnification made by an Indemnified
Party in any written Notice (an " _Objection Notice_ "), Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims, and Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall provide information to the other party (as
reasonably requested) related to the issues set forth in the Objection
Notice. If Sellers Representative and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 8.7 _Payment of Damages_.

  

## 

  

### (a) All amounts under this _Article 8_ shall be paid within five (5)
calendar days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of
the Parties or on the date on which both such amount and the Indemnifying
Partys obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final
judgment of a court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such
proceeding pursuant to _Section 9.15_.

  

### 

  

### (b) Any claims for Damages asserted by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitees
prior to the Escrow Termination Date (provided that this reference is not
intended to extend the applicable Survival Period) for which Sellers owe
Buyer indemnity under this _Article 8_ shall be first satisfied by reduction
of the Escrow Shares in an amount equal to the amount of such claim divided
by the Indemnity Stock Price, in accordance with _Section 8.14_. Subject to
the limitations of _Section 8.8_, any claims for Damages asserted during the
applicable Survival Period which cannot be satisfied by the release of Escrow
Shares which are asserted by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee shall be satisfied
by Sellers payment of cash or other immediately available funds in
accordance with _Section 8.14_. Buyer shall have no right of offset
against the Note or other indebtedness owed Sellers.  Any claims for Damages
asserted by Sellers or any Seller Indemnitees (but not an Acquired Company)
for which Buyer owe Sellers indemnity under this _Article 8_ shall be
satisfied by Buyers payment of cash or other immediately available funds.

  

### 

  

## 8.8 _Limitations on Indemnity_. An Indemnifying Party shall not have
any liability for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.2(i), 8.2(iii)
and 8.3_ (only with respect to all matters other than federal and state
income Taxes) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages which are
incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party exceeds the Deductible, and in
the event the aggregate amount of Damages for which such Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification exceeds the Deductible, such Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to recover only the amount of such Damages in excess of the
Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply to Damages
resulting from the breach of Fundamental Representations, breach of the
representations contained in _Section 4.2_ (Organization and Good Standing)
or the first sentence of _Section 4.8_ (Assets), or liability under _Section
8.3_ but only to the extent it relates to federal and state income Taxes. An
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Damages, or be required to
make payments for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.2 and 8.3_ , in an
aggregate amount in excess of $9,375,000 (the " _Cap_ "); provided, however,
that the Cap shall not apply to Damages resulting from the breach of
Fundamental Representations or liability under _Section 8.3_ but only to the
extent it relates to federal and state income Taxes; provided, further, in
the event of an Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 8.3(iii) then the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Damages in excess of the
Cap plus an additional $5,000,000; provided, further, Indemnification Claims
for the loss of tax benefit pursuant to Section 8.3(iii) shall only be
made pursuant to Section 8.3(iii).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if an Indemnified Party is seeking, or is entitled to seek,
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party for Damages due to such
Indemnifying Partys Fraud or Intentional and Willful Violation, the
limitations in this _Section 8.8_ (including the Deductible and the Cap)
shall not be applicable to, or otherwise limit an Indemnified Partys
recovery for, such claim. **** For the purpose of this agreement, " _Fraud_ "
shall mean an intentional and willful false statement of fact made by Sellers
with actual knowledge of the falsity of such fact for the purpose in inducing
Buyer to enter into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which
is relied on by Buyer in entering into the

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the purpose of this
Agreement, " _Intentional and Willful Violation_ " means the refusal or
failure to perform a covenant under this Agreement provided the Seller who
refuses or fails to perform such covenant had no intention at the time such
Seller entered into this Agreement to perform such covenant.

  

## 

  

## 8.9 _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Damages that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ are covered by insurance paid
for by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such
insurance; _provided_ that Buyer shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a
claim for indemnification under this _Article 8_ in respect of such Damages
and the time limitations set forth in _Section 8.8_ for bringing a claim of
indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of
such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by Buyer for monies from an
insurer or against a third party in respect of any Damages shall not,
however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions
contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by Sellers
Representative. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is
the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any other third party shall
be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  

## 

  

## 8.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole remedy of
the Parties with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to
the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
8_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article
8_, except _Section 8.14_, shall in any way impair, modify or
otherwise limit a Partys right to bring any claim, demand or suit against
the other party based upon such other Partys actual Fraud or Intentional and
Willful Violation, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation
and warranty does not constitute Fraud.

  

## 

  

## 8.11 _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification
is provided shall be reduced by any net Tax benefit to such indemnified party
and its Affiliates, to the extent realized by such party as a result of such
Damages, net of any Tax costs incurred by the indemnified party as a result
of the receipt of the indemnification payments hereunder. In calculating the
amount of net Tax benefit, the indemnified party and its Affiliates shall be
presumed to pay Taxes at a forty percent (40%) Tax rate. The indemnified
party shall provide the indemnifying party with such documentation as may be
reasonably requested in order to ascertain or confirm the amount of any net
Tax benefit or net Tax cost referred to herein. Without limiting the scope of
the foregoing, Sellers recognize that tax benefits inuring to Buyer as a
result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election provided for herein are a material
financial incentive to Buyer in completing this transaction. Sellers
recognize that the Sellers representation of S corporation or partnership
status provided in Section 4.12(1) is material to this election, and
accordingly expressly include the income tax benefits resulting from the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections, or any transaction that would result in
substantially the same tax benefits to Buyer, calculated on a present value
basis at an eight percent (8%) discount rate shall be included in the
indemnification for Taxes under Section 8.3 of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 8.12 _Mitigation_. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to mitigate Damages suffered, incurred or sustained by it arising out
of any matter for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided
that no Indemnified Party shall be required to (i) take any action or refrain
from taking any action that is contrary to any applicable contract, order or
Law binding on it or any Affiliate thereof or (ii) incur any out-of-pocket
expense in connection with such mitigation (other than de minimus incidental
expenses).

  

## 

  

## 8.13 _No Double Recovery_. To the extent that any of the items or matters
that would otherwise constitute Damages have been "incurred" and have already
been incorporated in the calculation of EBITDA for the purposes of _Section
2.3_ of this Agreement, such items or matters shall not also be a Damage
for purposes of indemnity under this _Article 8_ and shall not
apply against the Deductible. Conversely, to the extent any Damage has been
incurred that has applied against the Deductible or has been indemnified,
such Damage shall not be included in the calculation of EBITDA for the
purposes of _Section 2.3_ of this Agreement. To the extent that there are
reserves in the Financial Statements for any matter which may be
an Indemnified Claim against the Sellers, any Damages shall first apply
against any such applicable reserve and thereafter to the extent permitted
herein, against the Deductible.

  

## 

  

## 8.14 _Additional Indemnity Limitations_. In addition to the other
limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ on Indemnity Claims that Buyer
Indemnitees may have, the following apply:

  

## 

  

### (a) Indemnity Claims relating to the breach of a representation and
warranty under _Section 4.1_, or as a result of a Seller failing to pay all
of the Taxes owed by that Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, may only be made against the Seller that breached such
representation and warranty or that failed to pay such Taxes, and, as a
result thereof, Buyer may only retain Escrow Shares allocated to that Seller
(in which case the Escrow Shares released to the Sellers may not be in
accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit A_) and/or pursue
only that Seller for any remaining Monetary Damage; and

  

### 

  

### (b) Indemnity Claims relating to the breach of a covenant or agreement by
a particular Seller may only be made against the Seller that breached such
covenant or agreement and, as a result thereof, Buyer may only retain Escrow
Shares allocated to that Seller (in which case the Escrow Shares released to
the Sellers may not be in accordance with the percentages set forth in
_Exhibit A_) and/or pursue only that Seller for any remaining Monetary
Damage; and

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) above, Sellers shall
be liable for all Indemnity Claims on a several basis as set forth in this
paragraph. In the event that Buyer satisfies such Indemnity Claims with
Escrow Shares, which it is first required to do before seeking money Damages,
Buyer must retain Escrow Shares pro rata in accordance with the percentages
set forth in _Exhibit A_. Further, each Sellers share of any Liability for
any Indemnity Claim for money damages in excess of the Escrow Shares shall be
equal to the percentage set forth in _Exhibit O_, except that (i) the share
of Michael D. Killgore, Donald B. Bonaventure, and Danny L. Hester, shall be
limited to 120% of the percentage set forth on _Exhibit O_ for that Seller
and (ii) the five trusts that are Sellers shall be directly responsible for
Indemnity Claims related to a breach of Section 4.1.

  



         
 

  



  

### (d) It is understood that all Liability under Article 8 of this Agreement
(except for Liability related to a breach of Section 4.1) of the five trusts
that are Sellers shall be the responsibility of either Dominic Iafrate or
Angelo E. Iafrate, whichever is the current trustee of such trust. If one or
more of such trusts breaches any representation, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or takes any action or inaction which leads to an Indemnity
Claim pursuant to this Article 8, then such Indemnity Claim will be paid by
either Dominic Iafrate or Angelo E. Iafrate, whichever is the current trustee
of such trust.

  



  

# ARTICLE 9 
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  

# 

  

## 9.1 _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. Neither Party shall issue
any press release or make any public announcement or other
disclosure relating to the existence or subject matter of this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any Party may make any public announcement or disclosure
concerning its publicly-traded securities it believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law, any listing or trading agreement, or the rules
and regulations of NASDAQ (in which case the disclosing Party will use its
reasonable best efforts to advise the other Party prior to making the
disclosure), including but not limited to the filing by Buyer of a Current
Report on Form 8-K (the " _Buyer 8-K_ ") to report execution of this
Agreement.  In connection with the preparation of the Buyer 8-K, Sellers
shall, upon request by Buyer, furnish Buyer with all information as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Seller warrants and represents to Buyer
that all such information shall be true and correct in all material respects
and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. At or after the execution of this Agreement,
Sellers and Buyer shall jointly issue a public announcement and/or press
release and/or other disclosure, as shall be mutually agreed, of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party will not unreasonably
withhold approval from the others with respect to any press release or
public announcement. If any Party determines with the advice of counsel that
it is required to make this Agreement and the terms of the transaction public
or otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with respect
thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making any public disclosure,
consult with the other party regarding such disclosure, seek such
confidential treatment for such terms or portions of this Agreement or the
transaction as may be reasonably requested by the other Party and disclose
only such information as is legally compelled to be disclosed. This provision
will not apply to communications by any party to its counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors.

  

## 

  

## 9.2 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns except for the third party
beneficiaries referenced in _Sections 7.20 and 7.21_..

  

## 

  

## 9.3 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (including the documents the forms
of which are attached as exhibits and schedules hereto) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, representations or obligations by or among the Parties, written
or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

  



        
   

  



  

## 9.4 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer may (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer
nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder).

  

## 

  

## 9.5 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same document and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile to counsel
for the other party of a counterpart executed by a party shall be deemed to
meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

  

## 

  

## 9.6 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

## 9.7 _Notices_.  All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request, demand,
claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given on the

Either Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim, or other
communication hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth
above using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier,
messenger service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic mail), but
no such notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication shall be
deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by
the intended recipient. Either Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

  



  

## 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

## 

  

## 9.9 _Amendments, Modifications and Waivers_. No amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same
shall be in writing and signed by Buyer and Sellers Representative. No
waiver by either Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  



        
   

  



  

## 9.10 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  

## 

  

## 9.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
the Parties will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and all
documents related hereto and any expenses related to the due
diligence investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Target shall bear and
be responsible for any costs and expenses (including any of legal, accounting
and audit fees and expenses and Targets share of the filing fees relating to
the Competition Law Filings) incurred by the Acquired Companies or Sellers
in connection with the foregoing and any such expense borne by any of the
Acquired Companies or Sellers shall be paid prior to the Closing Date or
within 30 days thereafter and shall be charged as an expense in the Second
Half Earnings Period. Buyer and Target shall each pay fifty percent (50%) on
any filing fees relating to the Competition Law Filings.

  

## 

  

## 9.12 _Construction_. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The
Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
which the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or
covenant. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

## 

  

## 9.13 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The exhibits
and schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

  

## 

  

## 9.14 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached.  Accordingly, each of the
Parties agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court
of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Party
and the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in _Section 9.15_
below), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law
or in equity.

  

## 

  

## 9.15 _Arbitration_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
other Ancillary Agreements or the breach thereof shall be settled by
arbitration in Harris County, Texas.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services_. The arbitration
shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("
_JAMS_ ") in its Harris County, Texas, office.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Arbitrator_. The arbitrator shall be a retired superior or appellate
court judge of the State of Texas affiliated with JAMS. The award of the
arbitrator shall be binding, final, and nonappealable.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Provisional Remedies and Appeals_. Each of the Parties reserves the
right to file with a court of competent jurisdiction an application for
temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, writ of attachment, writ of
possession, temporary protective order and/or appointment of a receiver on
the grounds that the arbitration award to which the applicant may be entitled
may be rendered ineffectual in the absence of such relief.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Enforcement of Judgment_. Judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Discovery_. The parties may obtain discovery in aid of the
arbitration to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. All discovery
disputes shall be resolved by the arbitrator.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Consolidation_. Any arbitration hereunder may be consolidated by
JAMS with the arbitration of any other dispute arising out of or relating
to the same subject matter when the arbitrator determines that there is a
common issue of law or fact creating the possibility of conflicting rulings
by more than one arbitrator. Any disputes over which arbitrator shall hear

Fees_**.

  

# 

  

## 2.1 **_Payments of Principal and Interest_**.  Beginning on the Issuance
Date, the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest at
the Applicable Interest Rate and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day
year and the actual number of days elapsed.  Payments of principal and
interest shall be payable in cash in sixty (60) equal and fully amortizing
monthly payments of principal and interest commencing
, 2009 and ending on the Maturity Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Issuer or any of its Affiliates raise additional capital or increase
the balance due under any Qualified Debt (whether equity or debt), then
Issuer shall notify Holders of same and:

  

## 

  

## (a) Issuer shall prepay this Note in an amount equal to (i) one hundred
percent (100%) of the first Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of Net Equity
raised (excluding the proceeds received from the exercise of any warrant
outstanding on the date hereof, with respect to which Issuer hereby

three percent (33%) of Qualified Debt raised, if any, and

  

##

## 

  

## (c) Any prepayment required by this Section shall be due within ten (10)
business days of the receipt of cash proceeds by Issuer.

  

## 

  

## 2.2 **_Default Interest Rate_**. If any amount of principal or interest
on this Note is not paid when due the entire outstanding principal balance of
the Note shall bear interest at a rate to the Applicable Interest Rate plus
two percent (2%) from the due date of such installment of such principal or
interest until such default is cured by the payment of all principal and
interest and late fees then due ("Default Interest"). The incurrence of
Default Interest shall not excuse late payment.

  

## 

  

## 2.3 **_Late Fees_**. Should any payment under this Note not be paid when
due and payable, it is recognized by Issuer that the Holders will incur extra
expenses for handling the delinquent payment. The exact amount of said
extra expenses is impossible to ascertain at this time, but a charge of two
percent (2%) of the amount of the delinquent payment would be a fair

  



        
   

  



  

## approximation of the expense so incurred by the Holders.  Therefore, in
the event a payment is received more than ten (10) days after the date on
which it was due, Issuer shall, without notice and without prejudice to the
right of the Holders to declare an Event of Default or to collect any other
amounts due hereunder, pay to the Holders a "late charge" equal to two
percent (2%) of the amount of the delinquent payment. At the option of Issuer,
said late charge may be added to the principal under this Note.

  

## 

  

## 2.4 **_No Right of Offset_**. Issuer shall have no right to set off
against payments due under this Note.

  

## 

  

## 2.5 **_Allocation Among Holders_**. All payments under this Note whether
principal, interest, late fees, and expenses shall be paid to the Holders pro
rata based on the principal balance due each Holder.

  

## 

  

# 3. **_Payment on Non-Business Days_**. Whenever any payment to be made
shall be due on a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday under the laws of the
State of California, such payment may be due on the next succeeding business
day and such next succeeding day shall be included in the calculation of the
amount of accrued interest payable on such date.

  

# 

  

# 4. **_Prepayment_**.  Upon five (5) days prior written notice to the
Holders, Issuer may prepay this Note in whole or in part; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such prepayment will be applied first to the payment of
expenses due under this Note, second to interest accrued on this Note and
third, if the amount of prepayment exceeds the amount of all such expenses
and accrued interest, to the payment of principal of this Note as described
in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.5.

  

# 

  

# 5. **_Events of Default_**.  The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute an " **Event of Default** " under this Note:

  

# 

  

## 5.1 **_Failure to Pay_**.  Issuer shall fail to pay when due any payment
required under the terms of this Note by the end of the tenth day following
the due date.

  

## 

  

## 5.2 **_Breaches of Covenants_**.  Issuer shall fail to observe or perform
any covenant set forth in _Section 8_ and such failure shall continue for
twenty (20) days after Issuers receipt of Holders written notice to Issuer
of such breach.

  

## 

  

## 5.3 **_Voluntary Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings_**. Issuer shall (i)
apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or
custodian of itself or of all or a substantial part of its property, (ii) be
unable, or admit in writing its inability, to pay its debts generally as they
mature, (iii) make a general assignment for the benefit of its or any of its
creditors, (iv) be dissolved or liquidated, (v) become insolvent (as such
term may be defined or interpreted under any applicable statute), (vi)
commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its debts under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or
consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession of
its property by any official in an involuntary case or other proceeding
commenced against it, or (vii) take any action for the purpose of effecting
any of the foregoing.

  



        
   

  



  

## 5.4 **_Involuntary Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings_**. Proceedings
for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or custodian of Issuer
or of all or a substantial part of its property, or an involuntary case or
other proceedings seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with
respect to Issuer or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect shall be commenced and an order for
relief entered or such proceeding shall not be dismissed or discharged within

# 6. **_Rights of Holder Upon Default_**. Upon the occurrence or existence of
any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default referred to in
_Sections 5.3 and 5.4_ ) and at any time thereafter during the continuance of
such Event of Default, Holder may declare all outstanding Obligations payable
by Issuer hereunder to be immediately due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived; _provided, however_ , if the Event of Default is the failure
to pay as set forth in _Section 5.1_ and the reason for Issuers failure to
pay is that Issuer is contractually prohibited from making a payment due
to the terms of the Subordination Agreements, then the Holders shall not
be entitled to declare all outstanding Obligations payable by Issuer until
the earlier of (a) the date that is 180 days after the date that the Event
of Default was triggered, or (ii) the date 10 days after the
contractual prohibition to payment has been removed.  Upon the occurrence or
existence of any Event of Default described in _Sections 5.3 and 5.4_ ,
immediately and without notice, all outstanding Obligations payable by Issuer
hereunder shall automatically become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived. In addition to the foregoing remedies, upon the
occurrence or existence of any Event of Default, Holder may exercise any
other right power or remedy permitted by law, either by suit in equity or by
action at law, or both.

  



        
   

  



  

# 7. **_Holders Representative_**. Each Holder by executing this Note hereby
constitutes and appoints Donald B. Bonaventure as Holders Representative,
with full power and authority to act in the name of and for and on behalf of
such Holder with respect to the receipt of payments due under this Note. Each
Holder by executing this Note hereby constitutes and appoints Donald B.
Bonaventure as Holders Representative, with full power and authority to act
in the name of and for and on behalf of such Holder with respect to all other
matters arising in connection with, or related to, this Note and the
transactions contemplated hereby upon written authorization with respect to
any matter from Holders entitled to receive 51% of the total payments under
the Note yet unpaid. Each Holder agrees that Issuer and its Affiliates shall
have the absolute right and authority to rely upon the acts taken or omitted
to be taken by Holders Representative on behalf of the Holders with respect
to the receipt of payments due under this Note and shall have no liability
with respect thereto, and none of Issuer or any of its Affiliates shall have
any duty to inquire as to the acts and omissions of Holders Representative
with respect to the receipt of payments due under this Note. Each Holder
agrees that all deliveries by Issuer of any payment of principal and interest
under this Note to Holders Representative shall be deemed deliveries to the
Holders; Issuer shall not have any liability with respect to any aspect of
the distribution or communication of such deliveries between Holders
Representative and any Holder; and any disclosure made to Holders
Representative by or on behalf of Issuer shall be deemed to be a disclosure
made to each Holder. Each Holder agrees that any payment made by or on behalf
of Issuer to Holders Representative on a Holders behalf shall be deemed a
direct payment to a Holder, and no Holder shall have any recourse against
Issuer or any of its Affiliates in the event that such payment is
not delivered to such Holder by Holders Representative for any reason. All
rights of the Holders shall be held and exercised by the Holders
Representative and Issuer shall only be obligated to make payments to and to
respond to notices, demands and inquiries from the Holders Representative.
In the event the Holders Representative refuses to, or is no longer capable
of, serving as Holders Representative hereunder, or if a majority of the
Holders on the basis of the principal due all Holders under this Note notify
Issuer that Donald B. Bonaventure has been replaced, the Holders shall
promptly appoint a successor Holders Representative and shall thereafter be
a successor Holders Representative hereunder, and Holders Representative
shall serve until such successor is duly appointed and qualified to act
hereunder.

### (ii) Seller will not, directly or indirectly, at any time during the term
of this Agreement (from the Effective Date through the Termination Date): (A)
employ, or permit any company or business directly or indirectly controlled
by Seller to employ, any person who is employed by Buyer or any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Buyer (an "
_Affiliate_ "); (B) interfere with or attempt to disrupt the relationship,
contractual or otherwise, between Buyer or any of its Affiliates and any of
their employees or consultants; (C) solicit or in any manner seek to induce
any employee or consultant of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate his
or her employment or engagement with Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or (D)
within the Territory, solicit any customers of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
unless such solicitation is not related to the Business.

  

### 

  

## (b) Notwithstanding _Section 1(a)_ of this Agreement, Seller shall not be
precluded from purchasing or owning stock in a publicly-held corporation if
Sellers holdings are less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding capital
stock of such corporation and will not be precluded from owning an interest
in Buyer.

  



        
   

  



  

# 2. **_Acknowledgments of_** ** _Seller_**. Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that:

  

# 

  

## (a) this Agreement is necessary for the protection of the legitimate
business interests of Buyer and its Affiliates;

  

## 

  

## (b) the restrictions contained in this Agreement regarding geographical
scope, length of term and types of activities restricted are reasonable;

  

## 

  

## (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a mandatory condition
precedent to the consummation by Buyer of the transactions provided for in
the Purchase Agreement;

  

## 

  

## (d) Seller has no intention of competing with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the Business within the limitations set forth
above; and

  

## 

  

## (e) as an owner of the Company and through his ownership of the Company,
Seller has received, either directly or indirectly, adequate and valuable
consideration for entering into this Agreement.

  

## 

  

# 3. **_Extension; Equitable Relief; Fees and Expenses_**.

  

# 

  

## (a) If Seller is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
violated the provisions of _Section 1_ hereinabove, the term described
therein will be extended by that number of days which is equal to the
aggregate number of days during which, at any time, Seller committed any such
violation.

  

## 

  

## (b) Seller stipulates and agrees that any breach of this Agreement by
Seller will result in immediate and irreparable harm to Buyer and its
Affiliates, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain, and
that Buyer could not be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in an
action at law.  For these reasons, Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have
the right to obtain such preliminary, temporary or permanent mandatory or
restraining injunctions, orders or decrees as may be necessary to protect
Buyer or any of its Affiliates against, or on account of, any breach by
Seller of the provisions of _Section 1(a)_ of this Agreement without the
proof of any actual damage caused to Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Such
right to equitable relief is in addition to all other legal remedies Buyer or
any of its Affiliates may have to protect its rights.

  

## 

  

## (c) Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and expenses in any suit
or proceeding initiated in connection with this Agreement.

  

## 

  

# 4. **_Severability_**.  The covenants, provisions and paragraphs of this
Agreement are severable. In the event that any portion of this Agreement is
held to be illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the same will not
affect any other portion of this Agreement, and the remaining covenants,
provisions and paragraphs or portions thereof, to the extent enforceable,
shall, nevertheless, be binding and enforceable. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, if any durational or geographic restriction or
restriction on business activities covered under this Agreement shall be
found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be overly-broad, and thus
illegal or unenforceable, Seller and Buyer intend that such court will
enforce this Agreement in any less broad manner the court may find
appropriate by construing such overly-

  



        
   

  



  

# broad provisions to cover only that duration, geographic area or business
activities which may be enforceable.  The parties expressly agree that this
Agreement shall be given the construction that renders its provisions valid
and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law and/or equity.

  

# 

  

# 5. **_Amendments_**.  No supplement, modification, amendment or waiver of
the terms of this Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto unless
executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of

for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (the arbitrator selected hereunder,
the " _Arbitrator_ "). Provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be
sought by either party to this Agreement in a court of law while arbitration

such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by
the Arbitrator. Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may
include any remedy or relief which the Arbitrator deems just and equitable,

granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The
parties acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of
the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever
arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement or the provision
of services under this Agreement. The Employer will pay the arbitrators
fees and arbitration expenses and any other costs associated with the
arbitration or arbitration hearing that are unique to arbitration. Subject to

deposition, witness, expert and attorneys fees and other expenses as and to
the same extent as if the matter were being heard in court.

  



  

15. **_Representations/Warranties_**.

  



  

The Employee represents and warrants that he is under no contractual or other
obligation that would prevent him from accepting the Employers offer of
employment as set forth herein.

  



  

16. **_Entire Agreement_**.

  



  

This Agreement is intended by the parties to be the final expression of their
agreement with respect to the employment of the Employee by Employer and may
not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement
(including, without limitation any term sheet or similar agreement entered
into between Employer and the Employee). The parties further intend that
this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of its
terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any
judicial, administrative, or other legal proceeding to vary the terms of this
Agreement. Employer and Employee do hereby terminate, as they apply to
Employee, the effectiveness of the covenant not to compete and other
restrictions contained in Section 6.3 of that certain Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement dated effective October 20, 2005, by and among Employer,
Employee and certain of the other members of Employer.

  



        
   

  



  

17. **_No Representations_**.

  



  

No person or entity has made or has the authority to make any representations
or promises on behalf of any of the parties which are inconsistent with the
representations or promises contained in this Agreement, and this Agreement
has not been executed in reliance on any representations or promises not set
forth herein. Specifically, no promises, warranties or representations have
been made by anyone on any topic or subject matter related to the Employees
relationship with the Employer or any of their executives or employees,
including but not limited to any promises, warranties or representations
regarding future employment, compensation, benefits, any entitlement to
equity interests in Employer or regarding the termination of the Employees
employment. In this regard, the Employee agrees that no promises, warranties
or representations shall be deemed to be made in the future unless they are
set forth in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the
Employer.

  



  

18. **_Amendments_**.

  



  

This Agreement may be modified only by agreement of the parties by a written
instrument executed by the parties that is designated as an amendment to this
Agreement.

  



  

19. **_Severability and Non-Waiver/Survival_**.

  



  

Any provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) which is deemed invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction
and subject to this Section 19, be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the
remaining provisions thereof in such jurisdiction or rendering such provision
or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
in any other jurisdiction. If any covenant should be deemed invalid, illegal
or unenforceable because its scope is considered excessive, such covenant
shall be modified so that the scope of the covenant is reduced only to the
minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid, legal and
enforceable.  No waiver of any provision or violation of this Agreement by
the Employer shall be implied by the Employers forbearance or failure to
take action. The expiration or termination of the Employment Period and this
Agreement shall not impair the rights or obligations of any party hereto
which shall have accrued hereunder prior to such expiration or termination.

  



  

20. **_Successor/Assigns_**.

any or all of his rights or duties hereunder except following the prior
written consent of the Employer. The Employee shall be entitled, to the
extent permitted under applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or
beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder following the
Employees death by giving written notice thereof. In the event of the

in this Agreement to the Employee shall be deemed, where appropriate, to
refer to his beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.

The Employee represents and warrants that the Employee has read and
understands each and every provision of this Agreement and has freely and

 ** **

  

 ** _Pursuant to Section 151 of the 
 Delaware General Corporation Law_**

  



  

Primoris Services Corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, does, by its Secretary and under its
corporate seal, hereby certify that pursuant to the authority contained in
Article Fourth of its Certificate of Incorporation and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 151 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, its Board
of Directors has adopted the following resolution creating the following
class and series of the Corporations Preferred Stock and determining the
voting powers, designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, of such classes and series:

  



  

RESOLVED, that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors
by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the " _Certificate
of Incorporation_ "), there is hereby created the following series of
Preferred Stock:

  



  

*  shares shall be designated Series A Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_").

  



  

The designations, powers, preferences, and rights and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Stock in addition to
those set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation shall be as follows:

  



  

# Section 1. _Designation and Amount_.  shares
of the unissued preferred stock of the Corporation shall be designated as
Series A Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001
per share.

  

# 

  

# Section 2. _Definitions_.

  

# 

  

## (a) " _Board of Directors_ " means the Board of Directors of the Company
or any duly authorized committee thereof.

  

## 

  

## (b) " _Common Stock_ " means common stock of the Company.

  

## 

  

## (c) " _Stockholder Approval_ " means the approval by the stockholders of
the Company for the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Shares into Common Stock for purposes of Section 5635 of the NASDAQ
Stock Market Rules (or any successor provision).

  



        
   

  



  

# Section 3. _Dividends_. (a) So long as any shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, if the Company declares any dividend or
distribution of cash, securities (including rights, warrants, options or
evidences of indebtedness) or properties or assets other than shares of
Common Stock to be paid from time to time out of any assets legally available
for such payment (to the extent dividends or distributions consist of shares
of Common Stock an adjustment will be made pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof),
then the Company shall simultaneously declare a dividend or distribution on
shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the amount of dividends or
distributions that would be made with respect to shares of Series A Preferred
Stock if such shares were converted into shares of Common Stock on the record
date for such dividend or distribution (regardless of whether or not actual
conversion at such time would be permissible under Section 4 hereof). No
dividend or distribution shall be payable to holders of shares of Common
Stock unless the full dividends or distributions contemplated by this Section
are paid at the same time in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  

# 

  

## (a) Each dividend or distribution shall be payable to holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock as they appear in the records of the Company at the
close of business on the same record date as the record date for the payment
of the corresponding dividend or distribution to the holders of shares of
Common Stock.

  

## 

  

## (b) Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. If the
Company does not declare a dividend on the Common Stock or the Series A
Preferred Stock in respect of any period, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive any dividend for such dividend
period, and the Company shall have no obligation to pay a dividend for such
dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared and paid for any
future dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock or any other series of the Companys preferred stock.

  

## 

  

## (c) If the Conversion Date (as defined below) with respect to any of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock occurs prior to the record date for the
payment of any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock, the holder of
such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted shall not have the
right to receive any corresponding dividends or distributions on the Series A
Preferred Stock (but for the avoidance of doubt the holder thereof shall
receive that dividend or distribution payable to holders of Common Stock on
the relevant payment date if such holder is the holder of record of shares of
Common Stock on the record date for that dividend or distribution). If the
Conversion Date with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock occurs
after the record date for any declared dividend or distribution and prior to
the payment date for that dividend or distribution, the holder thereof shall
receive that dividend or distribution on the relevant payment date if such
holder of Common Stock was the holder of record of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock on the record date for that dividend or distribution.

  

# 

  

# Section 4. _Conversion_.

  

# 

  

## (a) The Company shall at all times maintain an agent for the purpose of
the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "
_Conversion Agent_ "), which may be an officer or agent of the Company.

  



        
   

  



  

## (b) If Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company shall promptly
instruct the Conversion Agent to convert into Common Stock, without further
action by any person, all then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock.

  

## 

  

## (c) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted in accordance
with this Section shall be converted into 100 shares of Common Stock, subject
to adjustment from time to time as described herein (the " _Conversion Rate_
").

  

## 

  

# Section 5. _Conversion Procedures_.

  

# 

  

## (a) In the event of an automatic conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 4, the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent, and
provided further that the Company shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
automatic conversion unless the certificates formerly evidencing such shares
of Series A Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that
such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed and executes an
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Company shall, as
soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and
indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such
office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder
shall be entitled as aforesaid; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such delivery of certificates formerly
representing the Series A Preferred Stock or of agreement and indemnification
in the case of a lost certificate, the Company may determine that the shares
of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be uncertificated, in which case the Company or its transfer agent will
make the appropriate entries into the records of the Company and the Company
shall not be obligated to issue a stock certificate for such shares of Common
Stock.

  

## 

  

## (b) Effective immediately upon conversion of any share of Series
A Preferred Stock, dividends shall no longer be declared on any such
converted share of Series A Preferred Stock and such share of Series
A Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case, subject to
the right of the holder of Series A Preferred Stock to receive any
declared and unpaid dividends on such share to the extent provided herein and
any other payments to which such holder is otherwise entitled hereunder.

  

## 

  

## (c) No allowance or adjustment, except as expressly provided herein, shall
be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of the Common Stock of
record as of any date prior to the close of business on the date any share of
Series A Preferred Stock is converted (the " _Conversion Date_ ") with
respect to any share of Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to the close of
business on the Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series
A Preferred Stock, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof
shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and the holder of such share
of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to
tender offers for the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon
conversion and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the
Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion) by virtue of
holding such share of Series A Preferred Stock.

  



        
   

  



  

## (d) The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as
the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and/or securities as of
the close of business on the Conversion Date with respect thereto. In the
event that a holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which
shares of Common Stock, securities or other property to be issued or paid
upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock should be registered or
paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Company
shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment,
in the name of the holder and in the manner shown on the records of the
Company.

  

## 

  

## (e) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock. All fractions shall be rounded up to the nearest share. If more than
one share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at
one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of
the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered.

  

## 

  

## (f) The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue
or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of
Common Stock on the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to Section 4 and this Section; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any
registration or transfer involved in the issue or delivery of Common Stock in
a name other than that of the registered holder of Series A Preferred Stock
converted or to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made
unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the
amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Company, that such tax has been paid.

  

## 

  

# Section 6. _Adjustments_.

  

# 

  

## (a) If the Company shall (i) pay a dividend or make any other distribution
with respect to its Common Stock which consists in whole or in part of shares
of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify its Common Stock into a
greater number of shares or (iii) combine or reclassify its Common Stock into
a lesser number of shares, then in each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted (regardless of whether or not actual
conversion at such time would be permissible under Section 4 hereof) so that
a holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock thereafter converted shall
be entitled to receive the number and kind of other securities that such
holder of Series A Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to
receive after the happening of such dividend, subdivision, combination, or
other reclassification had such shares of Series A Preferred Stock been
converted immediately prior to the happening of such reclassification or any
record date with respect thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section
shall become effective on the date of the dividend payment, subdivision,
combination or issuance and shall be applied from the record date with
respect thereto, if any, for such event. Such adjustment shall be made
successively.

  



        
   

  



  

## (b) If the Company shall be a party to any transaction, including a
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Companys
assets, reorganization, liquidation or recapitalization of the Common Stock
(each of the foregoing being referred to as a " _Transaction_ "), in each
case as a result of which shares of Common Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive stock, securities or other property (including cash or
any combination thereof), then, in connection with such Transaction, the
Company shall make provision for the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted
into the amount of shares of stock and other securities and the right to
receive the property receivable (including cash) by a holder of that number
of shares of Common Stock into which one share of Series A Preferred Stock
was convertible immediately prior to such Transaction (regardless of whether
or not actual conversion into Common Stock at such time would be permissible
under Section 4 hereof) and upon consummation of the Transaction the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into such amount of stock
and other securities and the right to receive property at the same time and
in the same manner as the Common Stock is so converted (or as promptly as
practicable thereafter). Any shares of stock and other securities and
property shall be payable to the holder upon surrender of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock or as otherwise provided for as if such delivery
were of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(a). The Company shall not be a
party to any Transaction unless the terms of such Transaction are consistent
with the provisions of this Section.

  

## 

  

## (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case in which this Section
provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record
date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event
issuing to the holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted
after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to
such adjustment.

  

## 

  

## (d) If the Company shall take any action affecting the shares of Common
Stock, other than any action described in this Section, which in the
reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors would adversely affect
the conversion rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, then
the number of shares of Common Stock that a share of Series A Preferred Stock
is convertible into immediately before such action shall be adjusted, to
the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, in such manner and at
such time as the Board of Directors may determine in good faith to be
equitable in the circumstances. Any such determinations shall be memorialized
in writing and shall be maintained on file at the Companys principal
executive office and shall be made available to any stockholder upon request.

  

## 

  

## (e) Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible is adjusted as herein provided, the
chief financial officer of the Company or his or her designee(s) shall
compute the required adjustment in accordance with the foregoing provisions
and shall prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in
reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. A copy of
such certificate shall be filed promptly with the Conversion Agent and mailed
to each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at such holders last
address as shown on the stock books of the Company.

  



        
   

  



  

## (f) The Company shall not, without the consent of a majority of the shares
of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class,
make a publicly-announced tender offer for its Common Stock unless the
Company provides to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock the right to
participate in the tender offer on the same terms and conditions as holders
of Common Stock, provided that any Series A Preferred Stock tendered shall
receive, upon surrender of the Series A Preferred Stock to the Company, the
consideration payable with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the Series A Preferred Stock so tendered would be convertible at
the time immediately prior to the consummation of the tender offer
(regardless of whether or not actual conversion at such time would be
permissible under Section 4 hereof).

  

## 

  

# Section 7. _Reservation of Common Stock_.

  

# 

  

## (a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from
all liens, charges and security interests and not subject to any preemptive
rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock or its issued shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, or both,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Series A Preferred
Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock then deliverable upon the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

  

## 

  

## (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to
deliver upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as herein
provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Company (in lieu of the
issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any
such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security
interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and
other encumbrances created by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock).

  

## 

  

## (c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other
encumbrances and not subject to any preemptive rights (other than liens,
charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the holders the
Series A Preferred Stock).

  

## 

  

## (d) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the
Common Stock shall be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or any other national
securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company shall, if
permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list
and keep listed, all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the rules of such
exchange or automated quotation system permit the Company to defer
the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series
A Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof,
the Company covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such
exchange or automated quotation system at such time.

  



        
   

  



  

# Section 8. _Liquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up_.

  

# 

  

## (a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
then outstanding shall first be entitled to receive out of the available
assets of the Company, whether such assets are stated capital or surplus of
any nature, an amount on such date equal to $100.00 per share of Series A
Preferred Stock, plus the amount of any declared but unpaid dividends thereon
to and including the date of such liquidation, out of assets legally
available for distribution to the Companys stockholders before any
distribution of assets is made to the holders of Common Stock. After payment
to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the amounts set forth in
preceding sentence, the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company
legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among the
holders of the Common Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to
the shares of Common Stock then held by them and the shares of Common Stock
which they then have the right to acquire upon conversion of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock then held by them (regardless of whether or not
actual conversion at such time would be permissible under Section 4 hereof).

  

## 

  

## (b) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to
stockholders upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs
of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to
pay in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall share
ratably in any distribution of assets of the Company in proportion to the
full respective liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled.

  

## 

  

## (c) The Companys consolidation or merger with or into any other entity,
the consolidation or merger of any other entity with or into the Company, or
the sale of all or substantially all of the Companys property or business
shall not constitute its liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

  

## 

  

# Section 9. _Maturity_. The Series A Preferred Stock shall be perpetual
unless converted in accordance with this Certificate of Designation.

  

# 

  

# Section 10. _No Redemption; No Sinking Fund_.

  

# 

  

## (a) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to
redemption by the Company or at the option of any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may purchase or
otherwise acquire outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock by mutual
agreement with any holder or holders thereof.

  

## 

  

## (b) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to or
entitled to the operation of a retirement or sinking fund.

  

## 

  

# Section 11. _Voting Rights_.

  

# 

  

## (a) Except as expressly provided in this Section and in Section 6(f) or as
otherwise required by applicable law or regulation, holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights.

  



        
   

  



  

## (b) So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding,
the Company shall not, without the consent or vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, amend, alter or repeal or otherwise change (including
in connection with any merger or consolidation or otherwise) any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or this Certificate of
Designation, if such amendment would increase the authorized shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock or alter or change the powers, preferences or
special rights of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect
the Series A Preferred Stock adversely.

  

## 

  

# Section 12. _Exclusion of Other Rights_. Except as may otherwise be
required by law or specifically set forth in this Certificate of Designation
and the Certificate of Incorporation, as they may be amended from time to
time, the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any other powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights.

  

# 

  

# Section 13. _Severability of Provisions_. If any voting powers, preferences
and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the Series
A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof
set forth in this Certificate of Designation are invalid, unlawful or
incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy,
all other voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional
and other special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof set forth in this Certificate of
Designation that can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or
unenforceable voting powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof shall, nevertheless,
remain in full force and effect, and no voting powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the Series A
Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof
herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other such voting powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
the Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof unless so expressed herein.

  

# 

  

# Section 14. _Reissuance of Series A Preferred Stock_. Shares of Series A
Preferred Stock that have been duly converted into Common Stock or otherwise
reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased by the Company or
exchanged or converted, shall not be reissued as Series A Preferred Stock and
shall upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State
of Delaware have the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred
stock of the Company undesignated as to series. The Company may from time to
time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

  

# 

  

# Section 15. _Mutilated or Missing Series A Preferred Stock Certificates_.
If any certificate representing any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock

certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent amount of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock of the same class, but only upon receipt of evidence
of such loss, theft or destruction of such certificate and indemnity, if
requested, satisfactory to the Company and the transfer agent (if other than
the Company).

  



        
   

  



  

# Section 16. _Fractional Shares_. The Series A Preferred Stock may be issued
in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such
holders fractional shares, to receive dividends, participate in dividends
and distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock, including the conversion provisions provided in
Section 4.

 **SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT**

  

 ** **

  

The undersigned is a creditor (the "Creditor") of Primoris Services
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). In consideration of
loans made or to be made, credit given or to be given, or other financial
accommodations afforded or to be afforded to the Company, on such terms as
may be agreed upon between **THE PRIVATEBANK AND TRUST COMPANY** (the "Bank")
and the Company, the Creditor agrees that all monetary obligations of the
Company to the Creditor except for (i) wages earned and (ii) other payments
(such as reimbursements and appropriate bonuses) to be made in the ordinary
course of the Companys business and (iii) all obligations of the Company
under the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement by and among the Company,
the undersigned and other Sellers dated effective October , 2009 (the
"Purchase Agreement") except as evidenced by the Promissory Note
(collectively, except for the excluded items described in (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, the "Subordinated Indebtedness") now existing or hereafter arising
and howsoever evidenced or acquired (the aggregate principal amount of
such Subordinated Indebtedness as of the date hereof being that amount
outstanding pursuant to that certain Promissory Note, in form attached hereto
as **EXHIBIT A** , in the face amount of fifty-three million five hundred
thousand Dollars ($53,500,000) (the "Promissory Note") of the Company payable
to the Creditor) shall be and remain junior and subordinate to any and all
obligations of the Company to the Bank ("Superior Indebtedness") now existing
or hereafter arising, whether direct or indirect, secured or unsecured,
absolute or contingent, joint and several, and howsoever owned, or acquired.

  



  

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Creditor further agrees
with the Bank as follows:

  



  

1(a). Except as provided in Section 1(b), so long as there is any "Default",
whether technical or monetary, on any Superior Indebtedness no payment of
principal or interest (notwithstanding the expressed maturity or any time for
the payment of principal on the

  



        
   

  



  

Promissory Note) shall be made on the Promissory Note except with Banks
prior written consent and the Creditor will take no steps, whether by suit or
otherwise to compel or enforce the collection of the Promissory Note, nor
will the Creditor use the Promissory Note by way of counterclaim, set off,
recoupment or otherwise as to diminish, discharge or otherwise satisfy in
whole or in part any indebtedness or liability of the Creditor to the
Company.

  



  

# **1(b). U**pon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default
under the Promissory Note, the Creditor shall not be entitled to accelerate
outstanding obligations payable by the Company until 180 days after the date
that the Event of Default was triggered.

  

# ** **

  

1(c). The Company may, however, pay scheduled principal (including scheduled
prepayments of principal) and interest on the Promissory Note as outlined in
paragraph #2 of the Promissory Note without obtaining written consent of the
Bank, so long as no event of Default on Superior Indebtedness has occurred,
or will occur as a result of such payment, and notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 1(d) Creditor need not give Bank notice of such payments..

  



  

1(d). The Creditor must provide the Bank with notice prior to a draw on the
Subordinated Note.

  



  

2. The Bank need not at any time give the Creditor notice of any kind of the creation or existence of any Superior Indebtedness, nor of the amount or terms thereof, all such notice being hereby expressly waived. Also, the Bank may at any time from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Creditor, without incurring responsibility to the Creditor, and without impairing or releasing the obligation of the Creditor under this agreement (i) renew, refund or extend the maturity of any Superior Indebtedness, or any part thereof, or otherwise revise, amend or alter the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property by whomsoever at any time pledged, mortgaged or otherwise hypothecated or subjected to a lien to secure any Superior Indebtedness, and (iii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and others, including the Creditor.

  



        
   

  



  

3. The Creditor without prior written consent will not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or hypothecate any Subordinated Indebtedness, or any part thereof, or agree to discharge or forgiveness of the same so long as there remains any Superior Indebtedness except subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof and upon the agreement of the transferee or assignee to abide by and be bound by the terms hereof.

  



  

4. The Bank shall provide the Creditor with immediate notice upon an Event of Default under the Superior Indebtedness. Upon receipt of such notice, the Creditor shall not accept any payments from the Company on the Subordinated Indebtedness. If the Company does make a payment to the Creditor in violation of the prohibition herein, all funds, the value of any property and any benefit received by the Creditor in connection with such payment shall be returned to the Company immediately upon demand by the Bank.

  



  

5. The Creditor will cause all Subordinated Indebtedness to be at all times evidenced by the Promissory Note or notes of the Company and will cause all such notes to bear thereon a legend substantially as follows:

  



  

"The indebtedness evidenced by this Note is subordinate to any and all
indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of the maker hereof to  **THE
PRIVATEBANK AND TRUST COMPANY**  in the manner and to the extent set forth in
that certain Subordination Agreement with said Bank dated
, to which reference is hereby made for a more full statement thereof. The
holder has agreed thereby without said Banks written consent not to sell,
assign, transfer, pledge or hypothecate this Note."

  



  

6. This Subordination Agreement shall be continuing and binding until written notice of its discontinuance shall be actually received by you, and also shall continue to remain in full force and effect until all Superior Indebtedness created or existing prior to the receipt of such notice shall have been fully paid and satisfied.

  



        
   

  



  

Each and all of the promises herein contained shall be binding on the
Creditor, his or her heirs, legal representatives and assigns, and shall
inure to your benefit and the benefit of your successors and assigns.

    |  



    
     



    |

Contractor  and Creditor desire Surety to furnish Bonds as requested by

 **III.** ** ****COVENANTS:**

  



  

In consideration of the furnishing of any such Bonds by Surety, Contractor
and Creditor hereby agree as follows:

  



       

1.

    |  

Creditor  hereby subordinates all rights and claims against Contractor on
account of  the above mentioned indebtedness to any and all rights and claims
of Surety  on account of Loss as defined herein. Loss shall mean any and all
loss or  expense of whatever kind, including interest, court costs and
counsel fees  which Surety incurs or sustains as a result of or in connection
with any Bond  furnished by Surety. Originals or photocopies of claim drafts,
or of payment  records kept in the ordinary course of business, including
computer  print-outs, verified by affidavit, shall be prima facie evidence of
the fact  and amount of Suretys loss and Surety shall be entitled to
reimbursement for  any and all disbursements made by it in good faith, under
the belief that it  was liable, or that such disbursement was necessary or
expedient.

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

2.

    |  

Suretys  Loss shall be paid in full out of the assets of the Contractor
before any  payment on account of the above mentioned indebtedness is made to
or realized  by Creditor.

    
     



    |  



    
     

3.

    |  

Creditor  hereby assigns to Surety all of its rights and claims, including
its  security, if any, on account of such indebtedness so that in the event
of  receivership, bankruptcy or insolvency of Contractor, Surety may enforce
such  rights and claims and may have dividends thereon until Surety is
reimbursed  in full for its Loss.

    
     



    |  



    
     

4.

    |  

Unless  specifically permitted in paragraph 11 below or Surety provides its
express  written consent, Creditor and Contractor agree that until Surety has
been  provided with competent legal evidence of the release or exoneration of
each  and every Bond, the mentioned indebtedness shall remain unchanged and 
unliquidated; that neither Creditor nor Contractor will by act or omission 
procure or permit the reduction of such indebtedness; nor will Creditor
sell,  transfer or hypothecate said indebtedness.

    
     



    |  



    
     

5.

    |  

Creditor  agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the terms of this
Agreement,  all funds, the value of any property and any benefit received by
Creditor in  connection with such breach shall be returned by Creditor to
Contractor upon  Suretys demand. Contractor further agrees to compensate
Surety for any  damage the Surety sustained that was caused by or contributed
to by any  breach of the Agreement, including, but not limited to any breach
of the  Agreement by Creditor.

    
     



    |  



    
     

6.

    |  

This  Agreement shall apply to Bonds heretofore or hereafter executed and
furnished  by Surety, procured by Surety, or executed by any other surety as
sole surety  or as co-surety, and the rights hereunder shall inure to the
benefit of  Surety, such other surety, if any, and their reinsurers, if any.

    
     



    |  



    
     

7.

    |  

This  Agreement shall apply to Bonds executed both before and after the
effective  date of this Agreement including any alterations, renewals,
extensions and  modifications thereof.

    
     



    |  



    
     

8.

    |  

The  Suretys ability to exercise any particular right or remedy under this 
Agreement, shall not be prejudiced by either a delay or failure to exercise 
such right or remedy. The obligations of the Creditor and Contractor 
hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, their obligations to 
the Surety under any other agreements, including but not limited to the 
General Agreement of Indemnity executed in favor of the Surety, and in the 
event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement 
and the terms of any other agreements, the term or interpretation most 
favorable to the Surety, as determined by the Surety, shall control.
Creditor  and Contractor further acknowledge each has been provided with an
opportunity  to consult its own counsel prior to execution hereof.

    
     



    |  



    
     

9.

    |  

Notwithstanding  this Agreement, Surety has no obligation to issue Bonds
requested by  Contractor or Creditor.

    
     



    |  



    
     

10.

    |  

This  Agreement may not be terminated without the prior written consent of
all  parties hereto. In the event that all liability under the Bonds issued
to  Contractor has been extinguished, in the sole and absolute discretion of
the  Surety, Surety shall not withhold its consent to terminate this
Agreement.

    
     



    |  



    
     

11.

    |  

NOTWITHSTANDING  the foregoing provisions, Contractor shall be entitled to
make and Creditor  shall be entitled to receive, until the entire debt is
paid in lawful money  of the United States of America: a) installments no
greater than the normally  scheduled principal and interest amounts as set
forth in the Promissory Note;  and b) prepayments or accelerated payments, as
set forth in  2.1(a)(i) and 2.1(a)(ii) of the Promissory Note. In the event
that  Contractor desires to make and Creditor desires to receive any other 
prepayment or accelerated payment including but not limited to the
prepayment  set forth in 2.1(a)(iii) (hereinafter "Qualified Debt
Prepayment"), the  Contractor and/or Creditor must provide Surety with 30
days prior written  notice sent by certified mail (Surety Notice") of its

 ** **

  

A. As of _[Closing Date]_ , the Company, the Target, the members of Target

B. As of the date hereof, each Stockholder owns beneficially and has the
right to vote (including shares subject to a proxy provided to Brian Pratt)
or to direct the vote of the number of shares of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), as set forth
opposite such Stockholders name on _Exhibit A_ hereto (all such shares and
any shares of which beneficial ownership and the right to vote or to direct
the vote of that are hereafter acquired by any of the Stockholders, whether
by purchase, conversion, exercise or otherwise, prior to the termination of
this Agreement are referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ").

  



  

C. As a condition to the consummation of the Purchase Agreement, the
Stockholders have agreed to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

 ** _A G R E E M E N T_**

  

 ** **

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements
and covenants set forth herein and in the Purchase Agreement, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. **_Voting of Shares_**.

  



  

1.1 **_Obligation to Vote in Favor of the Conversion of the Buyer Shares_**.
During the term of this Agreement, each Stockholder agrees to vote (or cause
to be voted) the Shares over which he or it has the right to vote or to
direct the vote of, in favor of the conversion of the Buyer Shares to Company
Common Stock at any meeting of the holders of the Company Common Stock,
however called, or in connection with any written consent of the holders of
the Company Common Stock.

  



        
   

  



  

1.2 **_Term of Agreement_**. The obligations of the Stockholders pursuant to
this Agreement shall terminate immediately following the date
the stockholders of the Company approve the conversion of the Buyer Shares
to Company Common Stock at any meeting of the holders of the Company Common
Stock, however called, or by written consent.

  



  

1.3 **_Obligations as Director and/or Officer_**. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or restrict any director or officer of the Company
from acting in his or her capacity as such director or officer or from
exercising his or her fiduciary duties and responsibilities, it being agreed
and understood that this Agreement shall apply to each Stockholder solely in
his or her capacity as a Stockholder of the Company and shall not apply to
his or her actions, judgments or decisions as a director or officer of the
Company if he or she is such a director or officer.

  



  

1.4 **_Disclosure_**. The Stockholders hereby agree that the Company is
permitted to publish and disclose in the Proxy Statement and any other form,
document or schedule filed with the SEC, and any press release or other
disclosure document which Buyer and Sellers reasonably determine to
be necessary or desirable in connection with the Purchase Agreement and
any transactions related thereto, the Stockholders identity and ownership of
the Shares and the nature of the Stockholders commitments, arrangements
and understandings under this Agreement.

  



  

1.5 **_Transfer_**. No Stockholder shall transfer any Shares if such transfer
will result in an excess of 200,000 shares of Company Common Stock, in
aggregate, being sold by the Stockholders after the date hereof unless the
transferee agrees in writing to be bound to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

  



  

2. **_Representations and Warranties; Covenants of the Stockholders_**. Each Stockholder hereby severally represents warrants and covenants as follows:

  



  

2.1 **_Authorization_**. Such Stockholder has full legal capacity
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out such
Stockholders obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by such Stockholder, and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, the Sellers and the other Stockholders) this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

2.2 **_No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_**.

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not, (i)
conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to such Stockholder or by which
any property or asset of such Stockholder is bound or affected, or (ii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of any encumbrance on any property or asset of such
Stockholder, including, without limitation, the Shares, pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or
foreign, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities
Exchange Act, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not prevent or materially delay the performance by such Stockholder of such
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

2.3 **_Title to Shares_**. Such Stockholder is the legal and beneficial owner
of its Shares, free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances
except certain restrictions upon the transfer of such Shares.

3.7 **_Arbitration_**. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in Harris County, Texas.

  



  

(a) **_Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services_**. The arbitration shall
be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (" _JAMS_ ")
in its Harris office.

  



  

(b) **_Arbitrator_**. The arbitrator shall be a retired superior or appellate

(c) **_Provisional Remedies and Appeals_**. Each of the parties reserves the
right to file with a court of competent jurisdiction an application for
temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, writ of attachment, writ of
possession, temporary protective order and/or appointment of a receiver on
the grounds that the arbitration award to which the applicant may be entitled
may be rendered ineffectual in the absence of such relief.  The award of the
arbitrator shall be binding, final, and nonappealable.

  



  

(d) **_Enforcement of Judgment_**. Judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
award of the arbitrator shall be binding, final, and nonappealable.

  



  

(e) **_Discovery_**. The parties may obtain discovery in aid of the
arbitration to the fullest extent permitted under law. All discovery disputes
shall be resolved by the arbitrator.

  



  

(f) **_Consolidation_**. Any arbitration hereunder may be consolidated by
JAMS with the arbitration of any other dispute arising out of or relating
to the same subject matter when the arbitrator determines that there is a
common issue of law or fact creating the possibility of conflicting rulings
by more than one arbitrator. Any disputes over which arbitrator shall hear
any consolidated matter shall be resolved by JAMS.

  



  

(g) **_Power and Authority of Arbitrator_**. The arbitrator shall not have any
power to alter, amend, modify or change any of the terms of this Agreement
nor to grant any remedy which is either prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement, or not available in a court of law.

  



  

(h) **_Governing Law_**. All questions in respect of procedure to be followed
in conducting the arbitration as well as the enforceability of this Agreement
to arbitrate which may be resolved by state law shall be resolved according
to the law of the state of Delaware.  Any action brought to enforce the
provisions of this Section shall be brought in the Harris County Superior
Court.  All other questions in respect to this Agreement, including but
not limited to the interpretation, enforcement of this Agreement (other than
the right to arbitrate), and the rights, duties and liabilities of the
parties to this Agreement shall be governed by Delaware law.

  



  

(i) **_Costs_**. The costs of the arbitration, including any JAMS
administration fee, and arbitrators fee, and costs of the use of facilities
during the hearings, shall be borne equally by the parties in the first
instance. Upon issuance of an award, costs shall be awarded to the prevailing
party.

  



        
   

  



  

3.8 **_Attorneys  Fees_**. If a party to this Agreement shall bring
any action, suit, counterclaim, appeal, arbitration, or mediation for any
relief against the other parties, declaratory or otherwise, to enforce the
terms hereof or to declare rights hereunder (referred to herein as an "
_Action_ "), the non-prevailing party in such Action shall pay to the
prevailing party in such Action a reasonable sum for the prevailing partys
attorneys fees and expenses (at the prevailing partys attorneys then-
current rates, as increased from time to time by the giving of advance
written notice by such counsel to such party) incurred in prosecuting or
defending such Action and/or enforcing any judgment, order, ruling or award
(referred to herein as a " _Decision_ "), granted therein, all of which shall
be deemed to have accrued from the commencement of such Action, and shall be
paid whether or not such Action is prosecuted to a Decision. Any
Decision entered into in such Action shall contain a specific provision
providing for the recovery of attorneys fees and expenses incurred in
enforcing such Decision. The court or arbitrator may fix the amount of
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses upon the request of any party. For
purposes of this Section, attorneys fees shall include, without limitation,
fees incurred in connection with (1) postjudgment motions and collection
actions, (2) contempt proceedings, (3) garnishment, levy and debtor and third
party examination, (4) discovery and (5) bankruptcy litigation.

  



  

3.9 **_Submission to Jurisdiction_**. Subject to the provisions of Section
3.7 above, each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal court sitting in the State of Texas, County of Harris, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that
all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety, or other security that might be required of the other Party with
respect thereto.  Either Party may make service on the other Party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.7 of
the Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.9, however, shall affect
the right of either Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law or at equity. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at equity.

  



  

3.10 **_No Waiver_**. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by law.

  



  

3.11 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

3.12 **_Purchase Agreement_**. All references to the Purchase
Agreement herein shall be to such agreement as may be amended by the parties
thereto from time to time.

  



        
   

  



  

3.13 **_Certain Events_**. The Stockholders agree that this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon
any person to which legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares shall pass,
whether by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation, any
such Stockholders spouses, trustees, beneficiaries, heirs,
guardians, administrators or successors.  Notwithstanding any such transfer
of Shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all
obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement and the obligations
hereunder, so long as any Stockholder is an individual, will survive the
death, incompetency and disability of such Stockholder or any other
individual holder of the Shares, so long as any Stockholder is an entity,
will survive the merger or reorganization of such Stockholder, so long as any
Stockholder is a trust, will survive the dissolution of such Stockholder.
