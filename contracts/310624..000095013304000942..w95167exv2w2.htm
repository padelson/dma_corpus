Security Interests, except Permitted Encumbrances:  

 2.1.1 all contracts and other arrangements relating to the Business pursuant to which Arrow is providing goods and/or services, and all proposals, bids and offers for future such contracts and arrangements, including the contracts and other arrangements, proposals, bids and offers listed on  _Schedule 2.1.1_ (the " _Dagger Engagements_ ");   

 2.1.2 all contracts and other arrangements pursuant to which Arrow formerly provided goods and/or services relating to the Business, excluding the contracts and other arrangements listed on _Schedule 2.1.2_ (the " _Dagger Completed Engagements_ ");   

 2.1.3 all other contracts relating to the Business and to which Arrow is a party, including employment agreements, nondisclosure agreements, teaming agreements, joint ventures, joint marketing agreements, consulting agreements and subcontracts (the " _Dagger Contracts_ "), but excluding the Dagger Leases, regardless of whether Arrow has obtained any necessary consents to the assignment of such Dagger Contracts;

 2.1.9 all of Arrows accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable and work-in-process that relate to the Business (the " _Dagger Receivables_ " and the " _Dagger Work-In-Process,_ " respectively);   

 2.1.10 all books, papers, ledgers, documents and records relating to the Dagger Assets, including all records and documents relating to the Dagger Engagements, the Dagger Contracts, the Dagger Receivables, the Dagger Work-In-Process and the Dagger Obligations (provided that Arrow may retain copies of such books, papers, ledgers, documents and records), as well as complete copies of all other books, papers, ledgers, documents and records relating to the Dagger Assets.     #####

 2.1.14 all of Arrows capital stock and other voting interests in the Dagger Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Dagger Subsidiary Shares_ ").   

 2.2 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, no interest of Arrow in or to the assets listed on _Schedule 2.2_ (the " _Excluded Assets_ ") is being sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to Acquisition Sub.  

 2.3 Assumption of Specified Obligations . At the Closing, Acquisition Sub shall agree to assume and perform after the Closing when and as they become due the obligations and liabilities of Arrow related to the Business, including the following (the " _Dagger Obligations_ "):  

 2.3.1 Arrows accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue relating to the Business through the Closing Date, such amounts to be calculated in a manner consistent with the Dagger Balance Sheet for the Reported Business, except that such amounts shall be for the Business.   

 2.3.2 Arrows obligations after the Closing under the Dagger Engagements, the Dagger Completed Engagements, the Dagger Contracts and the Dagger Leases; and   

 2.3.3 Arrows liabilities to Dagger Employees that are not covered by insurance held by Arrow or Crossbow, whether or not such persons actually become employees of Acquisition Sub.   

 Except for the Dagger Obligations, Acquisition Sub is assuming no liabilities or obligations of Arrow in connection with this transaction, including (a) any liability or obligation of Arrow to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (b) any liability or obligation of Arrow to any director, officer, employee or other agent of Arrow (other than the Dagger Employees), (c) any liability or obligation of Arrow under any contract, agreement or arrangement relating to the Business or the conduct thereof other than the Dagger Engagements, the Dagger Completed Engagements, the Dagger Contracts and the Dagger Leases, (d) any trade or practice liabilities or obligations of Arrow, (e) any liability or obligation of Arrow to any current, former or deceased employee of Arrow or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Dagger Subsidiaries), other than the Dagger Employees, (f) any liability or obligation of Arrow or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Dagger Subsidiaries) under any Employee Benefit Plan, or (g) any liability of Arrow for Taxes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Arrow and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of the Dagger Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for payment and performance of all liabilities, obligations and amounts at any time owing by any of them before or after the Closing Date, whether direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, known or unknown, other than the Dagger Obligations.   ##### 

 

 The parties to this Agreement intend that any Liability of Arrow that is based on, or arises out of, facts or circumstances that existed prior to the Closing Date and is not primarily related to the Business shall not be assumed by Acquisition Sub and shall not be or become a Dagger Obligation except as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Liability of Arrow that is not primarily related to the Business shall be allocated or divided between the Business, on the one hand, and the business and operations being acquired by Crossbow and Merger Sub, on the other hand, unless expressly provided herein.  

 The parties understand that Arrow will not assume the liabilities of the Dagger Subsidiaries, but that such liabilities shall be retained by the Dagger Subsidiaries.  

 2.4 Purchase Price. The purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") to be paid by Acquisition Sub for the Dagger Assets shall be Four Hundred Fifteen Million Dollars ($415,000,000), subject to adjustment as provided below in Section 2.8. The payment of the Purchase Price shall be made in immediately available funds wired to one or more accounts designated by Arrow or by such other method as may be agreed by Arrow and Acquisition Sub.  

 2.5 Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Dagger Assets (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Arnold and Porter LLP in McLean, Virginia, commencing at 9 a.m. local time on such date that is the first business day immediately following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing Date_ ").  

 2.6 Instruments of Transfer. Arrow shall effect the transfer of the Dagger Assets and the Dagger Obligations to Acquisition Sub at the Closing by such bills of sale, assignments, assumptions and other instruments of transfer as Acquisition Sub or its counsel deem necessary or appropriate to transfer full legal and beneficial title to the Dagger Assets free and clear of all Security Interests whatsoever except Permitted Encumbrances, and to transfer full responsibility for the Dagger Obligations. As appropriate, such documents shall contain customary warranties and covenants of title and shall be in form and substance acceptable to Acquisition Sub and its counsel.  

 2.7 Additional Actions. At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, (a) at the reasonable request of Acquisition Sub, Arrow shall execute and deliver to Acquisition Sub such other instruments of transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation and take such action as Acquisition Sub may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to transfer, convey and assign to Acquisition Sub and to confirm Acquisition Subs title to any of assets primarily utilized in connection with the performance and technical and administrative support of the Business inadvertently left in the control or possession of Arrow and all instruments, undertakings or other documents and take such other action as Acquisition Sub may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to have Arrow fully assume and be liable for any Liabilities of Arrow that are not Dagger Obligations and that were inadvertently assumed by Acquisition Sub, and (b) at the reasonable request of Arrow, Acquisition Sub shall execute and deliver to Arrow such other instruments of transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation and take such action as Arrow may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to transfer, convey and assign to Arrow and to confirm Arrows title to any of the Excluded Assets inadvertently transferred to Acquisition Sub and all instruments, undertakings or other   ##### 

 

documents and take such other action as Arrow may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable in order to have Acquisition Sub fully assume and be liable for
any Dagger Obligations that were inadvertently retained by Arrow.  

 Prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, if either Crossbow or Acquisition Sub shall determine that an asset or liability of the Business was inappropriately included in or excluded from the definition of either the Dagger Assets or the Dagger Obligations, the party that makes such determination shall so advise the other party and Crossbow and Acquisition Sub shall in good faith endeavor to reach agreement with respect to such asset or liability.  

 If a dispute arises under this Section 2.7, then within three (3) business days after a written request by either party, Federals President and Crossbows President of U.S. Operations shall promptly confer to resolve the dispute. If such persons cannot resolve such dispute, or either one of them determines that they are not making reasonable progress toward resolution of the dispute within the five (5) business day period immediately following the delivery of the written notice described above, then such dispute shall be settled by arbitration in the City of New York in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney expert in the area of mergers and acquisitions, selected by Crossbow and Acquisition Sub (or, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within five (5) business days of commencing arbitration, such an expert selected by the Association). Judgment upon the award rendered under any such arbitration may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction thereof.  

 2.8 Adjustment to Purchase Price  

 2.8.1 Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (but not later than 60 days thereafter), Arrow shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall deliver to Acquisition Sub a Closing Balance Sheet for the Business as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ").   

 2.8.2 Review of Closing Balance Sheet. Acquisition Sub, upon receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, shall (a) review the Closing Balance Sheet and (b) to the extent Acquisition Sub may deem necessary, make reasonable inquiry of Arrow and its accountants, relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. Acquisition Sub and its employees and advisors shall have full access upon prior written notice and during normal business hours to the books, papers and records of Arrow and its accountants (if any are used), relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet in connection with such inquiry and the preparation of any objections thereto (" _Objections_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Acquisition Sub unless Acquisition Sub shall have notified Arrow in writing of any Objections thereto within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. Acquisition Sub shall make the Dagger Employees and books and records of the Business available to Arrow as necessary for Arrow to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet.   

 2.8.3 Disputes. In the event of Objections, Arrow shall have 20 days to review and respond to such Objections, and Acquisition Sub and Arrow shall attempt to resolve     ##### 

    

the differences underlying such Objections within 20 days
following completion of Arrows review of such Objections. Disputes between
Acquisition Sub and Arrow which cannot be resolved by them within such 20-day
period shall be referred no later than such 20th day for decision to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or to a nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm mutually selected by the Acquisition Sub and Arrow (the "
_Auditor_ ") (which firm shall not be any of (a) the independent public
accountants of Parent, Federal and Acquisition Sub, (b) the independent
public accountants used by Arrow prior to the Closing Date and (c) the
independent public accountants of Crossbow), who shall act as arbitrator and
determine, based solely on presentations by Acquisition Sub and Arrow and
only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to
what extent, if any, the Closing Balance Sheet requires adjustment. The
Auditor shall deliver its written determination to Acquisition Sub and Arrow
no later than the 30th day after the remaining differences underlying such
Objections are referred to the Auditor, or such longer period of time as the
Auditor reasonably determines is necessary. The Auditors determination shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and disbursements of the
Auditor shall be allocated equally between Acquisition Sub and Arrow.
Acquisition Sub and Arrow shall make readily available to the Auditor all
relevant information, books and records and any work papers relating to the
Closing Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably requested by the
Auditor. In no event may the Auditors resolution of any difference be for an
amount which is outside the range of Acquisition Subs and Arrows
disagreement.  

 2.8.4 Final Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet shall become final and binding upon the parties upon the earliest of (a) Acquisition Subs failure to object thereto within the period permitted under Section 2.8.2, (b) the agreement between Acquisition Sub and Arrow with respect thereto and (c) the decision by the Auditor with respect to any disputes under Section 2.8.3. The Closing Balance Sheet, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of the parties or decision of the Auditor, when final and binding is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_."  

 2.8.5 Adjustments to the Purchase Price. As soon as practicable (but not more than five business days) after the date on which the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall have been determined in accordance with this Section 2.8, (a) Arrow shall pay to Acquisition Sub in immediately available funds the amount, if any, by which the Net Tangible Asset Value on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is less than $50,000,000 (Fifty Million Dollars), or (b) Acquisition Sub shall pay to Arrow in immediately available funds the amount, if any, by which the Net Tangible Asset Value on the Final Closing Balance Sheet is greater than $60,000,000 (Sixty Million Dollars); _provided_ , that no payment made pursuant to this Section 2.8.5 shall exceed the amount of $10,000,000 (Ten Million Dollars). Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.8.5 shall constitute an immediate adjustment of the Purchase Price in such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the existence or possible existence of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, Objection, pendency or resolution of any dispute pursuant to this Section 2.8 or any issue pertaining to the Closing Balance Sheet shall not in any way impact, hinder, prevent or otherwise delay Crossbows obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.   #####

Article 6   

Additional Agreements 

 

 6.1 Non-Solicitation and Superior Proposals  

 6.1.1 Superior Offers. Arrow shall comply with the terms and conditions of Section 6.1 of the Merger Agreement and shall provide Parent copies of any notice sent by Arrow to Crossbow pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Merger Agreement.   

 6.1.2 No Solicitation. Each of Crossbow and Parent agrees that prior to the one-year anniversary of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, advisors, agents, accountants, consultants, employees, investment bankers and legal counsel (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any acquisition proposal to purchase all or substantially all of the Business or the business and operations being acquired by Crossbow and Merger Sub, as the      ##### 

    

case may be; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,

acquisition proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with
respect to any such acquisition proposal, except as to the existence of these
provisions; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any such acquisition proposal;

Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly request that each person which has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with Crossbow or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or
their Representatives with respect to such Persons consideration of
a possible acquisition proposal to promptly return or destroy (which
destruction Crossbow or Parent, as the case may be, shall request be
certified in writing by such person) all confidential information heretofore
furnished by Crossbow or Parent, as the case may be, or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to such person or any
of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives.  

 6.2 Transition of Employees and Consultants. Within five (5) days prior to Closing, Arrow shall provide an updated Employee List, containing the name of each employee of the Business, and each persons level title, role, starting date, annual salary and target bonus, together with a listing of the level of security clearance for such employees. Parent, Federal, Acquisition Sub or one of their Affiliates shall offer to employ or retain as a consultant effective as of 12:00 A.M. on the date immediately following the Closing Date each Dagger Employee and each Dagger Consultant employed by (or providing consulting to) Arrow as of the Closing Date.

In case at any time any further action, including, without limitation, the obtaining of waivers and consents under any agreements, material contracts or leases and the execution and delivery of any licenses or sublicenses for any software, is necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors or representatives of each party to this Agreement are hereby directed and authorized to use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate all required action, except to the extent that greater efforts are required pursuant to Section 6.12.   

 6.6.2 Novation of Contracts; Subcontracting; Maintenance of Corporate Existence of Arrow. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the novation of, or change of name with respect to, each Dagger Government Contract that may     #####

or regulations, and further agrees to provide all documentation necessary to
effect each such novation or change of name, including all instruments,

Government from time to time as may be appropriate and permissible, to
request speedy action on any and all requests for consent to novation or
change of name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Arrow makes no representation
or warranty that any such novation of, or change of name with respect to, any

 8.5 Entire Agreement; Amendment. Unless otherwise herein specifically provided, this Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein (including the Ancillary Agreements) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, exclusive of the Confidentiality Agreements. Each party hereto acknowledges that, in entering this Agreement and completing the transactions contemplated hereby, such party is not relying on any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement not expressly stated in this Agreement or in the agreements among the parties contemplated by or referred to herein (including the Ancillary Agreements). This Agreement, and such other agreements among the parties contemplated by or referred to herein (including the Ancillary Agreements) may not be amended, except in a writing, signed by all parties to this Agreement, whether or not such party to this Agreement is a party to such other agreement. Arrow may not waive any of its rights hereunder without the written consent of Crossbow, which   ##### 

 

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No party hereto shall
amend the Merger Agreement without the consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  

 8.6 Assignability. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of all parties hereto.  

 8.7 Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect.  

 8.8 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages alone may not adequately compensate a party for violation by another party of this Agreement. Accordingly, in addition to all other remedies that may be available hereunder or under applicable law, any party shall have the right to any equitable relief that may be appropriate to remedy a breach or threatened breach by any other party hereunder, including the right to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement by obtaining injunctive relief in respect of any violation or non-performance hereof.  

 8.9 Governing Law This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.  

 8.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Signed counterparts of this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission, and such facsimile or other electronically transmitted counterpart shall constitute an original for all purposes binding against the party who so delivers its counterpart; provided, however, that such party shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that original signed counterparts of this Agreement are delivered to all other parties by overnight courier service within 2 business days of the date of this Agreement.  

 8.11 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations and warranties of Arrow, Parent, Federal and Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement, or any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing, and only those covenants that by their express terms survive the Closing and this Article 8 shall survive Closing.  

 8.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will not confer any rights upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  

 8.13 No Waiver. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing to the contrary; (i) the failure of any party at any time to require performance by the other of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect such partys right thereafter to enforce the same; (ii) no waiver by any party of any default by any other shall be valid unless in writing and acknowledged by an   ##### 

 

authorized representative of the non-defaulting party, and no such waiver
shall be taken or held to be a waiver by such party of any other preceding
or subsequent default; and (iii) no extension of time granted by any party
for the performance of any obligation or act by any other party shall be
deemed to be an extension of time for the performance of any other obligation
or act hereunder.

 _Appendix A_   

 A1 Corporate Status. Arrow is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the requisite corporate power to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Except as set forth on _Schedule A1_ , Arrow is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes qualification necessary, except where failure to be so qualified would be immaterial. _Schedule A1_ provides a list of the states and other jurisdictions in which (i) any Dagger Subsidiary is qualified to conduct business, (ii) any Dagger Facility is located or (iii) any Dagger Employee conducts business on behalf of the Business (excluding any conduct of business or performance of services at client locations).  

 A2 Subsidiaries. R.M. Vredenburg and Co. and Karcher Group, Inc. constitute all of Arrows Subsidiaries involved with the Business (each a " _Dagger Subsidiary_ ," and, collectively, the " _Dagger Subsidiaries_ "). Arrow owns all of the capital stock and other equity interests of the Dagger Subsidiaries, and the date on which Arrow acquired or organized each such entity is listed opposite the name of such entity on such schedule. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, conversion rights or other rights, securities, agreements or commitments obligating any Dagger Subsidiary to issue, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of its capital stock or other equity interests, or any securities or obligations convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any shares of its capital stock or other equity interests. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which any of Arrow or any Dagger Subsidiary (Arrow and each Dagger Subsidiary each individually a " _Dagger Company_ ," and, collectively, the " _Dagger Companies_ ") is a party with respect to the voting of the shares of the capital stock or other equity interests of any Dagger Subsidiary and no Dagger Subsidiary is a party to, or bound by, any outstanding restrictions, options or other obligations, agreements or commitments to sell, repurchase, redeem or acquire any of its securities. Except as set forth on _Schedule A2_, each Dagger Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes qualification necessary, except where failure to be so qualified would be immaterial.  

 A3 Authority for Agreement; Noncontravention  

 A3.1 Authority. Arrow has the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent of its obligations hereunder. Arrows execution and delivery of this Agreement and its consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by its board of directors and no other corporate proceedings on its part are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby have been duly executed and delivered by Arrow and constitute valid and binding obligations of Arrow, enforceable against Arrow in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the qualifications that enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby and thereby is subject to (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws of general application     ##### 

    

affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, (b) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) and (c) the availability of specific performance or other
equitable or legal remedies specified herein.  

 A3.2 No Conflict. Except as set forth on _Schedule A3.2_, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and Ancillary Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the charter documents or by-laws of any Dagger Company or (b) with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in any right to accelerate or result in the creation of any Security Interest pursuant to, or right of termination under, any provision of any Dagger Material Contract or any contract listed on _Schedule A16.1_ (or to the Knowledge of Arrow, any other contract, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, instrument or other agreement), Permit, concession, grant, judgment, order, decree, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation to which any Dagger Company is a party (and in each case which creates or gives rise to a Dagger Obligation) or by which any  of the Dagger Assets or the assets or properties of any Dagger Subsidiary are bound, or which is applicable to any Dagger Company, any Dagger Assets or any of the assets or properties of any Dagger Subsidiary. Except to the extent that novation is required as further described in Section 6.6.2 above, except for filings that may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), the Exon-Florio Amendment to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 or the competition laws of Germany, except as set forth on _Schedule A3.2_ and except for such consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which if not obtained or made would be immaterial, no authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with or notice to, any United States or foreign governmental or public body or authority (each a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 A4 Financial Statements. Attached as _Schedule A4_ are a consolidated balance sheet for the Reported Business as of December 31, 2003 and statement of operations for the year then ended. Collectively, the financial statements referred to in the immediately preceding sentence are sometimes referred to herein as the " _Dagger Financial Statements_ " and the Reported Businesss balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 is referred to herein as the " _Dagger Balance Sheet_." The Dagger Balance Sheet (including any related notes) fairly presents in all material respects the Reported Businesss financial position as of its date, and the statement of operations included in the Dagger Financial Statements (including any related notes) fairly presents in all material respects the Reported Businesss results of operations for the period therein set forth, each having been prepared and compiled in accordance with GAAP, it being understood that the Dagger Financial Statements have been prepared on a pro forma basis, reflecting the separation of the Reported Business from Arrow. _"Reported Business_ " means the "Defense and Intelligence Group" of Arrow (excluding any business performed in Canada by a Dagger Company) together with the business of the Dagger Subsidiaries (including any federal civilian, state and local engagements of such Dagger Subsidiaries) on a consolidated basis. To the Knowledge of Arrow, there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of Arrows internal controls which could adversely affect Arrows ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data relating to the Business. To the Knowledge of Arrow, there is no fraud relating to the Business, whether material or not, that involves   ##### 

 

management or other employees who have a significant role in Arrows internal
controls.  

 A5 Absence of Material Adverse Changes. Except as set forth on _Schedule A5_ , since December 31, 2003 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ "), Arrow has not suffered a Dagger Material Adverse Effect, and, to the Knowledge of Arrow, there has not occurred or arisen any event, condition or state of facts of any character that would reasonably be expected to result in a Dagger Material Adverse Effect.  

 A6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on _Schedule A6_ , the Reported Business has no Liabilities that are not fully reflected or provided for on, or disclosed in the notes to, the balance sheets included in the Dagger Financial Statements, except (a) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Balance Sheet Date, none of which individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to be material, (b) Liabilities permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, (c) Liabilities not within the Knowledge of Arrow that are not required to be disclosed by Arrow under GAAP, (d) Liabilities for future performance under contracts, and (e) Liabilities expressly disclosed on the Schedules delivered hereunder.  

 A7 Compliance with Applicable Law, Charter and By-Laws. Each Dagger Company has all requisite licenses, permits and certificates from all Governmental Entities necessary to conduct the Business as currently conducted, and to own, lease and operate their respective properties used in the Business in the manner currently held and operated (collectively, " _Permits_ "), except as set forth on _Schedule A7_ and except for any Permits the absence of which, either singly or in the aggregate, is immaterial and would not reasonably be expected to have a material effect or prevent or materially delay the Closing. All of such Permits are in full force and effect. Each Dagger Company is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions related to such Permits. There are no proceedings in progress, pending or, to the Knowledge of Arrow, threatened, which may result in revocation, cancellation, suspension, or any materially adverse modification of any of such Permits. The Business is not being, and has not been, conducted in violation of any applicable law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, judgment, decree, order, Permit, concession, grant or other authorization of any Governmental Entity. No Dagger Company is in default or violation of any provision of its charter documents or its by-laws where such default or violation is material.  

 A8 Litigation and Proceedings. Except for any claim, action, suit or proceeding set forth on _Schedule A8_, (a) there is no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Business pending or, to the Knowledge of Arrow, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity notified any Dagger Company an intention to conduct the same; (b) there is no claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Arrow, threatened against or involving any Dagger Company and involving the Business, any of the Dagger Assets or any of the assets or properties of any Dagger Subsidiary, at law or in equity, or before any arbitrator or Governmental Entity; and (c) there are no judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against any Dagger Company (i) affecting the Business, the Dagger Assets or the assets or properties of any Dagger Subsidiary or (ii) which create a Dagger Obligation in each case to the extent that the resolution of such dispute or claim will be binding on Acquisition Sub or a Dagger Subsidiary or give rise to a Dagger Obligation.   ##### 

 

 A9 Tax Matters  

 A9.1 Filing of Returns. Each Dagger Subsidiary has timely filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file, and Arrow has timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Business that it was required to file in each case taking into account all validly obtained extensions. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) by any Dagger Subsidiary, or by Arrow with respect to the Business, have been paid. To the extent that any Dagger Subsidiary has any Liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) for Taxes due and payable by Arrow or any member of Arrows consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group, such Taxes have been paid. No Dagger Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim relating to the Business has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where any Dagger Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, which claims have not been resolved. There are no Security Interests on any of the Dagger Assets or on any assets of any Dagger Subsidiary that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax, other than Permitted Encumbrances.   

 A9.2 Payment of Taxes. Each Dagger Subsidiary, and with respect to the Business, Arrow, has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party with respect to the Business.   

 A9.3 Assessments or Disputes. To the Knowledge of Arrow, no Tax authority proposes to assess any additional Taxes upon any Dagger Subsidiary or upon Arrow with respect to the Business, in each case for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. Except as described in written materials delivered to Acquisition Sub, there is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax Liability of any Dagger Subsidiary, or of Arrow with respect to the Business, either (a) claimed or raised in writing by any Tax authority or (b) to the Knowledge of Arrow, otherwise claimed or raised by any Tax authority, in each case to the extent that resolution of such dispute or claim will be binding upon Acquisition Sub or a Dagger Subsidiary after the Closing. Except to the extent otherwise described in written materials delivered to Acquisition Sub, Arrow has delivered to Acquisition Sub, or made available for review by Acquisition Sub, correct and complete copies of all income Tax Returns, examination reports and statements of deficiencies that were (i) filed by, assessed against or agreed to by or with respect to any Dagger Subsidiary and (ii) expressly included within a written due diligence request made by Acquisition Sub prior to the date hereof.   

 A9.4 Waiver of Statute of Limitations. No Dagger Company has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes that relate to the Business or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency that relates to the Business, in each case to the extent that resolution of such assessment or deficiency will be binding upon Acquisition Sub or a Dagger Subsidiary after the Closing.   

 A9.5 Collapsible Corporations, Golden Parachutes, Real Property Holding Corporations. No Dagger Subsidiary has filed a consent under Code section 341(f) concerning collapsible corporations. Except as set forth on _Schedule A9.5_ , no Dagger     ##### 

    

Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that
has resulted or would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment
of (a) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law)
and (b) any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Section
162(m) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax law). No Dagger Subsidiary has been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Code section 897(c)(2) during the
applicable period specified in Code section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). No Dagger
Subsidiary is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement under which
such Dagger Subsidiary will have any liability after the Closing. No Dagger
Subsidiary (A) has been a member of an Affiliated Group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was
Arrow) or (B) has any Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than a
member of an Affiliated Group the common parent of which was Arrow) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law). Prior to the applicable due date
(including extensions), Arrow shall file a consolidated federal income tax
return with the Dagger Subsidiaries, among other Persons, for the taxable
year immediately preceding the current taxable year.  

 A9.6 Unpaid Taxes. The unpaid Taxes of the Dagger Companies for which Acquisition Sub and/or the Dagger Subsidiaries shall be liable (a) did not, as of the date of the Dagger Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) reflected in the Dagger Balance Sheet and (b) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Dagger Companies in filing their Tax Returns.   

 A9.7 Unclaimed Property. No Dagger Company has any assets that may constitute unclaimed property under applicable law. The Dagger Companies have complied in all material respects with all applicable unclaimed property laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Dagger Companies have established and followed procedures to identify any unclaimed property and, to the extent required by applicable law, remit such unclaimed property to the applicable governmental authority. The records of the Dagger Companies are adequate to permit a governmental agency or authority or other outside auditor to confirm the foregoing representations.   

 A9.8 No Changes in Accounting, Closing Agreement, Installment Sale. No Dagger Subsidiary will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a result of any (a) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Code section 481(c) (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law), other than any such change required as a result of the transactions occurring at Closing pursuant to this Agreement; (b) "closing agreement" as described in Code section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (c) deferred intercompany gain or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Code section 1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law); (d) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; or (e) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.     ##### 

    

 A9.9 Acquisitions. No Dagger Subsidiary has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code section 355 or Code section 361.   

 A10 Employee Benefit Plans  

 A10.1 List of Plans/Plan Determinations. _Schedule A10.1_ contains a complete list of all of the Dagger Companies employee pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) which are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and that cover Dagger Employees or Dagger Consultants (the " _Pension Plans_ ").
