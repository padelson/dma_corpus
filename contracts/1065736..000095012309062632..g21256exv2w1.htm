minimum damages that the Party entitled to such damages will suffer or incur as a result of the
event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a
penalty. Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Each of the Parties further acknowledges the
difficulty in estimating such damages, which are based in part on the loss of opportunities which
will arise as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant failure of the
Closing to occur on the termination of this Agreement. Because of this difficulty, the Parties have
made a genuine pre-estimate of the minimum amount of damages which will be suffered and have
reserved the right to make claims for additional damages if actual damages exceed the estimated
amounts.

other Party and its Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Each Party shall
provide any other Party with any information for inclusion in the Registration Statement which may
