2\. _Assignment and Assumption of Rights and Obligations_. Johnson Polymer
hereby assigns and transfers to JDI, and JDI hereby assumes from Johnson
Polymer, all rights, obligations and liabilities of Johnson Polymer set forth

rights, obligations and liabilities set forth in or arising pursuant to
Section 7 thereof (Rentals), Section 16 thereof (Environmental Matters), Section 17

modified by this Agreement, are hereby approved and ratified by the parties.
The Lease Agreement, as modified by this Agreement, shall remain in full force
and effect. The parties acknowledge that by notice of termination given by SCJ
on December 22, 2005, the Lease Agreement will expire on July 2, 2006.

4\. _Repair and Maintenance Payment_. JDI and Johnson Polymer acknowledge and
agree that, as of the date hereof, $2,200,000 (the " _Repair and Maintenance
Amount_ ") is due and owing to SCJ for currently identified repairs and
maintenance of the Premises pursuant to Section 9 of the Lease Agreement
and that JDI and Johnson Polymer shall pay SCJ the Repair and Maintenance
Amount within three business days after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement or, if earlier, on June 30, 2006. The
Repair and Maintenance Amount shall be paid by JDI and Johnson Polymer to SCJ
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
SCJ. That portion of the Repair and Maintenance Amount relating to the Johnson
Polymer sewer overhaul project (at an estimated budgeted cost of $500,000 for
the current scope of that project) shall be subject to a future true-up by SCJ
to take into account the actual versus budgeted expenditures for that portion
of the Repair and Maintenance Amount. As to such true-up, SCJ shall pay to
JDI any excess of the budget ($500,000) over the actual cost of such Johnson
Polymer sewer overhaul project and JDI shall pay to SCJ any excess of the
actual cost of such project over such budgeted amount. Such
payment obligation and true-up obligation shall survive the expiration of the
Lease. JDI and Johnson Polymer are jointly and severally responsible for
payment of the Repair and Maintenance Amount. The parties acknowledge that the
costs of any additional repair, maintenance and replacement projects shall be
payable in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

5\. _Toll Manufacturing Payment_. Subject to agreement between the parties as
to the terms of a definitive toll manufacturing agreement in relation to
certain manufacturing to occur on the Premises, (a) $3,500,000 (the " _Toll
Manufacturing Amount_ ") is due and owing to SCJ as consideration for SCJ
entering into any such toll manufacturing agreement and (b) JDI shall pay SCJ
the Toll Manufacturing Amount within three business days after the later of
(i) July 2, 2006, or (ii) the execution of the definitive toll manufacturing
agreement; provided, however, that if the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") has not occurred by
July 2, 2006, then, subject to the parties agreement as to the terms of a
definitive toll manufacturing agreement, in lieu of an up-front payment of the
entire Toll Manufacturing Amount, JDI and SCJ will in good faith agree upon
increased tolling charges based on SCJs actual budget (which would
effectively include the Toll Manufacturing Amount), provided further that if
the Closing occurs at any time during the toll manufacturing agreement, then
within three business days after the Closing JDI shall pay to SCJ an agreed
revised Toll Manufacturing Amount and thereafter the tolling charges would be
appropriately reduced to reflect that up-front payment..



 

2 6\. _Integration_. This Agreement and the Lease Agreement and the schedules
thereto contain the entire agreement among the parties. In the event a
provision of this Agreement and the Lease Agreement are in conflict, the
provisions of this Agreement and then the Lease Agreement shall control, in
that order.

7\. _Effective Date._ Except for Section 4 (which shall be effective
immediately) and Section 5 (which shall be effective on the execution of the
toll manufacturing agreement referenced in such Section), this Agreement
(including the assignment and assumption of the Lease Agreement) shall be
effective upon the Closing. In the event the Closing does not occur on or
