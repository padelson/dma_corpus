Section 2.5 _Consolidated Working Capital Payment Adjustment_.

principles and sample calculation set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ (which balance
sheet shall include the working capital broken down on an entity-by-entity

balance sheet and a schedule showing the calculation of the Consolidated
Working Capital on an entity-by-entity basis as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital_ ") to the Representative within 45
days of the Closing Date. The Representative will have 30 days following
delivery of the balance sheet to review the consolidated balance sheet,
and the expense of conducting such review will be borne exclusively by the
Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating the
Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital, Taxes shall not be taken into
account in accordance with GAAP, but shall instead be taken into account in
accordance with the principles used in calculating Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods as determined under _Section 8.2(c)_, _Section 8.3_, and  _Section
8.8_.

(b) Purchaser will provide the Representative with access to (i) work papers

Purchaser, the Acquired Entities, or the Subsidiaries (including their
respective accountants work papers) reasonably requested by the
Representative to assist the Representative in his or her review of the
Closing Date Consolidated

 



15  Working Capital. Unless the Representative delivers a dispute notice within
30 days after receipt of the calculation of the proposed Closing Date
Consolidated Working Capital, the proposed Closing Date Consolidated Working
Capital shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not
be subject to dispute or review. If the Representative disagrees with the
Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital, the Representative will notify
Purchaser of such disagreement, setting forth in detail the particulars of
such disagreement within 30 days after the Representatives receipt of Closing
Date Consolidated Working Capital. In the event of any such notice
of disagreement, Purchaser and the Representative will use their reasonable
efforts for a period of 20 days to resolve any disagreements with respect to
the calculation of any portion of the Closing Date Consolidated Working
Capital, and if the parties are able to resolve such dispute, the proposed
Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, and shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If at
the end of such period, they are unable to resolve any disagreements,
Purchaser and the Representative will engage Ernst and Young LLP or, if such
firm is not independent of Parent, Purchaser or the Acquired Entities, or is
unwilling or unable to serve, a mutually agreeable independent accounting firm

Purchaser will each inform the Accountants in writing of their respective
determinations of the Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital and will
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Accountants in its determinations of
all disputed items. The Accountants, acting as experts and not as arbitrators,
will resolve as promptly as practicable any such disagreements. The
determination of the Accountants will be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties and such resolution will be based on the provisions of this Agreement
relating to the calculation of the Closing Date Consolidated Working Capital.
The Representative and Purchaser will share equally the fees and expenses
incurred by the Accountants in resolving such disagreements. The date of the
final resolution of the Consolidated Working Capital as of the Closing Date
will be referred to as the " _Determination Date_." The amount of the
Consolidated Working Capital as of the Closing Date as finally determined on
an entity-by-entity basis pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the "
_Final Consolidated Working Capital Amount_."

Consolidated Working Capital, then within 10 Business Days following the
Determination Date, Parent will pay the Representative the total amount by
which the Final Consolidated Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target
Consolidated Working Capital. Such amount will be paid in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Representative. If the Final
Consolidated Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Consolidated
Working Capital, then within 10 Business Days following the Determination
Date, the Representative will pay Purchaser the total amount by which the
Final Consolidated Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Consolidated
Working Capital. To the extent the Final Consolidated Working Capital Amount
with respect to an Acquired Entity exceeds the Target Consolidated Working
Capital Amount with respect to such Acquired Entity, as set forth in _Schedule
2.5_, the Representative shall pay to the Equityholders of such Acquired
Entity, in accordance with their applicable percentage interests in such
Acquired Entity, the amount of by which the Final Consolidated Working Capital
Amount with respect to an Acquired Entity exceeds the Target Consolidated
Working Capital Amount with respect to such Acquired Entity, as set forth in
_Schedule 2.5_. To the extent the Final Consolidated Working Capital Amount
with respect to an Acquired Entity is less than the Target Consolidated
Working Capital Amount with respect to

 



16  such Acquired Entity, as set forth in _Schedule 2.5_ , the Equityholders of
such Acquired Entity shall pay, in accordance with their applicable percentage
interests in such Acquired Entity, the amount of by which the Final
Consolidated Working Capital Amount with respect to an Acquired Entity is less
than the Target Consolidated Working Capital Amount with respect to such
Acquired Entity, as set forth in _Schedule 2.5_ , to the Representative.

this Agreement, Parent, after consultation with Representative, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise deliverable
under this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent or its Affiliates may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under

whom such deduction and withholding was made.

available to Purchaser true and complete copies of all leases for the Leased
Real Property together with all amendments, modifications or supplements, if

proceedings, and no written notices of violation pending or, to the Knowledge

exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default thereunder and (b) no such Permit will be subject to suspension,

contemplated hereby. 

Section 4.23 _Sufficiency of Assets_. The property and assets owned or leased
by the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries constitute all of the property and
assets used or held for use in connection with the Business of the Acquired
Entities and Subsidiaries as currently conducted on the date of this

contemplated hereby.

adulteration and misbranding are substantially the same as those contained in
the FDCA at the time of such shipment or delivery; and (c) not articles which
could not, under the provisions of Section 404 or 505 of the FDCA, be
introduced into interstate commerce. Since January 1, 2009, no product

condition. Should any fact or condition require any change to the

by the Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries or on their behalf during such

confidentiality agreement or (iv) use of such information is necessary
or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, each of
the Acquired Entities, Parent and Purchaser will hold, and will cause its
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information
received from the other party in confidence until such time as such
information becomes publicly available (otherwise than through the wrongful
act of any such Person) and will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that such Persons do not disclose such information to others without the prior
written consent of the Acquired Entities or Purchaser, as the case may be.

Section 7.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the other Ancillary
Agreements, each of the parties will use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to

manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including (a) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, authorizations and approvals, (i) from Governmental
Authorities

 



42  and (ii) as required by any Contract, Order or license to which any Acquired
Entity or Subsidiary is a party or subject to on the Closing Date and the
making of all necessary filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary (A) to obtain any Permit, consent, approval, waiver from or
exemption, (B) to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental
Authority, or (C) to avoid an occurrence of default under the provisions
thereof, result in the acceleration of any obligation thereunder or give rise
to a right of any party thereto to terminate its obligations thereunder, (b)
obtaining all necessary Permits, (c) defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, at law or in equity,
challenging this Agreement or other Ancillary Agreements or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated, stayed or reversed and (d) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purpose of, this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that other than as provided in _Section
7.3_ hereof, a party will not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the
foregoing if the taking of such action or the obtaining of any Permit,
approval, waiver from, or exemption is reasonably likely to be materially
burdensome to such party or to impact in a materially adverse manner the
economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby so as to
render inadvisable the consummation of such transactions; _provided, further,_
that the Equityholders, Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries will not be
required to make payments in order to obtain such actions, nonactions,
waivers, consents, authorizations or approvals. All waivers, consents and
approvals obtained pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ will be produced at Closing
in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

Section 7.3 _Antitrust Notification and Other Regulatory Filings_. As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of the Acquired
Entities, Parent and Purchaser will make all required filings with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department
of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the Acquired Entities, Parent and Purchaser
will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of such
filing and any supplemental filing or submission which is necessary under the
HSR Act. The Acquired Entities, Parent and Purchaser will keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and will comply
with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable. Each of the
Acquired Entities, Parent and Purchaser will take any action required to be
taken by such party, and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act or to resolve any objections to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Ancillary Agreements that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority,
including to cause to be lifted any restraint, injunction or other legal
impediment until such time as such restraint, injunction or other legal
impediment has become final and nonappealable, in each case as promptly as
practicable, _provided_ that neither Parent nor Purchaser will be required to
agree, and the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries will not agree
without Purchasers consent, to waive any rights to or accept any limitation
on its operations that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on the Business or the business, assets, results of operations or financial
condition of Parent or to dispose of any assets in connection with obtaining
any such consent or authorization.

 



43 Section 7.4 _Compliance with Securities Laws_. In connection with the

controlled by any of them will be repaid along with all accrued interest and
as of the Closing, no outstanding amounts will be due to any Acquired Entity
or Subsidiary from any such equityholder or employee or any such controlled
entity. No Acquired Entity or Subsidiary will forgive any such Indebtedness
nor will it disperse funds by way of bonus or otherwise to any such
equityholder or employee or any such controlled entity for the direct or
indirect purpose of providing funds to repay such loans or advances. Each
Acquired Entity or Subsidiary will repay any check payable or debt-like
instruments payable to any Equityholder by such Acquired Entity or Subsidiary,
except to the extent such check payable or debt-like instrument is included as
a current liability in the calculation of Consolidated Working Capital as of
the Closing Date.

Section 7.7 _Supplying of Financial Statements_. Each Acquired Entity and
each of the Equityholders covenant to deliver to Purchaser no later than June

instruments and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the other
parties to confirm or perfect or otherwise to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement.

Section 7.9 _Public Announcements_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the

other before issuing, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on, any press release or other public statements relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will not

consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement of Parent with any securities
exchange.

Section 7.10 _Escrow Agreement_. At the Closing, Purchaser, the Equityholders
and an escrow agent (as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Equityholders) will enter into an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form
of _Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

Section 7.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date

Continuing Company Employees with employee benefits under Company Employee
Plans (excluding any Pension Plan, other than employee contributions to a
401(k) plan but not including any discretionary or matching contribution
thereon) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee
benefits provided by the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries (excluding
any Pension Plan, other than employee contributions to a 401(k) plan but not
including any discretionary or matching contribution thereon) on the date of
this Agreement.

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, excluding both any
retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Company
Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate effective as of the Closing
Date, Parent and Purchaser will recognize all service of the Company
Continuing Employees with the Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent or Purchaser, for vesting and eligibility purposes
(but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies under any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan, (ii) benefit accrual
purposes (except for vacation, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing Date, or (iii) any frozen Parent Benefit Plan); _provided_
, that such service will not be recognized to the extent that (A) such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (B) such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement will create any right or obligation which is
enforceable by any Company Employee, former Company Employee, Company
Continuing Employee or any Person with respect to any terms or conditions of
employment, including, but not limited to, the benefits and compensation
described in this  _Section 7.11_. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amendments to the Acquired Entities, Subsidiaries, Parents and Purchasers
benefit and compensation plans, programs or arrangements will occur only in
accordance with their respective terms and will be pursuant to action taken
by the Acquired Entities, Subsidiaries, Parent and Purchaser which are
independent of the consummation of this Agreement or any continuing
obligations hereunder.

the Closing, Parent shall arrange for the replacement of any letters of
credit issued under such line of credit.

Section 7.15 _Intercompany Indebtedness_. Prior to Closing, each Acquired
Entity shall take all actions necessary to cause all existing intercompany
Indebtedness to be repaid or cancelled.

Section 7.16 _Acquired Equity Transfer Restrictions_. RAL and the
Equityholders shall cause the Bylaws of RAL, dated October 11, 1984 to be
amended prior to Closing to remove all restrictions on the transfer of the
Acquired Equity of RAL. LBI and the Equityholders shall waive all restrictions
on the transfer of the Acquired Equity of LBI pursuant to this Agreement.
Additionally, each Acquired Entity shall terminate or cause to be terminated
prior to Closing all agreements (other than restrictions in the charter of
such Acquired Entity) that contain any restrictions on the transfer of the
Acquired Equity of such Acquired Entity.

 

ARTICLE VIII

_TAX MATTERS_

Section 8.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) The Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, in a manner consistent with the Acquired Entities and
Subsidiaries past practice, except to the extent otherwise required by the
applicable Tax Law, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries
which are due on or prior to the Closing Date and shall timely file such Tax
Returns and timely pay all Taxes shown as due thereon. All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Tax Law in all material
respects. The Representative shall promptly provide, or cause to be promptly
provided, to Purchaser copies of such Tax Returns and evidence that all Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns have been timely paid.

 

(b) The Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries past practice,
except to the extent otherwise required by the applicable Tax Law or _Section
8.6_ and _Section 8.7_ of this Agreement, all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Entities and Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. In preparing such Tax Returns, the Representative shall have the
sole authority to determine whether the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries
shall report any gain from the transaction described herein on the
installment method. The Representative shall have the

 



46  sole right to determine which of the transaction expenses will be taken as a
deduction on such Tax Return. The Representative shall deliver to Parent or
Purchaser draft copies of each such income Tax Return at least 60 days prior
to the date for filing such Tax Return. At least 30 days prior to the due date
of each such Tax Return prepared in accordance with this _Section 8.1(b)_,
Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Representative its comments, if any,
in writing relating to such Tax Return. The Representative shall make all
changes to each such Tax Return reasonably requested in writing by Parent or
Purchaser to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Tax Law or _Section
8.6_ and _Section 8.7_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
changes do not materially increase the indemnification obligations of the
Equityholders under  _Section 8.2_, decrease a Tax refund or credit for
overpayment under _Section 8.8_, or increase any Tax liability of an
Equityholder. Parent will either pay directly (if permitted), or will advance
to the Acquired Corporations if not permitted to be paid directly an amount
equal to the Corporate Level Taxes resulting from an Election no later than
five days prior to the time such Corporate Level Taxes are due and payable
with each such Tax Return and the Acquired Corporations shall promptly pay
the amount of such Corporate Level Taxes to the applicable taxing authority.
If the Equityholders are required to personally pay any Corporate Level Taxes,
Parent shall advance to the Representative such amount of Corporate Level
Taxes no later than five days prior to the time such Corporate Level Taxes are
due. If the time for filing Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date is timely extended, Parent shall either pay directly (if
permitted), or shall advance to the Representative if not permitted to be paid
directly an amount equal to the Corporate Level Taxes resulting from an
Election no later than five days prior to the time such Corporate Level Taxes
are due and payable with each such extension or otherwise due. The
Representative shall promptly provide, or cause to be promptly provided, to
Purchaser copies of such timely filed Tax Returns and evidence that all Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns have been timely paid.

(c) Parent or Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries
for Straddle Periods that are due after the Closing Date in a manner
consistent with the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries past practice, except
to the extent otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. Parent or Purchaser
shall deliver to the Representative draft copies of each such Tax Return
related to the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries at least 60 days prior to
the date for filing such Tax Return. At least 30 days prior to the due date
of each such Tax Return prepared in accordance with this _Section 8.1(c)_,
the Representative shall deliver to Parent or Purchaser his or her comments,
if any, in writing relating to such Tax Return. Parent or Purchaser shall
make all changes to each such Tax Return reasonably requested in writing by
the Representative to the extent such changes would minimize the
indemnification obligations of the Equityholders pursuant to _Section
8.2_, maximize the refund rights of the Equityholders pursuant to _Section
8.8_, or otherwise decrease the Tax liability of an Equityholder provided that
such changes do not have a material adverse effect on Parent or Purchaser and
are not inconsistent with applicable Tax Law. The Representative shall
promptly pay, or cause to be promptly paid, to Parent or Purchaser the amount
of such Tax for which the Equityholders are responsible pursuant to this
Agreement for any such Tax Return prepared in accordance with this _Section
8.1(c)_, to the extent not paid at or before Closing. To the extent the
Equityholders, Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries have paid an amount
with respect to a Tax Return described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ that is in
excess of the Taxes allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, as determined in
accordance with _Section 8.3_ and that was not taken into account in the
Final Consolidated Working Capital

 



47  Amount, Parent shall promptly pay over such excess amount to the
Representative for the benefit of the Equityholders of the Acquired Entity
that paid such excess amount in proportion to their former ownership of such
Acquired Entity.

Section 8.2 _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent treated as
a liability in the calculation of the Final Consolidated Working Capital
Amount or such Tax constitutes a Corporate Level Tax, subject to the
applicable limitations set forth in _Section 10.4_, the Equityholders will
indemnify Parent and Purchaser for (a) any Loss attributable to any breach of
or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in _Section 4.8_;
(b) any Loss attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to fully
perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in this _Article
VIII_ ; (c) all Taxes of the Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries or relating to
the Business for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (d) all Taxes of any member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the
Acquired Entities and Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the Acquired
Entities and Subsidiaries) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date
by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
comparable or similar provision of state, local or foreign Law; (e) any and
all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries
arising under the principles of transferee or successor liability or by
contract, relating to any event or transaction occurring before the Closing
Date; and (f) any amount due and owing from the Equityholders to Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.6(e)_ or  _Section 8.6(f)_, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Loss in respect of Taxes
shall be limited to Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to
the extent of any breach of or any inaccuracy in _Section 4.8(e)_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Equityholders shall not
be liable for any diminution in Tax benefits suffered by the Purchaser or
Parent in the event an Election is determined to be invalid, including,
without limitation, a challenge as a result of a breach of the representation
set forth in the first sentence of _Section 4.8(a)_. To the extent any
Equityholder pays more than such Equityholders Pro Rata Portion of any
Losses, such Equityholder shall have the right to seek contribution from the
Equityholders that paid less than their Pro Rata Portion of such Losses.

Section 8.3 _Straddle Period_. In the case of the Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
(each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes
that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement will be:
(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income, receipts, sales or
payroll deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year
ended with the Closing Date; and (b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

Section 8.4 _Tax Contests_. Purchaser agrees to give written notice to the
Representative upon its receipt (or the receipt by any of its Affiliates) of
any written notice from a Governmental Authority which involves the assertion
of any claim, or the commencement of any action, in respect of which an
indemnity may be sought by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to _Article 8.2_ , a
Tax may be sought from an Equityholder or a Tax refund or credit described in
_Article 8.8_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ that failure to comply with this
provision will not affect Parents or Purchasers right to indemnification
hereunder, unless and only to the extent that

 



48  such failure results in a material prejudice to the Equityholders. The
Representative will control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative will obtain the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of a Tax Claim or
ceasing to defend such Tax Claim if such action would adversely impact Parent
or Purchaser; _provided further_ , that Purchaser or Parent will have the
right to participate in the defense of such Tax Claim, and to employ counsel
of its choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate
counsel will be borne by Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be. The
Representative shall promptly notify Purchaser if the Representative decides
not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim which it is entitled
to control pursuant to this _Section 8.4_, and Purchaser or Parent shall
thereupon be permitted to have the exclusive right to control, defend and
settle such Tax Claim, and any costs and expenses of defense and
investigation, including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees, incurred
or suffered by Parent or Purchaser in connection with such defense shall
constitute Losses subject to indemnification under this Agreement, regardless
of the outcome of the Tax Claim and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.2_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of a Tax Claim or ceasing
to defend such Tax Claim if such action would adversely impact the
Equityholders.

 

Section 8.5 _Cooperation_. The Equityholders and Purchaser will provide each
other with such cooperation and information as either may reasonably request
of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Article VIII_ or in
connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of any of
the Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries. Each of the Equityholders and
Purchaser will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and material records and
other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of any of the
Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without
regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in
writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods. The Equityholders
agree, upon request by Purchaser, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed on or become a liability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

 

Section 8.6 _Election_.

(a) With respect to the sale and purchase of each of the Acquired
Corporations, at Purchasers option, the Equityholders and Parent will, where
permissible, jointly make a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code, and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state or
local income tax Laws (collectively, the " _Elections_ "), and file the
Elections in accordance with applicable Law. Parent, Purchaser, the
Equityholders, and the Acquired Corporations, to the maximum extent
permissible under GAAP or applicable Tax Law, will (i) report the transaction
consistent with such Elections, (ii) agree not to take any action that could
cause such Elections to be invalid, and (iii) will take no position contrary
thereto. Pursuant to this _Section 8.6_, Purchaser will bear the
responsibility for payment of any Corporate Level Taxes, as set forth in 
_Section 8.1(b)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

 



49  contrary, neither Purchaser or Parent shall file an Election with respect to
an Acquired Corporation if the Preliminary Tax Adjustment with respect to such
Acquired Corporation has not yet been paid.

(b) To the extent possible, Parent, the Equityholders and the Acquired
Corporations will execute at the Closing any and all forms necessary to
effectuate the Elections (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 and any
similar forms under applicable state and local income tax laws (the " _Section
338 Forms_ ") provided that the respective Preliminary Tax Adjustment (as
defined in _Section 8.6(c)_) has been agreed to. In the event, however, any
Section 338 Forms are not executed at the Closing, Parent, the Equityholders
and the Acquired Corporations will prepare and complete each such Section 338
Form no later than 45 days prior to the date such Section 338 Form is required
to be filed, provided that the respective Preliminary Tax Adjustment has been
agreed to. Parent, Purchaser, the Equityholders and the Acquired Corporations
will each cause the Section 338 Forms to be duly executed by an authorized
person of Parent, Purchaser, the Equityholders and the Acquired Corporations
in each case, and will duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms in
accordance with applicable Tax Law and the terms of this Agreement.

(c) The calculation of the Preliminary Tax Adjustment with respect to each of
the Acquired Corporations in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.6(d)_ is
set forth in _Schedule 8.6(c)_ (each such calculation with respect to an
Acquired Corporation, a " _Preliminary Tax Adjustment_ "). During the 90 day
period beginning on the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare for the
Representatives review and comment an allocation of the purchase price set
forth in  _Section 2.2(a)_ attributable to the each of the Acquired
Corporations and other relevant items among the assets of the Acquired
Corporations, including their ownership of the Subsidiaries (each such
allocation, an " _Interim Allocation_ ") in accordance with Section 1060 and
Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. A tax
adjustment shall be calculated based on the Interim Allocation in accordance
with the terms of _Section 8.6(d)_ (each such calculation, an " _Interim Tax
Adjustment_ "). No more than 10 days after the Representatives receipt of
such Interim Allocation, the Representative shall deliver to Parent his or
her comments, if any, in writing relating to such Interim Allocation. Parent
shall consider any reasonable written comments of the Representative to the
Interim Allocation in good faith. If the parties are unable to agree with
respect to any such Interim Allocation, Parents position with respect to
such disagreement shall be used in such Interim Allocation unless inconsistent
with applicable Law (the " _Final Allocation_ "). Parent and the
Equityholders shall prepare IRS Form 8883 consistently with the Final
Allocation and shall report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and
for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation.

 

(d) Each Preliminary Tax Adjustment and Interim Tax Adjustment shall be an
amount, taking into account the amount and character of the income subject to
Tax, equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the Taxes payable by the
Equityholders resulting solely from (X) the deemed sale of the assets of each
of the Acquired Corporations, assuming an Election is made with respect to
the particular Acquired Corporation, and (Y) the deemed liquidation of each of
the Acquired Corporations, assuming an Election is made with respect to the
particular Acquired Corporation, taking into account all payments made
under this Agreement with respect to such Acquired Corporation, including
payments made pursuant to this _Section 8.6_, and (ii) the amount of Taxes
which would have been imposed on the Equityholders with respect to the sale 

 



50  of the Acquired Equity of each such Acquired Corporation, as contemplated
herein, had an Election not been made with respect to each such Acquired
Corporation (for the avoidance of doubt, such difference shall be the result
obtained by subtracting the amount described in _clause (ii)_ of this
sentence from the amount described in _clause (i)_ of this sentence),
provided that for purposes of calculating the amount of each Preliminary Tax
Adjustment and Interim Tax Adjustment the following rules shall be applied:
(A) the federal and state income Tax rates used in calculating the amount of
any income Taxes that would have been or will be imposed on the Equityholders
shall be the highest marginal federal and state rates applicable to the type
of income recognized (i.e., ordinary income, short-term capital gain or long-
term capital gain, as applicable) by each of the Equityholders of each
such Acquired Corporation at the time of the Closing; (B) the difference
between the amounts set forth in _clause (i)_ and _clause (ii)_ above shall
be determined without regard to any item of income, gain, loss, deduction,
or credit of any Equityholder, other than the items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction attributable to the transactions set forth in _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ above; (C) to the extent applicable, each Equityholder and
Acquired Corporation shall be assumed to have elected out of reporting any
gain realized in the transactions described in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_
above under the installment method described in Section 453 of the Code; (D)
each Equityholder shall be treated as subject to state income Tax only in the
state of residence set forth next to the name of such Equityholder on
_Schedule 8.6(d)_ with respect to amounts that are or would be payable by each
Equityholder under _clauses (i)(Y)_ and _(ii)_ above; (E) it shall be
assumed that state income Taxes are not deductible for purposes of calculating
federal income Tax liabilities; and (F) to the extent a Preliminary Tax
Adjustment is not paid at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(iv)_, the
amount of such Preliminary Tax Adjustment (to the extent on Election is
ultimately made) shall be increased by any penalties or interest payable by
the Equityholders attributable to such delay, determined by assuming the
Equityholders will pay Taxes giving rise to such Preliminary Tax Adjustment on
the date such Preliminary Tax Adjustment is actually paid and assuming that if
such Preliminary Tax Adjustments were paid on the Closing the Equityholders
would have paid the Taxes giving rise to such Preliminary Tax Adjustment on
the Closing.

(e) If an Interim Tax Adjustment for any Acquired Corporation reflects an
amount greater than the respective Preliminary Tax Adjustment for such
Acquired Corporation, Parent will, within five Business Days after the
determination thereof, pay to the Representative for the benefit of the
Equityholders of such Acquired Corporation in proportion to their former
ownership of such Acquired Corporation an aggregate amount (the " _Final
Tax Payment_ ") equal to the result obtained by subtracting such Preliminary
Tax Adjustment from such Interim Tax Adjustment. If such Interim Tax
Adjustment reflects an amount less than such Preliminary Tax Adjustment, the
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders of such Acquired Corporation
in proportion to their former ownership of such Acquired Corporation will,
within five Business Days after the determination thereof, pay to Parent an
aggregate amount equal to the result obtained by subtracting such Interim Tax
Adjustment from such Preliminary Tax Adjustment. Any such payments will be
made by wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds.

 

(f) If following the calculation and payment of a Final Tax Payment there is
any change in the amount described in  _Section 8.6(d) _(including any
penalties or interest determined to be owed by the Equityholders to any taxing
authority) by reason of (i) the passage of legislation with retroactive
effect, (ii) a reduction in the amount of the Escrow Amount payable to the
Equityholders, (iii) an adjustment by a taxing authority, or (iv) any other
reason,

 



51  the parties shall in good faith and using the procedures described in the
preceding paragraphs, recalculate any relevant Interim Tax Adjustment
(including any penalties or interest determined to be owed by the
Equityholders to any taxing authority) and Parent shall pay the Representative
for the benefit of the Equityholders of such Acquired Corporation in
proportion to their former ownership of such Acquired Corporation, or
the Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders of such Acquired
Corporation in proportion to their former ownership of such Acquired
Corporation, shall pay Parent, as the case may be, the amount of any
difference. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event an
Election is invalid, the Equityholders of such Acquired Corporation with
respect to which such election is invalid will make their best efforts to file
for refunds and return (through the Representative) to the Parent an amount
up to the total amounts paid pursuant to _Section 8.6_ received by such
Equityholder in respect of such Acquired Corporation but only to the extent
such Equityholder actually receives cash refunds of Taxes attributable
to such election being invalid. In determining the amount of such cash
refunds to be returned to the Parent, neither the Representative nor the
Equityholders shall take any action or cause any action to be taken to reduce
the amount otherwise available for return to the Parent.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt (A) Parent shall be responsible for all
Corporate Level Taxes resulting from any Election, and (B) subject to clause
_(F)_ of _Section 8.6(d)_ each Preliminary Tax Adjustment and Interim Tax
Adjustment (and any subsequent adjustments thereto) shall not take into
account (and shall be calculated by ignoring) any difference in the timing of
any Tax which may be (or may have been) due and payable by any Equityholder.

Section 8.7 _Tax Treatment and Purchase Price Allocation with Respect to
Bakeast Partnership_. The parties agree to treat the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with respect to the sale of Bakeast Partnership in
accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation #2), (a) with
respect to the Equityholders of interests in Bakeast Partnership, as a sale of
partnership interests and (b) with respect to Parent and Purchaser, as a
purchase by Parent of all of the assets of Bakeast Partnership attributable to
such interests sold by the Equityholders and assumption by Parent of all of
the liabilities attributable to such interests sold by the
Equityholders (other than liabilities for which Purchaser or Parent is
required to be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement). As promptly as
practicable after the final determination of the purchase price set forth in
_Section 2.2(a)_ allocable to the Bakeast Partnership (and all other
allocable costs), the Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and shall submit to Parent, (x) a balance sheet of Bakeast Partnership, as of
the Closing Date, that sets out the tax basis of the assets owned by Bakeast
Partnership on the Closing Date and the amount of the liabilities of Bakeast
Partnership on the Closing Date (the " _Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ ") including
such information regarding any interest in Subsidiaries owned by Bakeast
Partnership and the assets owned by such Subsidiaries and (y) a balance sheet
of Bakeast Partnership, as of the Closing Date, that sets out the fair market
value of the assets owned by Bakeast Partnership on the Closing Date and the
amount of the liabilities of Bakeast Partnership on the Closing Date (the "
_Fair Market Value Balance Sheet_ "). The Fair Market Value Balance Sheet
shall (i) be computed by reference to the principles for the allocation of
the purchase price allocable to Bakeast Partnership attached hereto as
_Schedule 8.7_ and (ii) contain sufficient detail to permit the Parties to
make the computations and adjustments for purposes of applying Section 751 of
the Code to the Equityholders of Bakeast Partnership and Section 1060 of the
Code to Purchaser. The parties shall cooperate to update the Fair Market Value
Balance Sheet to reflect any further 

 



52  adjustments to the purchase price set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ allocated
to Bakeast Partnership in a manner consistent with the principles used to
create the Fair Market Value Balance Sheet. The parties shall report the Tax
consequences of the sale of the Bakeast Partnership pursuant to this Agreement
consistent with the Tax Basis Balance Sheet, the Fair Market Value Balance
Sheet and Revenue Ruling 99-6, and shall not take any action or position that
is inconsistent therewith, other than for financial reporting purposes.

Section 8.8  _Tax Refunds_. The Equityholders shall be entitled to receive
from Parent, Purchaser, the Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries all
refunds (or credits for overpayments) of Taxes by the Acquired Entities and
their Subsidiaries, including any interest thereon, attributable to taxable
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, net of any
reasonable costs incurred by Parent, Purchaser, the Acquired Entities or their
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in obtaining such refund. Promptly upon the
actual receipt of any such Tax refund (or the actual credit for overpayment),
and in no event later than five Business Days after receipt by Parent,
Purchaser, the Acquired Entities or any of their Subsidiaries, Parent will
deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such
Tax refunds (or credits for overpayments), including any interest thereon, to
the Representative for the benefit of the Equityholders of such Acquired
Entity in proportion to their former ownership of such Acquired Entity. Upon
the written request from the Representative, Purchaser or Parent shall, as
soon as is reasonably practicable, cause the Acquired Entities or their
Subsidiaries to file an amended Tax Return or application for Tax refund in
order to obtain a Tax refund (or credit for overpayment) that the
Equityholders are entitled to pursuant to this _Section 8.8_, and Parent,
Purchaser, the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries shall execute all
other documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary for Parent, Purchaser, the Acquired Entities and
their Subsidiaries to claim any Tax refund contemplated by this _Section
8.8_.

Section 8.9 _Post-Closing Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, including _Section 8.1(b)_, in no event shall Parent or Purchaser
file or amend any Tax Return of the Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries
for any taxable year ending on or before the Closing Date or affirmatively
initiate a Tax controversy without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the
portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than transactions
expressly contemplated hereby, Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Entities and their Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in the
Ordinary Course of Business in the same manner as previously conducted.
Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall cause the Acquired Corporations to make
any election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code or any similar provision
of state or local Law. A breach by Parent or Purchaser of the obligations in
the second or third sentences of this  _Section 8.9_ shall relieve the
Equityholders of their indemnification obligations under this Agreement for
any Taxes arising as a result of such action.

Section 8.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Purchaser. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes, including joining in the execution of any such Tax Return or
other documentation where

 



53  necessary. Purchaser and the Representative shall, upon request of the other
party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Transfer Tax. The parties shall cooperate in preparing and
timely filing any Tax Return or similar forms relating to Transfer Taxes and
shall promptly provide one another copies of such Tax Returns or similar
forms and reasonable evidence that all such Transfer Taxes have been timely
paid.

Section 8.11  _Section 754 Election_. The Equityholders and the Acquired
Corporations agree to timely make, or cause to be timely made, an election in
accordance with Section 754 of the Code for Green Mountain Baking Company
L.P.; CK Trucking, LLC; and CK Sales Co., LLC (collectively, the " _Electing
Partnerships_ "), so as to adjust the basis of property of the Electing
Partnerships in the case of a distribution of property of the Electing
Partnerships within the meaning of Section 734 of the Code, and in the case
of a transfer of an interest in the Electing Partnerships within the meaning
of Section 743 of the Code. Each of the members associated with the Electing
Partnerships shall supply the information necessary to give effect to the
Section 754 election of the Code.

Section 8.12 _GAAP and Tax Treatment_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article VIII_ , any position or action taken by the Parent
or Purchaser (other, except as required under applicable Law, than in respect
of preparation of any Tax Return) as required for GAAP purposes shall not
violate any provision of this Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section 8.6_. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VIII_ , any position or action taken by the Parent or Purchaser as
required by applicable Law shall not violate any provision of this Agreement,
including for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.6_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , each
Equityholder hereby covenants and agrees that to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, such Equityholder will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Parent,

(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") for, from and against

than such Equityholders Pro Rata Portion of any Losses, such Equityholder
shall have the right to seek contribution from the Equityholders that paid
less than their Pro Rata Portion of such Losses. This _Section 10.1_ shall
not apply to Losses related to Taxes, which shall be the subject of _Section
8.2_.

(b) No examination, inspection or audit of the properties, financial condition
or other matters of the Acquired Entities, Subsidiaries and the Business
conducted by Parent, or Purchaser in connection with this Agreement will in
any way limit, affect or impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to rely on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Acquired
Entities or the Equityholders that are contained in this Agreement, the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the Ancillary Agreements (except with
respect to the Merger Agreement, for which indemnification under such
agreement is governed by the Merger Agreement).

 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification by Parent and Purchaser_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _Article X_, Parent and Purchaser hereby
covenant and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, they will
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Entities, Subsidiaries, and
the Equityholders, and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and Affiliates and successors and assigns of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") for, from and against any
and all Losses actually sustained by any of such Persons following the
Closing resulting from:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser in
_Articles V_ or _VIII_ ;

 



56 (b) any breach by Parent or Purchaser of any agreement or covenant contained
in this Agreement;

(c) any Preliminary Tax Adjustment, Interim Tax Adjustment or Corporate Level
Taxes, as provided in _Article VIII_ ; and/or

(d) any claim by any Person for any brokerage or finders fee, commission or
similar payment based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by such Person with Parent or Purchaser or any Affiliate or
representative thereof in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 10.3 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. Except as provided in
_Article VIII:_

 

(a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. As soon as is reasonably practicable after
a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable
under the circumstances, the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware of any claim that it has
under _Section 10.1_ or  _Section 10.2_ hereof that may result in a Loss (a
" _Liability Claim_ "), it will give notice thereof (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to
either the Equityholders through the Representative or Purchaser as may be
applicable under the circumstances (as applicable under the circumstances, the
Equityholders or Purchaser, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). A Claims Notice
will describe the Liability Claim in reasonable detail, and will indicate the
amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Loss that
has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay in or failure
to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 10.3(a)_ will adversely affect any of the other
rights or remedies that the Indemnified Party has under this Agreement, or
alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or failure has not
materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b)  _Opportunity to Defend_. The Indemnifying Party will have the right,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of
receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement or
assertion of any Liability Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, to assume and conduct the defense of such Liability Claim in
accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel selected
by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Liability Claim solely seeks (and
continues to seek) monetary damages and (ii) the Indemnifying Party expressly
agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party will be solely obligated to satisfy and
discharge the Liability Claim (as finally determined pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article X_ ) in accordance with the limits set forth in
this Agreement (the conditions set forth in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ are
collectively referred to as the " _Litigation Conditions_ "). If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Liability Claim in
accordance with this _Section 10.3(b)_, the Indemnified Party may continue to
defend the Liability Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
of a Liability Claim as provided in this  _Section 10.3(b)_, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection

 



57  with the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that if (i) any of the
Litigation Conditions cease to be met, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Liability Claim,
the Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party
will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in
connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be, will have the right to participate in (but not control), at its
own expense, the defense of any Liability Claim which the other is defending
as provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if it will have
assumed the defense of any Liability Claim as provided in this Agreement, will
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Liability
Claim that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete release
from all liability in respect of such Liability Claim or (ii) grants any
injunctive or equitable relief. The Indemnified Party will have the right to
settle any Liability Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party, in its discretion exercised in good faith and upon advice
of counsel, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time
and upon such terms as the Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable,
provided that at least 10 days prior to any such settlement, written notice of
its intention to settle is given to the Indemnifying Party. 

Section 10.4 _Survivability; Limitations_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Acquired Entities and the
Equityholders contained in this Agreement will survive for a period ending 18
months after the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided, however_
, that (i) the expiration date for any Liability Claim relating to a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_
(Organization), _Section 4.2_ (Authorization; Validity; Execution and
Delivery; Enforceability), _Section 4.5_ (Capital Structure), _Section 4.8_
(Taxes),  _Section 4.9_ (Ownership of Assets and Leases), _Section 4.17_
(Employee Matters), _Section 4.24_ (Brokers; Expenses), and _Article VIII_
(Tax Matters) of this Agreement will be 30 days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (such representations and warranties and
_Article VIII_ , the " _Fundamental Representations_ "); (ii) the expiration
period for any Liability Claim relating to a breach or violation of _Section
4.20_ (Environmental Matters) of this Agreement will be a period of four years
after the Closing Date; and (iii) any Liability Claim pending on any
Expiration Date for which a Claims Notice has been given in accordance with
_Section 10.3_ on or before such Expiration Date may continue to be asserted
and indemnified against until finally resolved.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 10.4(c)_ and _Section 10.4(d)_: (i) the
Equityholders will not have any liability for Losses arising under _Section
10.1(a)_ of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate of all such Losses
for which indemnification is sought under _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Agreement
(other than Excluded Claims or Environmental Claims), together with any
Losses for which indemnification is sought under Section 10.1(a) of the Merger
Agreement (other than Excluded Claims and Environmental Claims under the
Merger Agreement), exceeds $1,500,000.00 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), after
which Parent and Purchaser will be entitled to be fully indemnified for all
Losses under _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Agreement exceeding the Threshold
Amount, subject to the Cap (as defined below) and (ii) the Equityholders will
not have any liability for any Losses under _Section 10.1(a)_ of this
Agreement to the extent that Losses for which indemnification is sought under
this Agreement, plus the total amount of Losses for which indemnification is
sought against the Shareholders under the Merger Agreement, exceed
$17,500,000.00 (the " _Cap_ ").

 



58 (c) Losses arising pursuant to any matter constituting fraud under applicable
Law by the Acquired Entities, Subsidiaries, or Equityholders or arising
pursuant to a breach or violation of a Fundamental Representation
(collectively, " _Excluded Claims_ ") or _Section 4.20_ (Environmental
Matters) and Section 4.20 (Environmental Matters) of the Merger Agreement
(collectively, " _Environmental Claims_ ") will not be subject to the
Threshold Amount or the Cap.

 

(d) The Equityholders will not have any liability for Losses for Environmental
Claims arising under _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Agreement and Section 10.1(a)
of the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Environmental Losses_ ") unless
and until the aggregate of all Environmental Losses for which indemnification
is sought under  _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Agreement and Section 10.1(a) of
the Merger Agreement exceeds $750,000.00 (the " _Environmental Threshold
Amount_ "), after which Parent and Purchaser will be entitled to be
fully indemnified for all Environmental Losses under _Section 10.1(a)_ of
this Agreement and Section 10.1(a) of the Merger Agreement exceeding the
Environmental Threshold Amount, subject to the Environmental Cap (as defined
below) and (ii) the Equityholders will not have any liability for any
Environmental Losses under _Section 10.1(a)_ of this Agreement and Section
10.1(a) of the Merger Agreement to the extent that Environmental Losses for
which indemnification is sought under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
exceed $25,000,000.00 (the " _Environmental Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Environmental Cap will be reduced to $7,500,000.00 on the
day immediately following the termination of the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Article X_ ,
except with respect to Excluded Claims and Environmental Losses, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of indemnification shall be by
making a claim pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In addition,
Purchaser Indemnified Parties may not seek to collect payment directly from
the Equityholders or the Representative for indemnification for any Losses
(including without limitation Losses under _Article VIII_, Excluded Claims
and Environmental Claims), unless and only to the extent that all of the
proceeds of the Escrow Account have been released or are the subject of a
previous claim by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or by Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may not seek to collect payment directly from the
Equityholders or the Representative for indemnification for any Environmental
Losses to the extent that (a) the aggregate amount of indemnification for any
Environmental Losses that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have sought to
collect directly from the Equityholders or the Representative under this
Agreement, plus (b) the aggregate amount of indemnification for any
Environmental Losses that the Parent Indemnified Parties have sought to
collect directly from the Shareholders or the Representative pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, exceeds $7,500,000.00. Nothing in this _Section 10.4(f)_
shall limit the Purchaser Indemnified Parties rights to make a claim
pursuant to terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



59 (g) The Equityholders will not have any liability for Environmental Losses
resulting from the first discovery of Hazardous Materials through the conduct
of environmental assessments, including Phase I Environmental Site
Assessments, Phase II Environmental Site Assessments or any environmental
testing or sampling (including, without limitation, soil, sediment, soil
vapor, groundwater or indoor air sampling) (collectively "Environmental
Tests") after the Closing Date at, on or under the Real Property, unless such
Environmental Tests were undertaken: (i) in order to determine the scope or
extent of Losses related to an Environmental Loss the first discovery of which
was not made through Environmental Tests other than those described in clauses
(ii) through (vii) of this Section 10.4(g); (ii) in response to an inquiry,
request, claim or demand by a Governmental Authority; (iii) during the
renovation or reconstruction or expansion of any structures or buildings on
any of the Real Property, to the extent such Environmental Test is required
by applicable Law; (iv) as required by applicable Environmental Laws; (v) if
required by a lender as a condition of financing or by an insurance carrier
for purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance (other than environmental
insurance), (vi) which is necessary to defend a claim by a third party against
the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party or to prosecute a previously
noticed claim for indemnification hereunder, (vii) to respond
to, investigate, or otherwise remediate environmental conditions that present
an endangerment to the health, safety or welfare of any person, the public or
the environment.

(h) The indemnification obligations of the parties hereto pursuant to this
_Article X_ will be limited to actual Losses and will not include incidental,
consequential, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary Losses, except to the
extent any such incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive, special or
exemplary Losses are part of a claim made by a third party against an
Indemnified Party.

 

(i) Each Indemnified Party will take and will cause their respective
Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize
any Loss to the maximum extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Loss.

(j) For the purposes of calculating Losses and determining the failure of any
representations and warranties or covenant to be true and correct, any
materiality qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements will be disregarded.

Section 10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification rights provided in
_Section 8.2_, _Article VIII_ and this _Article X_ will be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the parties hereto for any and all Losses
related to a breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties contained herein, or any right, claim or action
arising from the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party hereby
waives and releases, to the fullest extent that it may do so, any other right
or remedy that may arise under any Law); _provided_ that the provisions of
this _Section 10.5_ will not preclude any party from bringing an action for
specific performance, or any other equitable remedy to require any other
party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement hereto.

Section 10.6  _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. For the avoidance of
doubt, all indemnification and similar payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase
price as set forth in  _Section 2.2(a)_ in respect of the applicable
Acquired Entity or Subsidiary, to the extent permissible under applicable Tax
Law.

this Agreement and the Closing, including, without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, all fees and expenses of brokers,

clearly specified to the contrary herein. Disclosure in any section of the
Schedules of any facts or circumstances shall be made with respect to all
representations and warranties by the Acquired Entities or the Equityholders
calling for disclosure of such information, only to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on the face of the Schedules that such disclosure is
applicable. Further, inclusion of any item on any Schedule (a) does not
represent a determination that such item is material nor will it be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality, (b) does not represent a determination
that such item did not arise in the Ordinary Course of Business, (c) does not
represent a determination that the transactions contemplated by 

 



63  this Agreement require the consent of third parties, and (d) will not
constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third party concerning
such item. To the extent that the Schedules include descriptions of
instruments or brief summaries of certain aspects of the Acquired Entities,
the Subsidiaries and their business and operations, the descriptions and brief
summaries are not necessarily complete and are provided in the Schedules to
identify documents or other materials previously delivered or made available.

Section 12.9 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement (together with
the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the Ancillary Agreements) constitutes
the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes and cancels any
prior agreements, representations, warranties, or communications, whether
oral or written, among the parties hereto relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the subject matter herein. Neither this Agreement nor
any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,
but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom or which
the enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought.

Section 12.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Any legal suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in
any federal court in Portland, Maine and each party hereto waives any

hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court in Portland,
Maine in any action, suit or proceeding.

 

Section 12.11 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH OF PARENT, PURCHASER, THE
ACQUIRED ENTITIES, THE SUBSIDIARIES AND THE EQUITYHOLDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, PURCHASER, THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES AND
THE EQUITYHOLDERS IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. In any action brought by a party hereto to enforce the
obligations of any other party or parties hereunder, the prevailing party will
be entitled to collect from the other parties to such action such partys
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees, court costs and other expenses
incidental to such litigation.

 

Section 12.12 _Dispute Resolution_. Except for actions for specific
performance, injunction or other equitable remedies contemplated by this
Agreement, any dispute or difference between the parties arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which
the parties are unable to resolve themselves will be submitted to
and resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator, for amounts in
dispute under $500,000.00 and otherwise before a panel of three arbitrators,
pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, as supplemented or modified by the provisions of this _Section
12.12_. The arbitrator(s) will consider the dispute at issue in Portland,
Maine within 120 days (or such other period as may be acceptable to the
parties to the dispute) of the designation of the arbitrator(s). The
arbitrator(s) will be bound to follow the laws of the State of Delaware,
decisional and statutory, in reaching any decision and making any award and
will deliver a

 



64  written award, including written findings of fact and conclusions of law,
with respect to the dispute to each of the parties, who will promptly act in
accordance therewith. In no event will the arbitrator(s) have the power to
award damages in connection with any dispute in excess of actual compensatory
damages. In particular, the arbitrator(s) may not multiply actual damages or
award consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages, including damages
for lost profits or loss of business opportunity. Any award of the
arbitrator(s) will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties; _provided_
that any such party may seek the vacating, modification or correction of
the arbitrator(s) decision or award as provided under Section 10 and Section
11 of the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. § 1 _et seq_. Any party may enforce
any award rendered pursuant to the arbitration provisions of this  _Section
12.12_ by bringing suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing
party in such arbitration will be entitled to recover from each other party in
such dispute reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the
prevailing party, and all costs and expenses attributable to the arbitrator(s)
will be allocated among the parties in such manner as the arbitrator(s)
determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. Any party may file a copy
of this _Section 12.12_ with any arbitrator or court as written evidence of
the knowing, voluntary and bargained-for agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this _Section 12.12_.

 

Section 12.13 _Severability_. Any provision hereof which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by Law, the parties hereto waive any provision of Law which renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

 

Section 12.14 _Construction_. The parties and their respective counsel have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
addition, each of the parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has
been advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary,
other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
The headings preceding the text of articles and sections included in this
Agreement and the headings to the Schedules and Exhibits are for convenience
only and are not to be deemed part of this Agreement or given effect in
interpreting this Agreement. References to sections, articles, Schedules or
Exhibits are to the sections, articles, Schedules and Exhibits contained in,
referred to or attached to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. The
word "including" means "including without limitation." The use of the
masculine, feminine or neuter gender or the singular or plural form of words
will not limit any provisions of this Agreement. 

Section 12.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 12.16 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
