the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall bring current (in
accordance with then-existing contract and invoice payment terms) all
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of the Company Group
to reflect the amounts thereof immediately prior to the Closing.   

(b) Within 180 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall
prepare and deliver to the Member Representative a statement (the "
_Statement_ "), certified by an officer of the Surviving Company, setting
forth Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Date Working
Capital_ "). During the 30-day period following the Member Representatives
receipt of the Statement, the Member Representative shall be permitted to
review the working papers relating to the Statement, and the Statement shall
become final and binding upon the Parties hereto on the 30th day following
delivery thereof to the Member Representative unless the Member
Representative gives to Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") with the Statement prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on Closing Date Working Capital not being
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (iii) be
accompanied by a certificate of the Member Representative that it
has complied with this _Section 3.7_ and (iv) be accompanied by a
certificate of the Member Representatives independent auditors confirming
and concurring with each of the positions taken by the Member Representative

Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised, if necessary, in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the
Parties hereto on the earlier of (A) the date Buyer and the Member
Representative resolve in writing all differences they have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date all
disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Buyer and the Member Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing all differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, if
Buyer and the Member Representative have not resolved in writing all
differences that they have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and the Member Representative shall submit to
an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration any
and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly included in the
Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm agreed upon by Buyer and the Member
Representative in writing. Judgment may be entered upon the determination
of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any
arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this 
_Section 3.7_ shall be borne by Buyer and the Member Representative in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting
Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and
disbursements of the Member Representatives independent auditors incurred in
connection with their review of the Statement and certification of any Notice
of Disagreement shall be borne by the Member Representative, and the fees and
disbursements of Buyers independent auditors incurred in connection with
their review of the Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne
by Buyer. Any determinations by the Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses
performed by the Accounting Firm, in connection with its arbitration of any
dispute under this _Section 3.7_ shall not be admissible in evidence in any
suit, action or proceeding between the Parties hereto other than to the extent
necessary to enforce payment obligations under this _Section 3.7(b)_.   

(c) The Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the amount by which Closing
Date Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target (the Merger
Consideration as so decreased, the " _Adjusted Merger Consideration_ "). If
the Adjusted Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Date Payment,
Buyer shall, within ten business days after the Statement becomes final
and binding on the Parties hereto, make payment to the Member Representative,
for the benefit of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds in the amount of such excess. If
Adjusted Merger Consideration is less than the Closing Date Payment, Buyer
shall be entitled to an indemnity payment in the amount of such deficiency
in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)(i)(E)_. Any payment under this _Section
3.7(c)_ shall be made together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the
rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.   

Section 3.8. _Satisfaction of Conditions_. All conditions to the obligations
of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub to proceed with the Closing under this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been fully and completely satisfied or
waived for all purposes upon the Closing.   

Section 3.9. _Transfer Taxes_. Liability for Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the documents giving effect to such transactions shall be
shared, 50% by Buyer, on the one hand, and 50% by the Company, on the other
hand.   

ARTICLE IV.    

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY GROUP_     

The Company represents and warrants to Buyer, except as set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule (and subject to _Section 11.5_), as follows:   

Section 4.1. _Organization of the Company and the Company Group_. The Company
is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware, and the Company has all requisite
limited liability power and authority to carry on its business as it is
currently conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties where
such properties are now owned, leased or operated. Each other member of the
Company Group (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and (b) has all
requisite organizational power and authority to carry on its respective
business as it is currently conducted and to own, lease and operate its
properties where such properties are now owned, leased or operated, except in
all cases where any failures of the representations in this sentence to be
true would not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Group. Each
member of the Company Group is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed or in good standing would not and would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company Group.   

Section 4.2. _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite limited liability
company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be party and to perform
its obligations hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Company is or will be a Party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been, or will be at the time of
execution, duly authorized by the Members, pursuant to the LLC Agreement and
the DLLCA. No other limited liability company or member proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement, such
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub) constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exception.   

Section 4.3. _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with the LLC Agreement,
(b) subject to the Consents described in _Section 4.6(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, violate or result in a breach of any Material Contract, or (c)
subject to the Consents of Governmental Authorities described in _Section
4.6(e)_, violate any Law to which any member of the Company Group is subject,
except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), for such violations or breaches
which would not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Group.

Phantom Units or Assigned Hurdle Units upon, and in exchange for, payments to
the holders thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
nothing in any such award agreement entitles holders of Restricted Common
Units, Phantom Common Units, Preferred Phantom Units or Assigned Hurdle

Liabilities to be funded by Buyer to the Company at Closing under _Section
3.6(b)_ and (ii) an estimate of the amount of Working Capital, calculated in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.7_ (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ "), which statement shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.   

Section 6.7. _Director and Officer Indemnification_. For six (6) years from
and after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
and the organizational documents of the Company immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Companys Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Surviving Company Group_ ") to
indemnify and hold harmless the officers, managers and directors of
any member of the Company Group who held any such position at any time on or
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Indemnified Officers_ "), to
the same extent as such Indemnified Officers are indemnified by the Company
Group on the date hereof, in respect of acts or omission occurring prior to
the Closing, and Buyer shall cause the applicable member of the
Surviving Company Group to maintain for six (6) years from and after the
Closing indemnification provisions in its organizational documents that are
no less favorable to the Indemnified Officers than those in effect with
respect to such member of the Company Group immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement. Buyer shall cause to be obtained and maintained in effect,
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, policies of directors and
officers liability insurance protecting the Indemnified Officers with
coverages and containing terms and conditions (including with respect
to deductible, amount and payment of attorneys fees) that are no less
favorable than those in existing policies of the Company as of the date
hereof. Buyer may, at its option, select the insurance broker for effecting
such insurance policies. The Company shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to acquire a six (6) year tail policy for the Persons currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
that is consistent with the second preceding sentence. Such policy shall be
prepaid at the Closing and shall be non-cancelable. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees that
from and after the Closing Date each Indemnified Officer shall be a third
party beneficiary under this Agreement for purposes of enforcing this
_Section 6.7_.   

Section 6.8. _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.   

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company Group to, honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all
Liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to or in respect of each of the
employees (including those employees who are full-time, part-time, temporary,
on vacation or on a paid or unpaid leave of absence) of any member of the
Company Group and the directors of any member of the Company Group (in each
case, as determined as of the Closing Date) (collectively, the " _Company
Group Employees_ ") arising under the terms of any Company Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of
such Company Plan.   

(b) Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, for a period of not less than one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company Group
to, provide each Company Group Employee who continues employment with a
member of the Surviving Company Group or any of its Affiliates with
compensation and benefits (including with respect to severance and annual
bonus opportunities but excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that
are not less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits
provided to such Company Group Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company Group to,
cause each employee benefit plan (including, but not limited to, each
severance plan or arrangement) maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates and in which a Company Group Employee participates, solely
to the extent that Buyer makes such plan available to such Company Group
Employee, provide credit for any employee co-payments or similar amounts and
to recognize all service of such Company Group Employee with any member of
the Company Group for purposes of eligibility and vesting (except that such
service (i) shall not be counted to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits, (ii) shall be counted for eligibility only for
applicable Buyer severance plans and arrangements and (iii) shall not be
counted for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) and,
if applicable, to waive any exclusions for preexisting conditions under any
such health or welfare plans.   

(c) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a
Restricted Common Unit, Common Phantom Unit, Preferred Phantom Unit or
Assigned Hurdle Unit (or former holder of a Restricted Common Unit, Common
Phantom Unit, Preferred Phantom Unit or Assigned Hurdle Unit) or any
Participant shall have any right under any Company Plan to acquire any equity
interests or voting securities of any member of the Company Group or the
Surviving Company Group (including "phantom" equity or equity appreciation
rights).   

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 6.8_,
whether express or implied, shall, in and of itself, (i) constitute or create
an employment agreement with any Company Group Employee, (ii) be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan or any other plan or
arrangement covering the Company Group Employees, or (iii) limit the right
of Buyer to amend, terminate or otherwise modify, or to cause the Surviving
Company Group to amend, terminate or otherwise modify, any existing benefit
plan or arrangement following the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section
6.8_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement, including no third party beneficiary rights in
any current or former Company Group Employee or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof.   

Section 6.9. _Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records_. From and after
the Closing, Buyer will cooperate in good faith with the holders of Units and
the holders of Phantom Units in respect of Tax matters (including Actions
with respect to Taxes); _provided, however_ , that such cooperation shall not
interfere with the normal operations of the Surviving Company Group and the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Surviving Company Group incurred in
connection therewith will be paid by such holder of Units or Phantom Units.
Buyer will cause the Surviving Company Group to maintain and preserve all Tax
Returns, books, records and other documents that are reasonably necessary for
such cooperation for the lesser of (i) seven (7) years after the Closing Date
and (ii) any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same
may be extended.   

Section 6.10. _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees that from time to time
after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its respective
Affiliates to execute and deliver such further instruments, and take (or
cause their respective Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents.   

Section 6.11. _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date
or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, neither the
Company nor the Member Representative will, and the Company shall cause each
other member of the Company Group and any officer, director, employee,
representative, agent and advisor of any member of the Company Group not to
(a) directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any inquiries or proposals
for, or enter into or continue any discussions with respect to, the
acquisition (including by merger, recapitalization or similar transaction) by
any Person (other than a holder of Units or Phantom Units, as permitted by
_Section 6.1_) of any of the Units, Phantom Units or other
membership interest (or phantom membership interest) or other securities of
any other member of the Company Group or any of the assets of the Company
Group material to the Business (an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), or (b)
furnish or permit to be furnished any non-public information concerning the
Company Group or its Business to any Person (other than Buyer, Merger Sub or
their Affiliates and respective agents and representatives), other than
information furnished in the ordinary course of business. Each of the Company
and the Member Representative shall promptly notify Buyer of any inquiry or
proposal received by it or its representatives with respect to any such
Acquisition Transaction.   

Section 6.12. _Supplemental Disclosure_. Up to five (5) days prior to the
scheduled Closing Date, the Company may correct or supplement in writing any
information furnished in the Disclosure Schedule, including any information
that is materially incorrect or incomplete as a result of any facts or
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof, and shall
promptly furnish such supplemented information to Buyer. Thereafter, prior to
the Closing, the Company shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any
additional corrections or supplements to the Disclosure Schedule. Any such
corrected or supplemental information shall not be deemed to amend this
Agreement for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing
condition set forth in  _Section 7.3(a)_ or for purposes of determining
whether any person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article
VIII_.   

Section 6.13. _Tax Treatment of Transactions_. To the extent the Company
ceases to be classified as a partnership for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated for all U.S.
Federal income Tax purposes as a sale by the Members of partnership interests
of the Company and as a purchase by Buyer of the assets and liabilities of
the Company.   

Section 6.14. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer and the Member Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to enter into an agreement on or after the
Closing Date concerning the allocation of the Merger Consideration (including
any adjustments thereto) and the assumed liabilities among the assets of the
Company for Tax purposes (such allocation, which shall be in accordance with
Federal Tax principles, the " _Allocation_ "), and the Allocation shall be
made pursuant to the following procedure:   

       | (a)  |   | as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the Member Representative a proposed
Allocation (such proposed Allocation, the " _Proposed Allocation_ ");  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | the Member Representative may object to the
Proposed Allocation in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
delivery of the Proposed Allocation but only if such objection, if sustained,
would result in (i) a reduction of the aggregate amount of the Proposed
Allocation that is allocated to those assets the deemed disposition of which
results in short-term capital gain or ordinary income for tax purposes ("
_Ordinary Income Assets_ ") for the Members and (ii) a corresponding increase
in the aggregate amount of the Proposed Allocation that is allocated to
assets other than Ordinary Income Assets (each such objection, a "
_Permissible Objection_ ") (it being understood that the term Permissible
Objection shall encompass an objection regarding the allocation of a portion
of the Merger Consideration to a covenant not to compete); the Member
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Proposed
Allocation (and the Proposed Allocation shall become the Allocation and shall
be binding on Buyer, the Member Representative and the Members for all
purposes) if such notice is not delivered to the Buyer within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the Buyers delivery of the Proposed Allocation;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (c)  |   | if the Member Representative provides timely
notice to Buyer, in accordance with _Section 6.14(b)_, that it objects to
the Proposed Allocation, then Buyer and the Member Representative shall
negotiate in good faith about any Permissible Objection for fifteen (15) days
after the delivery of such notice;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (d)  |   | if Buyer and the Member Representative agree to
amend the Proposed Allocation as a result of reaching a written agreement
about a Permissible Objection, then the Proposed Allocation, as so amended,
shall become the Allocation and shall be binding on Buyer and the Members for
all Tax purposes;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (e)  |   | if Buyer and the Member Representative cannot
reach written agreement amending the Proposed Allocation within the fifteen
(15) day period set forth in _Section 6.14(c)_, then all unresolved
Permissible Objections shall be immediately submitted for resolution to the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall make a final determination as to
those unresolved Permissible Objections within thirty (30) days after
such submission. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
shared equally between the Member Representative and the Buyer;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (f)  |   | the determinations of the Accounting Firm shall
be final and binding on Buyer, the Members and the Member Representative for
all Tax purposes; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (g)  |   | Buyer, the Members and the Member Representative
shall act in accordance with any Allocation resulting from the procedures set
forth in this Section 6.14 in any Tax Returns or similar filings. In the
event that any Governmental Authority disputes such Allocation, Buyer or the
Member Representative, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other
party of the nature of such dispute.  
---|---|---|---

 _INDEMNIFICATION_     

Section 8.1. _Survival_.   

(a) (i) The representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on December 31, 2008 (the "
_Survival Date_ "), (ii) the provisions of _Article VIII_, _Article IX_ and

III_ and _Sections 6.1_, _6.2(b)_ , _6.3_ , _6.4_ ,  _6.5_ , _6.7_ ,
_6.8(a)_ , _6.8(b)_ , _6.9_ , _6.10_ , _6.13_  and _6.14_. No other
representations, warranties or covenants of the Parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing. If a notice of a claim with respect to a
breach of a representation or warranty is asserted in writing and delivered
prior to the Survival Date, then such representation or warranty shall
survive solely in connection with such claim until such time as such claim is
resolved in accordance with the terms of this _Article VIII_.   

(b) If prior to the Closing any Party (the " _Waiving Party_ ") has knowledge
of any breach by any other Party of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement and, at least five (5) days prior to the Closing,
such other Party acknowledges in writing that the effect of such breach is a
failure of any condition to the Waiving Partys obligations set forth in this
Agreement and the Waiving Party proceeds with the Closing, the Waiving Party
shall be deemed to have waived such breach and the Waiving Party and its
successors, assigns and affiliates shall not be entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Article VIII_, to sue for Damages or to assert any other
right or remedy for any Damages arising from any matters relating to
such condition or breach, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto. Except as expressly
provided in this _Section 8.1(b)_ , the rights of each Buyer Indemnified
Party under _Sections 8.2(a)_, and the rights of each Member Indemnified
Party under _Section 8.2(b)_, after the Closing shall not be affected by any
knowledge at or prior to the execution of this Agreement or at or prior to
the Closing of any breach of this Agreement, whether such knowledge came from
any member of the Company Group, the Member Representative or any other
Person, or any waiver of _Section 7.2(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(a)_.   

Section 8.2. _Indemnification_.   

(a) (i) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_, after the Closing,
Buyer, Merger Sub and their Affiliates (including the Surviving Company
Group) and Buyers, Merger Subs and such Affiliates respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, members, stockholders, and each of their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification solely from the
Escrow Amount against all Damages (excluding, except in the case of Third-
Party Claims, punitive damages or loss of profits) incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or any of them arising from or as a result of:    

(A) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1_, the breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement;    

(B) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1_, the breach
or non-performance by the Company of any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement;    

(C) all Company Transaction Expenses in excess of the amount thereof deducted
from the Base Merger Consideration in arriving at the Merger
Consideration;    

(D) all Retained Liabilities in excess of the amount thereof deducted from the
Base Merger Consideration in arriving at the Merger Consideration;
and    

(E) the amount by which the Adjusted Merger Consideration is less than the
Closing Date Payment; and    

(F) any Pre-Closing Tax Liability.   

(ii) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
under _Section 8.2(a)(i)(A)_ :    

(A) unless the aggregate of all Damages for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, but for this _Section 8.2(a)(ii)(A)_, are entitled to
indemnification thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$1,250,000, after which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Damages for which they are entitled
to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)(A)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section 8.2(a)(ii)(A)_ shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of _Section 4.1_,
_4.2_ , _4.4_ ,  _4.5_ or _4.7_ ; and    

(B) for any individual items where the Damage relating thereto is less than
$100,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) such item shall be aggregated
for purposes of the calculation of cumulative Damages under _Section
8.2(a)(ii)(A)_ and (2) this clause (B) shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification arising out of a breach or alleged breach of _Section 4.1_,
_4.2_ , _4.4_ , _4.5_ or _4.7_.   

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_, after the Closing,
Buyer and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the Member
Representative, each holder of Units and each holder of Phantom Units and
each of their officers, directors, employees, partners,
members, stockholders, and each of their respective successors and assigns
(where any such status is applicable before, at or after the Closing)
(collectively, the " _Member Indemnified Parties_ ", and, together with the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
all Damages as incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties or any of them
arising from or as a result of:    

(i) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1_, the breach of
any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement; and    

(ii) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1_, the breach
or non-performance by Buyer or Merger Sub of any of its covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement.   

Section 8.3. _Indemnification Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:   

(a) If a claim for indemnification is to be made by an Indemnified Party with
respect to any claims asserted against it by an unaffiliated third-party (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") that could give rise to a right of indemnification
under this _Article VIII_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice of the Third-
Party Claim) (i) notify the Party from whom indemnification is sought (which,
in the case of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, shall
be, on behalf of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, the
Member Representative) (such notified Party, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of
the Third-Party Claim, and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim
(if any), the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this _Article VIII_, and a good-faith estimate of the amount of
Damages attributable to such claim. Failure to provide such Claim Notice
shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.   

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim, it being understood that such election
shall be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute
whether such claim involves indemnifiable Damages under this  _Article
VIII_. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party who is reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party, by all appropriate proceedings. The Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the matter without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If an Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the
Indemnified Party that exceeds, where the Indemnified Party has unreasonably
withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or
settlement of a Third-Party Claim, the amount for which that Third-Party
Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or
settlement. No Third-Party Claim that is being defended in good faith by the
Indemnifying Party shall be settled or compromised by the Indemnified Party
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding any dispute as to
liability under this _Article VIII_, if requested by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party shall act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall (in addition to, and not in limitation of, its
obligation to act in good faith), at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and
making available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under its
control (or in the possession or control of any of its Affiliates or
representatives) relating to the Third-Party Claim as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party or its counsel. The Indemnified Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-
Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
8.3(b)_, and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation; _provided, however_ , if in the opinion of
outside counsel of the Indemnified Party there is a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel to the
Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in
connection with such defense.   

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice that the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third-Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of
such defense and proceedings;  _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified
Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party
Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to (or is deemed to have elected not to) assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, or elects to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, but reserves the right to dispute whether such claim is
an indemnifiable Damage under this _Article VIII_, the determination of
whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
be resolved either by the Parties or in an appropriate legal proceeding. Upon
resolution of such dispute by the Parties or receipt of a final and non-
appealable order or determination from a court of competent jurisdiction
setting forth the resolution of such dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly pay the amount agreed in such resolution or so ordered to be paid,
if any.   

(d) With respect to any indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from
the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any claim with respect to which the Indemnified Party believes it is
or may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1_ hereof (an "
_Indemnity Notice_ "). The Indemnity Notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the nature of the claim, the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the
amount of Damages attributable to such claim and the basis of the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this _Article VIII_.   

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes such claim (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such
claim and shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to pay the amount set forth in the Indemnity Notice promptly after
the expiration of such 30-day period.   

(f) If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for indemnification
(including any Third-Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute.
If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such
dispute in thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, such dispute
shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of law in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Upon resolution of such dispute by the
Parties or receipt of a final and non-appealable order or determination from
a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the resolution of
such dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the amount agreed in
such resolution or so ordered to be paid, if any.   

(g) The term "Damages" as used in this _Article VIII_ is not limited to
matters asserted by third-parties against an Indemnified Party, but includes
Damages incurred or sustained by an Indemnified Party in the absence of
Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Partys right to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ shall not be conditioned upon the payment of amounts
by such Indemnified Party.   

Section 8.4. _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, (a) such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to obtain such indemnification solely out
of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, (b) the
aggregate Liability of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_
shall be limited to the then remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, and (c)
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall not have any recourse against the Member
Representative personally for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
and (d) such Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification
to the extent such Damages were included in the calculation of Closing Date
Working Capital.   

Section 8.5. _Calculation of Damages_.   

(a) In calculating the amount of the Damages to any Indemnified Party under
_Section 8.2_ , the amount of Damages will be net of any amounts recoverable
by the Indemnified Party from any third-party (including insurance proceeds)
as a result of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the Damages (such
amounts, a " _Reimbursement_ "). The Indemnified Parties shall pursue payment
under or from any insurer or third-party in respect of such Damages prior
to pursuing payment from any Indemnifying Party. If any Reimbursement is
obtained subsequent to payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Damages, then such Reimbursement shall be promptly paid over to the
Indemnifying Party.   

(b) Any payment made pursuant to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall
be deemed to be and treated, to the extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for all purposes.   

Section 8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for any equitable relief to which any
Party may be entitled and except in the case of fraud or as set forth in
_Section 6.7_, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions of
this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and no
Party shall pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Buyer and Merger Sub each hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company Group) may have against the Company arising under or based upon any
Law.   

Section 8.7. _Access_. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice or an
Indemnity Notice by any Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant
the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party (including
the members of the Company Group) related to the matters to which the claim
relates ( _provided_ that, as necessary to protect any attorney-client
privilege, the Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Party shall execute a
joint defense agreement containing customary terms). All such access shall be
granted during normal business hours.   

Section 8.8. _Mitigation of Damages_. The Parties shall cooperate with each
other to mitigate any Damages.   

Section 8.9. _Certain Damages_. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS, IN
NO EVENT SHALL THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING UNDER THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ ) OR THE TERM "DAMAGES" COVER OR INCLUDE
PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER BASED ON STATUTE, CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE INDEMNIFYING PARTYS SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.   

Section 8.10. _Release of Escrow Amount_. On the Survival Date the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Member Representative for distribution to the
holders of Units (other than Preferred Units) and the holders of Phantom
Units (other than Preferred Phantom Units) all or any remaining portion of
the Escrow Amount (including any interest thereon), _less_ (a) first, the
amount of any Member Allocable Expenses submitted to the Escrow Agent on or
prior to such date and payable to the Member Representative in accordance
with _Section 3.2_ and the Escrow Agreement, and then  _less_ (b) second, an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties which are properly asserted and pending on or
prior to such date. Promptly upon the resolution of a pending claim for
indemnification related to clause (b) of this  _Section 8.10_, the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Member Representative for distribution to holders
of Units (other than Preferred Units) and the holders of Phantom Units (other
than Preferred Phantom Units) any Escrow Amount (including any interest
thereon) retained in respect of such pending claim for indemnification
remaining after the resolution of such pending claim, _less_  the amount of
any Member Allocable Expenses submitted to the Escrow Agent on or prior to
such date and payable to the Member Representative in accordance with
_Section 3.2_ and the Escrow Agreement. Any distribution pursuant to this
_Section 8.10_ shall be made to each holder of Units (other than Preferred
Units) and each holder of Phantom Units (other than Preferred Phantom Units)
_pro rata_ in accordance with such holders Applicable Percentage and shall
otherwise be made in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.   

ARTICLE IX.    

 _MEMBER REPRESENTATIVE_     

Section 9.1. _Member Representative_. The Parties have agreed that it is
desirable to designate Satow Associates, LLC to act on behalf of the holders
of Units and the holders of Phantom Units for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein (the " _Member Representative_ ").   

Section 9.2. _Authority and Rights_. By the Members approval of this
Agreement and further each holder of Units and each holder of Phantom Units
submission of a letter of transmittal pursuant hereto, each of the holders of
Units and the holders of Phantom Units of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time irrevocably ratifies the designation of Satow Associates,
LLC (or any successor representative) as Member Representative as provided in
this Agreement. The Member Representative shall have such powers and
authority to take any and all actions specified in or contemplated by this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other Transaction Documents for and
on behalf of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, as fully
as such holders were acting on their own behalf, and take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Member Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing;  _provided, however_ , that the Member
Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the holders of
Units or Phantom Units, except as expressly provided herein or therein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Member Representative
shall have full power, authority and discretion to estimate and determine the
amounts of Member Allocable Expenses, and to direct the Escrow Agent to pay
such Member Allocable Expenses in accordance with _Sections 3.2_ and _8.10_
hereof. The Member Representative will at all times be entitled to rely on
any directions received from the holders of Units or Phantom Units; _provided,
however,_ that the Member Representative shall not be required to follow any
such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its
capacity as Member Representative, unless the Member Representative is
entitled to funds under _Sections 3.2_ and _8.10_ of this Agreement and/or
has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
discretion of the Member Representative, are sufficient to protect the Member
Representative against the costs, expenses and Liabilities which may be
incurred by the Member Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Member Representative shall be entitled to engage
such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem
necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Member
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions
and advice of such Persons. The Member Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Escrow Amount as set forth in _Sections 3.2_ and
_8.10_ of this Agreement and/or from funds otherwise received by it in its
capacity as Member Representative pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents
and consultants) incurred by the Member Representative in such capacity, and
for indemnification against any loss, Liability or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member Representative
(except for those arising out of the Member Representatives gross negligence
or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and
defense of claims for indemnification. All actions taken by Member
Representative under this Agreement, including but not limited to, actions
following the Closing Date with respect to all matters relating to  _Section
3.2_ and _Article VIII_ hereof and to the Escrow Agreement, shall be
binding upon all holders of Units and all holders of Phantom Units and their
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent, and, after the Closing Date, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to serve notice to, and
deal exclusively with, the Member Representative with respect to any and all
matters concerning any of the holders of Units or Phantom Units arising out
of or related to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents (except as may
otherwise expressly be set forth in such Transaction Documents) or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any holder of
Units, holder of Phantom Units or Indemnifying Party by the Member
Representative with respect thereto, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any holder of Units, holder of Phantom
Units or Indemnifying Party by the Member Representative with respect
thereto, as fully binding upon such holder of Units, holder of Phantom Units
or Indemnifying Party. If the Member Representative shall resign, dissolve,
cease to exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, the
holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units shall, within ten (10) days
after the occurrence of such event, appoint a successor representative and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify Buyer and the Escrow Agent of the identity
of such successor. Any such successor shall become the "Member
Representative" for purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. If for any reason there is no Member Representative at any time,
all references herein or in any other Transaction Document to the
Member Representative shall be deemed to refer to the holders of Units and
the holders of Phantom Units.   

Section 9.3. _Limitations on Liability_. Except in cases of willful misconduct
or fraud and except as set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_, the Member
Representative will have no Liability to the holders of Units and the holders
of Phantom Units or their successors or assigns with respect to actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member Representative and shall be
entitled to indemnification and reimbursement from the holders of Units and
the holders of Phantom Units (whether from the Escrow Amount or otherwise)
against any loss, Liability, fees or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member Representative.   

ARTICLE X.    

 _TERMINATION_     

Section 10.1. _Termination Events_. Without prejudice to other remedies which
may be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at
any time prior to the Closing:   

(a) by mutual written consent of the Member Representative and Buyer;   

(b) by either the Member Representative or Buyer by giving written notice to
the other Party if the Closing shall not have occurred by October 9, 2007,
unless extended by written agreement of the Member Representative and Buyer;
_provided_ that the Party seeking termination pursuant to this subsection (b)
is not in default or breach of any Transaction Document to which it is party
and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this subsection (b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;
or   

(c) by either the Member Representative or Buyer by giving written notice to
the other Party if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other Action
shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and non-
appealable.   

Section 10.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any Liability on the part of any
Party or its Affiliates in respect thereof, except that (a) the obligations
of the Parties under _Section 6.2_ (Access to Information; Confidentiality),
_Section 6.5_ (Public Announcements) and _Article VIII_ of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and (b) such termination shall not
relieve any Party of any Liability for any breach prior to termination of
this Agreement.

Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule) whose relevance or applicability to any
representation or warranty made elsewhere in this Agreement or to
the information called for by any other Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (or any other section of any
Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule) is
reasonably apparent on its face shall be deemed to be an exception to
such representations and warranties and to be disclosed with respect to all
Sections of and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedule (and all sections of all Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement
and the Disclosure Schedule), notwithstanding the omission of a reference or
cross-reference thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this

representations and warranties made in _Sections 4.1_ through _4.8_ or any
Section of or Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedule (or any section of any Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule) related thereto.   

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or

deemed an admission by a Party that such item represents an exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would be reasonably
likely to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company Group, Buyer or Merger Sub.   

Section 11.6. _Headings_. The table of contents and section headings contained

Section 11.8. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer
and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of the Company or any of its Affiliates

of the Company Group and its Affiliates, or with respect to any other
information provided to Buyer or Merger Sub, whether on behalf of the Company
Group or such other Persons, including as to the probable success
or profitability of the Company Group after the Closing. No holder of Units
or Phantom Units or any other Person will have or be subject to any Liability
to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer or
Merger Sub, or Buyer or Merger Subs use of, any such information, including
any information, document or material made available to Buyer or Merger Sub in
certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation or contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   

Section 11.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule and the Exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior
understandings, negotiations, agreements, discussions or representations
among the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to the extent they
relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.   

Section 11.10. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable,
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any
provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby
are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.   

Section 11.11. _Expenses_. Unless otherwise provided herein, each Party agrees
to pay, without right of reimbursement from the other Parties, all costs and
expenses incurred by it incident to the performance of its obligations
hereunder, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of
counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed
by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.   

Section 11.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of Delaware.   

Section 11.13. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.   

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
(i) state courts of the State of Delaware and (ii) the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware for the purposes of any suit, Action or
other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any Action, suit
or proceeding relating hereto except in such courts). Each of the Parties
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document hand
delivered or sent by U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective address
set forth in _Section 11.3_ will be effective service of process for
any Action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (A) state courts of the State of Delaware or (B) the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in
any such court that any such Action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action or
proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment in any jurisdiction or in any other manner provided in law or in
equity.    

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.   

Section 11.14. _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other Party would be irreparably damaged in the event that
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties hereby agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an
Injunction or Injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first Party under this Agreement, and each Party hereby agrees to waive
the defense in any such suit that the other Party have an adequate remedy at
law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety
of Injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive
any requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief.
The equitable remedies described in this _Section 11.14_ shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that
the Parties may elect to pursue. The Parties hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement required to be performed prior to the Closing are not performed
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that, prior to the
Closing, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.   

Section 11.15. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.
