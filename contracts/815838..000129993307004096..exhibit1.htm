Officers are indemnified by the Company Group on the date hereof, in respect of acts or omission
occurring prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall cause the applicable member of the Surviving
Company Group to maintain for six (6)&nbsp;years from and after the Closing indemnification provisions
in its organizational documents that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Officers than those

years after the Closing, policies of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance protecting the

the extent that Buyer makes such plan available to such Company Group Employee, provide credit for
any employee co-payments or similar amounts and to recognize all service of such Company Group
Employee with any member of the Company Group for purposes of eligibility and vesting (except that
such service (i)&nbsp;shall not be counted to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits, (ii)&nbsp;shall be counted for eligibility only for applicable Buyer severance plans and
arrangements and (iii)&nbsp;shall not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan) and, if applicable, to waive any exclusions for preexisting conditions under any such
health or welfare plans.

or any other plan or arrangement covering the Company Group Employees, or (iii)&nbsp;limit the right of
Buyer to amend, terminate or otherwise modify, or to cause the Surviving Company Group to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify, any existing benefit plan or arrangement following the Closing Date.
Nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;6.8</U> shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person

therewith will be paid by such holder of Units or Phantom Units. Buyer will cause the Surviving
Company Group to maintain and preserve all Tax Returns, books, records and other documents that are
reasonably necessary for such cooperation for the lesser of (i)&nbsp;seven (7)&nbsp;years after the Closing
Date and (ii)&nbsp;any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended.

Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its respective Affiliates to execute and deliver
such further instruments, and take (or cause their respective Affiliates to take) such other
action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;6.11. <U>No Solicitation</U>. From the date hereof until the Closing Date or the

Representative will, and the Company shall cause each other member of the Company Group and any
officer, director, employee, representative, agent and advisor of any member of the Company Group

of business. Each of the Company and the Member Representative shall promptly notify Buyer of any
inquiry or proposal received by it or its representatives with respect to any such Acquisition
Transaction.

Closing Date, the Company may correct or supplement in writing any information furnished in the
Disclosure Schedule, including any information that is materially incorrect or incomplete as a
result of any facts or circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof, and shall promptly
furnish such supplemented information to Buyer. Thereafter, prior to the Closing, the Company
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any additional corrections or supplements to the
Disclosure Schedule. Any such corrected or supplemental information shall not be deemed to amend
this Agreement for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing condition set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;7.3(a)</U> or for purposes of determining whether any person is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>.

Parties</U>&#148;, and, together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the &#147;<U>Indemnified Parties</U>&#148;)
from and against all Damages as incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties or any of them arising
from or as a result of:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;subject to the limitations set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U>, the breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(ii)&nbsp;subject to the limitations set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U>, the breach or
non-performance by Buyer or Merger Sub of any of its covenants or other agreements contained
in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.3. <U>Indemnification Procedures</U>. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;If a claim for indemnification is to be made by an Indemnified Party with respect to any
claims asserted against it by an unaffiliated third-party (a &#147;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&#148;) that
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days following receipt of notice of
the Third-Party Claim) (i)&nbsp;notify the Party from whom indemnification is sought (which, in the case
of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units, shall be, on behalf of the holders of
Units and the holders of Phantom Units, the Member Representative) (such notified Party, the
&#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;) of the Third-Party Claim, and (ii)&nbsp;transmit to the Indemnifying Party
a written notice (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the basis of
the Indemnified Party&#146;s request for indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, and a
good-faith estimate of the amount of Damages attributable to such claim. Failure to provide such
Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Party&#146;s indemnification hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third-Party Claim, it being understood that such election shall be without prejudice to the right
of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim involves indemnifiable Damages under this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days after receipt of any Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party who is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, by all appropriate proceedings. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control
of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof, <I>provided </I>that the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the matter without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If an Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the Indemnified Party
that exceeds, where the Indemnified Party has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in
connection with the proposed compromise or settlement of a Third-Party Claim, the amount for which
that Third-Party Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement.
No Third-Party Claim that is being defended in good faith by the Indemnifying Party shall be
settled or compromised by the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding any dispute
as to liability under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall (in addition to, and
not in limitation of, its obligation to act in good faith), at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any
Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any
related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint
against any Person and making available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records, materials
and information in the Indemnified Party&#146;s possession or under its control (or in the possession or
control of any of its Affiliates or representatives) relating to the Third-Party Claim as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party or its counsel. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U>, and the Indemnified Party shall
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; <I>provided, however</I>, if in the
opinion of outside counsel of the Indemnified Party there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable
costs and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after receipt of any Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(b)</U>, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third-Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
<I>provided, however</I>, that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying
Party&#146;s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying
Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(c)</U>, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs
and expenses with respect to such participation. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to (or is
deemed to have elected not to) assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, or elects to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, but reserves the right to dispute whether such claim is an
indemnifiable Damage under this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, the determination of whether the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be resolved either by the Parties or in an
appropriate legal proceeding. Upon resolution of such dispute by the Parties or receipt of a final
and non-appealable order or determination from a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the
resolution of such dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the amount agreed in such
resolution or so ordered to be paid, if any.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;With respect to any indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide
written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any claim with respect to which the Indemnified Party
believes it is or may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U> hereof (an
&#147;<U>Indemnity Notice</U>&#148;). The Indemnity Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature
of the claim, the Indemnified Party&#146;s best estimate of the amount of Damages attributable to such
claim and the basis of the Indemnified Party&#146;s request for indemnification under this <U>Article
VIII</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
from its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim (the
&#147;<U>Dispute Notice</U>&#148;), the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with
such claim and shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to pay the
amount set forth in the Indemnity Notice promptly after the expiration of such 30-day period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for indemnification (including any
Third-Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot
resolve such dispute in thirty (30)&nbsp;days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, such dispute shall
be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of law in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Upon resolution of such dispute by the Parties or receipt of a final and non-appealable
order or determination from a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the resolution of such
dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the amount agreed in such resolution or so
ordered to be paid, if any.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;The term &#147;Damages&#148; as used in this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> is not limited to matters asserted
by third-parties against an Indemnified Party, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by an
Indemnified Party in the absence of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party&#146;s right to
indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> shall not be conditioned upon the payment of
amounts by such Indemnified Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.4. <U>Limitation on Liability</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, to the extent any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a)</U>, (a)&nbsp;such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to obtain such
indemnification solely out of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, (b)&nbsp;the aggregate
Liability of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for indemnification under <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a)</U> shall be limited to the then remaining balance of
the Escrow Amount, and (c)&nbsp;such Buyer Indemnified Party shall not have any recourse against the
Member Representative personally for indemnification pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a)</U> and (d)
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification to the extent such Damages
were included in the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.5. <U>Calculation of Damages</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;In calculating the amount of the Damages to any Indemnified Party under <U>Section
8.2</U>, the amount of Damages will be net of any amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party from
any third-party (including insurance proceeds) as a result of the facts or circumstances giving
rise to the Damages (such amounts, a &#147;<U>Reimbursement</U>&#148;). The Indemnified Parties shall
pursue payment under or from any insurer or third-party in respect of such Damages prior to
pursuing payment from any Indemnifying Party. If any Reimbursement is obtained subsequent to
payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Damages, then such Reimbursement shall be
promptly paid over to the Indemnifying Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Any payment made pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> shall be deemed
to be and treated, to the extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
all purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.6. <U>Exclusive Remedy</U>. Except for any equitable relief to which any Party may
be entitled and except in the case of fraud or as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.7</U>, from and after
the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and no Party shall pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer and Merger Sub each hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company Group) may have against the Company arising under or
based upon any Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.7. <U>Access</U>. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice by any Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives all reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party (including the members of the Company Group) related to the matters to which the
claim relates (<I>provided </I>that, as necessary to protect any attorney-client privilege, the
Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Party shall execute a joint defense agreement containing
customary terms). All such access shall be granted during normal business hours.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.8. <U>Mitigation of Damages</U>. The Parties shall cooperate with each other to
mitigate any Damages.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.9. <U>Certain Damages</U>. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS, IN NO EVENT
SHALL THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING UNDER THIS <U>ARTICLE
VIII</U>) OR THE TERM &#147;DAMAGES&#148; COVER OR INCLUDE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER BASED ON
STATUTE, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY&#146;S
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;8.10. <U>Release of Escrow Amount</U>. On the Survival Date the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Member Representative for distribution to the holders of Units (other than Preferred
Units) and the holders of Phantom Units (other than Preferred Phantom Units) all or any remaining
portion of the Escrow Amount (including any interest thereon), <I>less </I>(a)&nbsp;first, the amount of any
Member Allocable Expenses submitted to the Escrow Agent on or prior to such date and payable to the
Member Representative in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.2</U> and the Escrow Agreement, and then
<I>less </I>(b)&nbsp;second, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties which are properly asserted and pending on or prior to such date.
Promptly upon the resolution of a pending claim for indemnification related to clause&nbsp;(b) of this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.10</U>, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Member Representative for distribution
to holders of Units (other than Preferred Units) and the holders of Phantom Units (other than
Preferred Phantom Units) any Escrow Amount (including any interest thereon) retained in respect of
such pending claim for indemnification remaining after the resolution of such pending claim, <I>less</I>
the amount of any Member Allocable Expenses submitted to the Escrow Agent on or prior to such date
and payable to the Member Representative in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.2</U> and the Escrow
Agreement. Any distribution pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.10</U> shall be made to each holder of
Units (other than Preferred Units) and each holder of Phantom Units (other than Preferred Phantom
Units) <I>pro rata </I>in accordance with such holder&#146;s Applicable Percentage and shall otherwise be made
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>MEMBER REPRESENTATIVE</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;9.1. <U>Member Representative</U>. The Parties have agreed that it is desirable to
designate Satow Associates, LLC to act on behalf of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom
Units for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the &#147;<U>Member Representative</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;9.2. <U>Authority and Rights</U>. By the Members&#146; approval of this Agreement and
further each holder of Units and each holder of Phantom Units&#146; submission of a letter of
transmittal pursuant hereto, each of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time irrevocably ratifies the designation of Satow
Associates, LLC (or any successor representative) as Member Representative as provided in this
Agreement. The Member Representative shall have such powers and authority to take any and all
actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents for and on behalf of the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units,
as fully as such holders were acting on their own behalf, and take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of Member Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing;
<I>provided, however</I>, that the Member Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the
holders of Units or Phantom Units, except as expressly provided herein or therein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Member Representative shall have full power,
authority and discretion to estimate and determine the amounts of Member Allocable Expenses, and to
direct the Escrow Agent to pay such Member Allocable Expenses in accordance with <U>Sections
3.2</U> and <U>8.10</U> hereof. The Member Representative will at all times be entitled to rely
on any directions received from the holders of Units or Phantom Units; <I>provided, however, </I>that the
Member Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no
obligation to take any action in its capacity as Member Representative, unless the Member
Representative is entitled to funds under <U>Sections&nbsp;3.2</U> and <U>8.10</U> of this Agreement
and/or has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole discretion of
the Member Representative, are sufficient to protect the Member Representative against the costs,
expenses and Liabilities which may be incurred by the Member Representative in responding to such
direction or taking such action. The Member Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the
part of the Member Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Member Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Escrow Amount as set forth in <U>Sections&nbsp;3.2</U> and <U>8.10</U> of this Agreement and/or from
funds otherwise received by it in its capacity as Member Representative pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the
Member Representative in such capacity, and for indemnification against any loss, Liability or
expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member
Representative (except for those arising out of the Member Representative&#146;s gross negligence or
willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims for
indemnification. All actions taken by Member Representative under this Agreement, including but
not limited to, actions following the Closing Date with respect to all matters relating to
<U>Section&nbsp;3.2</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> hereof and to the Escrow Agreement, shall be binding
upon all holders of Units and all holders of Phantom Units and their successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent, and, after
the Closing Date, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to serve notice to, and deal
exclusively with, the Member Representative with respect to any and all matters concerning any of
the holders of Units or Phantom Units arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents (except as may otherwise expressly be set forth in such Transaction
Documents) or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any holder of Units, holder of Phantom Units or Indemnifying
Party by the Member Representative with respect thereto, and on any other action taken or purported
to be taken on behalf of any holder of Units, holder of Phantom Units or Indemnifying Party by the
Member Representative with respect thereto, as fully binding upon such holder of Units, holder of
Phantom Units or Indemnifying Party. If the Member Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to
exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the holders of
Units and the holders of Phantom Units, the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units
shall, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the occurrence of such event, appoint a successor representative
and, promptly thereafter, shall notify Buyer and the Escrow Agent of the identity of such
successor. Any such successor shall become the &#147;Member Representative&#148; for purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If for any reason there is no Member Representative
at any time, all references herein or in any other Transaction Document to the Member
Representative shall be deemed to refer to the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;9.3. <U>Limitations on Liability</U>. Except in cases of willful misconduct or fraud
and except as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.3(a)</U>, the Member Representative will have no Liability
to the holders of Units and the holders of Phantom Units or their successors or assigns with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member Representative and shall
be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement from the holders of Units and the holders of
Phantom Units (whether from the Escrow Amount or otherwise) against any loss, Liability, fees or
expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Member
Representative.

subsection (b)&nbsp;is not in default or breach of any Transaction Document to which it is party and
<I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (b)&nbsp;shall not

or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by each of the Parties. No waiver by
any of the Parties of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;All Exhibits, Schedules and the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any matter disclosed pursuant to any
Section&nbsp;of or Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;to this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (or any section of
any Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;to this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule) whose relevance or
applicability to any representation or warranty made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the
information called for by any other Section&nbsp;of or Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule (or any other section of any Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;to this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule) is reasonably apparent on its face shall be deemed to be an exception to such

and Exhibits&nbsp;to this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule (and all sections of all Schedules and
Exhibits&nbsp;to this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule), notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross-reference thereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the provisions of
this <U>Section&nbsp;11.5(a)</U> shall not apply to, or have any effect on, the representations and
warranties made in <U>Sections&nbsp;4.1</U> through <U>4.8</U> or any Section of or Schedule or
Exhibit to this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule (or any section of any Schedule or Exhibit to
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule) related thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty nor the
mere inclusion of any item in a Schedule or in the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall be deemed an admission by a Party that such item represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Group, Buyer
or Merger Sub.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.6. <U>Headings</U>. The table of contents and section headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement or
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.7. <U>Construction</U>. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.8. <U>No Other Representations or Warranties</U>. Except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of
the Company or any of its Affiliates nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty,
express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to the Company Group and its Affiliates, the
Units, the Phantom Units or any of the assets or Liabilities of the Company Group and its
Affiliates, or with respect to any other information provided to Buyer or Merger Sub, whether on
behalf of the Company Group or such other Persons, including as to the probable success or
profitability of the Company Group after the Closing. No holder of Units or Phantom Units or any
other Person will have or be subject to any Liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from
the distribution to Buyer or Merger Sub, or Buyer or Merger Sub&#146;s use of, any such information,
including any information, document or material made available to Buyer or Merger Sub in certain
&#147;data rooms,&#148; management presentations or in any other form in expectation or contemplation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.9. <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule and
the Exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements, discussions or representations among
the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the
subject matter hereof or thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.10. <U>Severability</U>. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be declared by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of
this Agreement, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such
determination that any provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal,
void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.11. <U>Expenses</U>. Unless otherwise provided herein, each Party agrees to pay,
without right of reimbursement from the other Parties, all costs and expenses incurred by it
incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the fees
and disbursements of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed by
it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.12. <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement and all claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law principles that would result in
the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.13. <U>Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (i)&nbsp;state courts
of the State of Delaware and (ii)&nbsp;the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for
the purposes of any suit, Action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any Action, suit or proceeding
relating hereto except in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered mail to such Party&#146;s
respective address set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;11.3</U> will be effective service of process for any
Action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (A)&nbsp;state
courts of the State of Delaware or (B)&nbsp;the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any Action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on
the judgment in any jurisdiction or in any other manner provided in law or in equity.<sup> </sup>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.14. <U>Equitable Remedies</U>. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereby agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an Injunction or Injunctions to
prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically
the performance by such first Party under this Agreement, and each Party hereby agrees to waive the
defense in any such suit that the other Party have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no
opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of Injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining
such relief. The equitable remedies described in this <U>Section&nbsp;11.14</U> shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the Parties may elect to
pursue. The Parties hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement required to be performed prior to the Closing are not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that, prior to the Closing, the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;11.15. <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute
one and the same instrument.
