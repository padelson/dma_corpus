ARTICLE I 

CONTRIBUTION; CONSIDERATION; CLOSING

At the Closing (as hereinafter defined), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the following transactions shall be
completed as set forth below. Section 1.1 _Contribution of Interests_ _._ ETE Sigma shall contribute,
assign and transfer the Interests to Heritage ETC (the " _Contribution_ ") in
exchange for cash and the issuance of the ETP Units as described in _Section
1.2_ hereof.

 

Section 1.2 _Distribution of Cash and Issuance of ETP Units_. As consideration
for the Contribution, ETP shall:

 

(a) pay to ETE an amount in cash equal to $1,400,000,000 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") by wire or interbank transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) specified by ETE; and

(b) issue (the " _Issuance_ ") to ETE 49,484,102 newly issued ETP Units (the
" _Acquired ETP Units_ ").

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing (as hereinafter
defined), the outstanding ETP Units shall have been changed into a different
number of units or a different class of units by reason of any equity
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
equity split, reverse equity split, combination or exchange of units, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the number of ETP Units to be issued
pursuant to clause (b) of this _Section 1.2_ shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

Section 1.3 _Distributions Relating to the Acquired ETP Units_.

(a) The Parties agree that if the Closing (as hereinafter defined) occurs
after the last day of the calendar quarter (the " _Preceding Quarter_ ")
immediately prior to the calendar quarter (the " _Closing Quarter_ ") in which
the Closing occurs but prior to the record date for the distribution in
respect of the Preceding Quarter, then at Closing, the Cash Consideration
shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of
Acquired ETP Units by (y) $0.89375 (unless prior to Closing, ETP shall have
declared its cash distribution in respect of the Preceding Quarter, in which
event such number in this clause (y) shall be the cash distribution amount
declared per ETP Unit) (such amount in clause (y) being referred to as the "
_Estimated Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount_ "), __plus__ (ii)
the amount of incentive distributions to which ETE would be entitled with
respect to the distributions made on the Acquired ETP Units based on the
Estimated Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount and _plus_ (iii) the
amount of distributions with respect to its Percentage Interest (as defined in
the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of ETP (as
amended to date, the " _ETP Partnership Agreement_ ")) as Energy Transfer
Partners GP, L.P. (" _ETP GP_ ") would be entitled with respect to the
distributions made on the Acquired ETP Units based on the Estimated
Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount (such aggregate amount in
clause (i) , (ii) and (iii) being referred to herein as the " _Estimated
Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount_ ").

 

(b) If the Closing occurs within the period specified in _Section 1.3(a)_,
unless the actual declared per unit distribution in respect of the Preceding
Quarter (the " _Actual Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount_ ") is
used to determine the Estimated Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution
Amount, then not later than the second business day following ETPÂ’s
declaration of its cash distribution in respect of the Preceding Quarter, ETP
shall prepare and deliver to ETE a calculation of the Actual Preceding Quarter
Distribution Amount (as defined below). Within two business days after such
delivery, (i) if the Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount exceeds the
Estimated Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount, then ETE shall wire transfer
in immediately available funds the amount of such excess 

 



2  to an account designated by ETP and (ii) if the Estimated Preceding Quarter
Distribution Amount exceeds the Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount,
then ETP shall wire transfer in immediately available funds the amount of
such excess to an account designated by ETE. For purposes of this _Section
1.3(b)_, the " _Actual Preceding Quarter Distribution Amount_ " means (x) the
product of (A) the number of Acquired ETP Units multiplied by (B) the Actual
Preceding Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount, __plus__ (y) the amount of
incentive distributions which ETE received with respect to the distributions
made on the Acquired ETP Units based on the Actual Preceding Quarter Per Unit
Distribution Amount, _plus_ (z) the amount of distributions with respect to
its Percentage Interest which ETP GP received with respect to the
distributions made on the Acquired ETP Units based on the Actual Preceding
Quarter Per Unit Distribution Amount.

Section 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Latham and
Watkins LLP, 811 Main Street, Suite 3700, Houston, Texas at such time, date
and place as agreed to in writing by the Parties after all of the conditions
set forth in _Article 4_ hereof (other than those conditions which by their
terms are only capable of being satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or due waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived
by the Party or Parties entitled to waive such conditions, unless another
time, date and place are agreed to in writing by the Parties.

different construction, be deemed to be references to the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement. All personal pronouns used in this Agreement,

cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
(a) the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (b) any state appellate court

Action shall be conclusive and binding on such Party and that such award or
judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either

invalid under, the laws of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the
subject matter hereof, such contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate
the entire Agreement. Instead, this Agreement shall be construed as if it did
not contain the particular provision or provisions held to be invalid and an
equitable adjustment shall be made and necessary provision added so as to give
effect, as nearly as possible, to the intention of the Parties as expressed
in this Agreement at the time of execution of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 2.1 _Shelf Registration_.

(a) _Shelf Registration_. As soon as practicable following the Closing of the
issuance to ETE of the Covered ETP Units pursuant to the terms of the
Contribution Agreement, but in any event within 90 days of the Closing, ETP
shall prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act to
permit the public resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time as
permitted by Rule 415 of the Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration
Statement_ "). ETP shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Shelf Registration Statement to become effective no later than 180 days after
the date of the Closing (the " _Shelf Registration_ "). The Shelf Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this  _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be on such
appropriate

 



1  registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by ETP; _provided_
, _however_ , that if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with
the marketing of an Underwritten Offering from the Shelf Registration
Statement and the Managing Underwriter at any time shall notify ETP in writing
that, in the sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed
information to be used in such prospectus supplement is of material
importance to the success of the Underwritten Offering of such Registrable
Securities, ETP shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include such
information in such a prospectus supplement. ETP will cause the
Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ to be
continuously effective under the Securities Act until all Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been distributed
in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration
Statement or there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ "). The Shelf Registration Statement when declared
effective (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will
comply as to form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading.

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, ETP may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, suspend such
Selling HolderÂ’s use of any prospectus which is a part of the Shelf
Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall discontinue
sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement) if ETP (i) is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization,
disposition or other similar transaction and determines in good faith that
its ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially
adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf
Registration Statement or (ii) has experienced some other material non-public
event the disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of ETP
would materially adversely affect ETP. Upon disclosure of such information or
the termination of the condition described above, ETP shall provide prompt
notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the
Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of
sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit
registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

Section 2.2  _Underwritten Offering_. In the event that a Selling Holder
elects to dispose of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering, ETP shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, which shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to the
effect and to the extent provided in _Section 2.7_, and shall take all such
other reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter in
order to expedite or facilitate the registration and disposition of the
Registrable Securities. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under
this Agreement, ETP shall be entitled to select the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters. No Selling Holder may participate in such Underwritten Offering
unless such Selling Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the
basis provided in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. Each
Selling Holder may, at its option, require that any or all of the
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
ETP to and for the benefit of such underwriters also be made to and

 



2  for such Selling HolderÂ’s benefit and that any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting
agreement also be conditions precedent to its obligations. No Selling Holder
shall be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements
with ETP or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Selling Holder and its ownership of the securities
being registered on its behalf and its intended method of distribution and any
other representation required by law. If any Selling Holder disapproves of the
terms of an underwriting, such Selling Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom
by notice to ETP and the Managing Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such withdrawal must be made up to and including the time of pricing of such
offering to be effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect
ETPÂ’s obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

Section 2.3 _Registration Procedures_. In connection with its
obligations contained in _Section 2.1_, ETP will, as expeditiously as
possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement;

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Shelf Registration Statement or any supplement
or amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of
all such documents proposed to be filed (including furnishing or making
available exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the
extent then required by the rules and regulations of the Commission), and
provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information
pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such
Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing the Shelf
Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies of the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus
included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement or other registration statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the
Selling Holders or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing
Underwriter, shall reasonably request, provided that ETP will not be required
to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where it is not
then required to so qualify or to take any action which would subject it to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;

 

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when
a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement or any
prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Shelf
Registration Statement, when the same has become effective, and (ii) any
written comments from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in
clause (i) and any written request by the Commission for amendments or
supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement thereto;

 



3 (e) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in the Shelf Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing, (ii) the issuance or threat of issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
or (iii) the receipt by ETP of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale
under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, ETP agrees to as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or
take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement
does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing and to take such other action as is necessary to remove a stop order,
suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

 

(f) furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters
or other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency
or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any
domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of
Registrable Securities;

 

(g) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request, (i) an
opinion of counsel for ETP, dated the effective date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement, and (ii) "comfort letters," dated the pricing date of
any underwritten offering and letters of like kind dated the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified ETPÂ’s and any other required
financial statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "comfort letters,"
shall be in customary form and covering substantially the same matters with
respect to such registration statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus
supplement included therein) and as are customarily covered in opinions
of issuerÂ’s counsel and in accountantsÂ’ comfort letters delivered to the
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities, and such other matters
as such underwriters may reasonably request;

 

(h) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months,
beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date of
such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of _Section 11(a)_ of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated
thereunder;

 



4 (i) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and ETP personnel
as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a due
diligence defense under the Securities Act; provided that ETP need not
disclose any information to any such representative unless and until such
representative has entered into a confidentiality agreement with ETP;

(j) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by ETP are then listed;

 

(k) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of ETP to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities;

 

(l) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement; and

(m) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as
are reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any,
in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from ETP of the happening of any
event of the kind described in subsection (e) of this _Section 2.3_, shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until such
Selling HolderÂ’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this _Section 2.3_ or until it
is advised in writing by ETP that the use of the prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated
by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by ETP, such Selling
Holder will, or will request the managing underwriter or underwriters, if
any, to deliver to ETP (at ETPÂ’s expense) all copies in their possession or
control, other than permanent file copies then in such Selling HolderÂ’s
possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at
the time of receipt of such notice.

Section 2.4 _Cooperation by Holders_. ETP shall have no obligation to include
in the Shelf Registration Statement Registrable Securities of a Holder who has
failed to timely furnish such information which, in the opinion of counsel to
ETP, is reasonably required in order for the Shelf Registration Statement or
any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto, as applicable, to comply
with the Securities Act.

Section 2.5  _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities who is included in the
Shelf Registration Statement agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution of the Registrable Securities during the 90 calendar day period
beginning on the date of a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission
with respect to the pricing of an Underwritten Offering, provided that (i) ETP
gives written notice to such Holder of the date of the commencement and
termination of such period with respect to any such Underwritten Offering and
(ii) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the
duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on
ETP or on the officers or directors or any other unitholder of ETP on whom a
restriction is imposed.

 



5 Section 2.6 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to ETPÂ’s performance under or compliance with this Agreement to
effect the registration of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration, and
the disposition of such securities, including, without limitation, all
registration, filing, securities exchange listing and NYSE fees, all
registration, filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying
with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., transfer taxes and fees of transfer agents and
registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, the fees
and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for ETP,
including the expenses of any special audits or "comfort letters" required by
or incident to such performance and compliance. Except as otherwise provided
in _Section 2.7_, ETP shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by
Holders in connection with the exercise of such HoldersÂ’ rights hereunder. In
addition, ETP shall not be responsible for any " _Selling Expenses_ ," which
means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions allocable to
the sale of the Registrable Securities.

 

(b) _Expenses_. ETP will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the
Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_ whether or
not the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or any sale is made
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. Each Selling Holder shall pay
all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable
Securities hereunder.

Section 2.7 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _By ETP_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, ETP will indemnify and
hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its directors and officers of
Registrable Securities thereunder and each Person, if any, who controls such
Selling Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) (collectively,
" _Losses_ "), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder or
underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement, any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and
will reimburse each such Selling Holder, its directors and officers, each
such underwriter and each such controlling Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Loss or actions or proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that ETP will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any
such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission 

 



6  or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder, such underwriter or such controlling Person in writing
specifically for use in the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereof. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder or any such director, officer or controlling
Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling
Holder.

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless ETP, its directors and officers, and
each Person, if any, who controls ETP within the meaning of the Securities Act
or of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from ETP
to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to information regarding such
Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder
expressly for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereof relating to the
Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of each
Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party other than under this  _Section
2.7_. In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and
undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this _Section 2.7_ for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the
defense and employ counsel or (ii) if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to
the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable
defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the interests
of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the
interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the
right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses
related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect to
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnifying party.

 



7 (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.7_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to ETP or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold them
harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses as between ETP
on the one hand and such Selling Holder on the other, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of ETP on the one hand and of such
Selling Holder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such Selling
Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar
amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder
from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.
The relative fault of ETP on the one hand and each Selling Holder on the other
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to,
information supplied by such party, and the partiesÂ’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by
_pro rata_ allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of
this paragraph. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the
Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to
include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss that is the
subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.7_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 

Section 2.8 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the benefits
of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale
of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, ETP agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) Make and keep public information regarding ETP available, as those terms
are understood and defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, at all times
from and after the date hereof;

 

(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of ETP under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at
all times from and after the date hereof; and

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to
such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of ETP, and such other reports and documents so filed as such
Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without
registration.

 



8 Section 2.9 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause ETP to register Registrable Securities granted to ETE by ETP under this
Article II may be transferred or assigned by ETE to one or more transferee(s)
or assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities, provided that (a) each such
transferee or assignee of such Registrable Securities receives at least
$5,000,000 of the Covered ETP Units, (b) ETP is given written notice prior to
any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of each such
transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which such
registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and (c) each such
transferee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the
obligations of ETE under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Information by Holder_. Any Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities included in any registration shall promptly furnish to ETP such
information regarding such Holder or Holders and the distribution proposed by
such Holder or Holders as ETP may reasonably request and as shall be required
in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to
herein.

issued in respect of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the Registrable
Securities, and shall be appropriately adjusted for combinations,
recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date of this Agreement.

 



9 Section 3.5 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of
this Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to
and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the
right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and
all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence
of the court to grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The
existence of this right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any
other rights and remedies at law or in equity which such Person may have. 

Section 3.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute
but one and the same Agreement.

 

Section 3.7 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

Section 3.8 _Governing Law_. The laws of the State of Delaware shall govern
this Agreement without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

Section 3.9 _Severability of Provisions_. Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

Section 3.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the parties as
a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions,
promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred
to herein with respect to the rights granted by ETP set forth herein. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 3.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by ETP and the Holders of a majority of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities; _provided, however,_ that no such
amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder
hereunder without the consent of such Holder.

Section 3.12 _No Presumption_. In the event any claim is made by a party
relating to any conflict, omission, or ambiguity in this Agreement, no
presumption or burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the
fact that this Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a particular
party or its counsel.
