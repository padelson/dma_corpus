Identification Number (&#147;TIN&#148;) on the enclosed Substitute Form W-9. If such Stockholder is an individual, the TIN is his or her Social Security number. For businesses and other entities, the number is the Employer Identification Number. If
the Company or the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN, the Stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;). In addition, the Stockholder Dividend or the Merger Consideration to
which the Stockholder is entitled with respect to Shares surrendered in connection with the Merger and any interest earnings on the Escrow Amount may be subject to backup withholding. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If backup withholding applies, the Company or the Exchange Agent may be required to withhold a portion of any cash payment made to the
Stockholder with respect to the Stockholder Dividend or Shares surrendered in connection with the Merger Agreement and any interest earnings on the Escrow Account. The backup withholding rate is currently 28% but is scheduled to be increased to 31%
beginning January&nbsp;1, 2013. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of backup withholding is treated as an advance payment of a tax liability, and a Stockholder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability will be reduced by
the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund from the IRS may be obtained by the Stockholder. Failure to comply truthfully with the backup withholding requirements may also result in the imposition of
severe criminal and/or civil fines and penalties. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Purpose of Substitute Form W-9 </I></FONT></P>

that the TIN provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that such Stockholder is awaiting a TIN). A Stockholder is also required to certify on Substitute Form W-9 that (i)&nbsp;the Stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, or (ii)&nbsp;the
Stockholder has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (iii)&nbsp;the IRS has notified the holder that the Stockholder is no longer subject to backup
withholding. In addition, the Stockholder must provide its name and address, check the appropriate box regarding its classification for federal tax purposes, and date and sign as indicated. </FONT></P>
