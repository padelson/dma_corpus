1.5 _Effect on Shares_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 1.5(d)_ and any applicable backup or other
withholding requirements, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Common
Stock (including each Restricted Share) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become the right to
receive (i) the amount of cash equal to the Common Stock Exchange Amount and
(ii) the amount of cash, if any, payable with respect to such Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.12_ and the Escrow Agreement. 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Common Stock_ " shall mean the Common Stock of the Company, $0.001 par
value per share.

(ii) " _Common Stock Exchange Amount_ " shall be equal to (A) the sum of the
Initial Merger Consideration plus (y) the aggregate exercise price of all
Company Options and all Company Warrants and (z) the amount of all repaid
promissory notes pursuant to _Section 5.11_, divided by (B) the aggregate

exercise of all Company Options and all Company Warrants, calculated in
accordance with _Schedule 1.5(b)(ii)_. 

(c) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from each Stockholders
respective portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
United States federal, state or local, or any foreign, Tax Law. Such amounts

(d) Any and all undeclared or unpaid dividends on the shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective
Time. Any shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
consideration of any kind shall be delivered in exchange therefor under this
Agreement.

 



4 1.6 _Stockholders  Rights upon Merger_.

 

(a) Upon consummation of the Merger, certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall cease to represent any rights with respect thereto,
other than, subject to applicable Law and this Agreement, the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable hereunder with
respect to such shares of Common Stock.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the
extent that appraisal rights are available under the DGCL, any shares of
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that have not been voted for adoption of this Agreement,
with respect to which appraisal rights have been properly and timely
perfected in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion, if any, of the
Merger Consideration payable hereunder with respect to such shares of Common
Stock at or after the Effective Time. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
effectively withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to
be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive, when and as payable, the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares of Common Stock
hereunder upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 1.5_ hereof. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demand received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Common Stock. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as
may otherwise be required under applicable Law, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

1.7 _Stock Options, Warrants, and Other Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Options_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, will, by virtue of
the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be an option to purchase shares of Common Stock and
be cancelled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such option at or
promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company Option an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of
the Common Stock Exchange Amount over the applicable exercise price of such
option by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock such holder could have
purchased (assuming full vesting of such Company Option) had such holder
exercised such Company Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time, as more fully set forth on _Schedule 1.7(a)_, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payments. Prior to paying such
holder its respective portion of the Merger Consideration, the Company shall
obtain from each holder of Company Options an option cancellation agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Option Cancellation
Agreements_ ").

 

(b) _Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of Common Stock that was acquired pursuant to any
equity or

 



5  compensation plan of the Company or other arrangement with the Company and
that is then unvested and subject to the Companys option or right to
repurchase such share (each, a " _Restricted Share_ "), shall vest and become
free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, at the Effective
Time, be converted into the right to receive, in cash, the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration (less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment), in accordance with _Sections 1.5(a)_
and _1.6_.

(c) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Warrant to acquire shares of
Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Company Warrants_ ") will, by virtue of the Merger and without the need
for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be a
warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock and be cancelled, and the Company
shall pay each holder of any such warrant at or promptly after the Effective
Time for each such Company Warrant an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Exchange
Amount over the applicable exercise price of such warrant by (ii) the number
of shares of Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder
exercised such Company Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time, as calculated on _Schedule 1.7(c)_, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payments.

(d) _Further Actions_. Subject to, and without limitation of, the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 1.7_, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate so that prior to or at the Effective Time, (i) all
options, warrants and other securities convertible into capital stock of
the Company and other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire capital stock
of the Company shall be canceled or terminated or expire by their terms, and
(ii) any plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be
terminated, _provided_ , that any such termination will comply with the
provisions of Code Section 409A, if applicable.

1.10 _Payment Mechanics for Shares_.

(a) Pursuant to an exchange agent agreement between Parent and the Exchange
Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), as of the Closing, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Common Stock, cash necessary to pay the Initial Merger
Consideration to such holders of shares of Common Stock to be paid in
connection with the Merger (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ," it being understood that any and all interest earned on
funds deposited therein pending payment shall be turned over to Parent). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments
provided for in this _Section 1.10_ and the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

(b) Parent will cause the Exchange Agent, within five Business Days after
the Closing Date, to deliver to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Common Stock at the address set forth opposite such holders name on _Schedule
1.10(b)_ (as updated from time to time in writing by the Company) a Letter of
Transmittal. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with the submission of a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, the holder of the shares of
Common Stock to which such Letter of Transmittal relates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor cash (without interest), representing such
holders respective portion of the Merger Consideration calculated in
accordance with, and payable when and as provided in, this Agreement, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments.
Following the Effective Time and pending a Stockholders submission of a
Letter of Transmittal, each such holder will be deemed, for all purposes, to
hold an irrevocable right to receive that amount of consideration equal to
his, her or its respective portion of the Merger Consideration into which such
holders shares of Common Stock shall have been so converted in accordance
with this Agreement.

 



8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may provide to certain holders of
shares of Common Stock the Letter of Transmittal and other documentation
described above prior to the Effective Time, and any such holder that
surrenders a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent, at or prior to Closing shall be entitled to receive,
and the Exchange Agent shall pay promptly after the Effective Time, cash
(without interest), representing such holders respective portion of the
Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable when and as
provided in, this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payments.

(c) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, no later than five
Business Days after submission of a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal by a Stockholder, cash (without interest), representing
such holders respective portion of the Initial Merger Consideration
calculated and payable in accordance with this Agreement.

(d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by a holder of
shares of Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent and any such holder who has not returned a Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with this _Section 1.10_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of such holders portion of the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Representative or any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Common Stock two
years after the Effective Time (or, in either case, such earlier date
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Government) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.11 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

(a) " _Net Working Capital_ " means, as of 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time,
on the Closing Date, the excess of the Current Assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis over the Current Liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as reflected on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of such
date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Current Assets_ " shall mean cash,
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other receivables and
inventory reflected on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries but
shall specifically exclude any deferred Tax assets and Tax Assets of the

 



9  Company or its Subsidiaries and any promissory notes to be repaid pursuant
to _Section 5.11_. For the purpose of computing Net Working Capital, accounts
receivable shall exclude any outstanding invoices that relate to customer
orders originally booked on or after April 20, 2012 and that include product
or services that are not available to be delivered on the Closing Date. Such
orders would include, but are not limited to, customer orders that implicitly
or explicitly include (i) the promise of delivery of products or features that
have not been developed or are not generally available for sale to all
customers, (ii) the exchange of currently available product for newer product
at some point in the future, (iii) professional services that require in
excess of 80 hours of effort, and (iv) extended maintenance services that
cover periods greater than 12 months from the Closing Date. " _Current
Liabilities_ " shall mean accounts payable, accrued compensation and benefits,
other accrued expenses and deferred rent reflected on the books of the Company
and its Subsidiaries but shall specifically exclude any deferred Tax
liabilities and Tax Liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries and the
Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and Option Replacement Payments of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) _Net Taxes Payable_. " _Net Taxes Payable_ " means, with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the portion of any Straddle Period that ends at
11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date, the amount by which
(i) the unpaid accrued Taxes of the Company (excluding (A) Taxes attributable
to actions taken by the Buyer or the Surviving Company on the Closing Date
after the Effective Time outside of the Ordinary Course of Business that are
not contemplated by this Agreement and (B) Taxes attributable to the items set
forth on _Schedule 8.6(h)_) (" _Tax Liabilities_ " ), exceeds (ii) any
refunds for Taxes attributable to Tax Returns filed on or before the Closing
Date and any Tax deposits (excluding any estimated U.S. federal income Tax
payments) actually available under applicable Law (" _Tax Assets_ "). All Tax
Assets and Tax Liabilities will be as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet
but as of 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, except that: (x) the amount of U.S.
federal income Tax Liability for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined after giving effect to up to Four Million Eight Hundred
Fifty One Thousand Two Hundred Sixty Seven Dollars ($4,851,267) available
Pre-Closing Transaction Tax Deductions; (y) the amount of any U.S. federal
income Tax Liability for the taxable periods ending on or before December 31,
2011 shall be determined without giving effect to any carryback of any net
operating loss attributable to the Pre-Closing Transaction Tax Deductions; and
(z) the amount of any other Tax Liability with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date
shall be determined after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Transaction Tax
Deductions.

(c) _Pre-Closing Estimates_. At least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth the
calculation of an estimate as of 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the
Closing Date of (i) the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_
"), (iii) the Net Taxes Payable (the " _Estimated Net Taxes Payable_ ") and
(iv) the Company Transaction Expenses (such statement being, the " _Good Faith
Statement_ "). The Good Faith Statement shall be prepared by the Company in
good faith, in a reasonable manner, and in accordance with the accounting

 



10  principles set forth on _Schedule 1.11(c)_, consistently applied. Parent
shall have reasonable access to copies of the working papers of the Company
prepared or used in connection with the Companys preparation of the Good
Faith Statement. Parent shall have an opportunity to review with
representatives of the Company and object to all or any part of the Good Faith
Statement, such review to be reasonably prompt and any objection to be
reasonable and made in good faith. If the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) (the "
_Target Net Working Capital_ " ), then the Initial Merger Consideration
payable at the Closing pursuant to _Sections 1.4_ and _1.9(b)_ shall be
increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the amount of such increase exceed Twelve
Million Dollars ($12,000,000) (the " _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
Amount_ "). If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital, then the Initial Merger Consideration payable at
the Closing pursuant to _Sections 1.4_ and _1.9(b)_ shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. The Initial Merger Consideration
payable at the Closing pursuant to _Sections 1.4_ and _1.9(b)_ shall also be
reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated Indebtedness, if any.
In addition, if the Estimated Net Taxes Payable is greater than Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the " _Target Net Taxes Payable_ " ), then
the Initial Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to 
_Sections 1.4_ and _1.9(b)_ shall also be reduced by an amount equal to the
amount by which the Estimated Net Taxes Payable exceeds the Target Net Taxes
Payable (the " _Estimated Excess Net Taxes Payable_ " ). If the Estimated Net
Taxes Payable is equal to or less than the Target Net Taxes Payable, no
adjustment will be made to the Initial Merger Consideration for Estimated Net
Taxes Payable.

 

(d) _Delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement of
Indebtedness_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date,
and in any event within 90 calendar days thereafter, Parent shall deliver to
the Representative, (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ " ), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared by Parent as of 11:59 p.m.,
Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date determined using the Closing
Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (iii) a calculation of
Net Taxes Payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared by Parent as of
11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date determined using the
Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net Taxes Payable_ "), and (iv) a
statement reflecting the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of Indebtedness_
") using the methodology set forth on _Schedule 1.11(c)_. The total amount of
Indebtedness on the Closing Statement of Indebtedness shall be the " _Closing
Indebtedness_." For purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, take, within a reasonable period of time following the
Closing, a physical count of the inventory of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries. Designees of the Representative may observe the taking of such
physical count. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), as in
effect at

 



11  the date of the financial statement to which it refers, using and applying
(to the extent applicable and not inconsistent with GAAP) the same accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent
classifications, judgments, elections, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Company in the
preparation of the latest Annual Financial Statements (as hereinafter
defined) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, where applicable, using the
methodology described on _Schedule 1.11(c)_. To the extent there is any
inconsistency between the methodology of GAAP applied in a manner
consistent with the accounting principles applied in the preparation of the
Annual Financial Statements and the methodology described on _Schedule
1.11(c)_, the methodology described on _Schedule 1.11(c)_ shall supersede and
be the basis on which the Closing Balance Sheet is prepared.

(e) _Audit Rights; Agreement upon the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Net Taxes Payable and Closing Indebtedness_. Upon delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement of Indebtedness, Parent shall provide
the Representative and its accountants reasonable access to the accountants
and accounting records of the Company and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Representative with reasonable access to any
and all working papers prepared by the Company or Parent related to the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement of
Indebtedness, and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Net
Taxes Payable and Closing Indebtedness. If the Representative disagrees with
the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
and Closing Net Taxes Payable as not being in accordance with GAAP, as in
effect at the date of the financial statement to which it refers, using and
applying (to the extent applicable and not inconsistent with GAAP) the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with
consistent classifications, judgments, elections, inclusions, exclusions and
valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Company in the
preparation of the latest Annual Financial Statements and/or, as applicable,
_Schedule 1.11(c)_, or the Closing Statement of Indebtedness or the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness as not being in accordance with the
principles set forth on  _Schedule 1.11(c)_, or, in either case, as having
computational or other errors, the Representative must notify Parent of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement, within 30 days after its receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net Taxes
Payable or the Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the calculation of
Closing Indebtedness, as the case may be. In the event that the
Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such
30-day period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and
Closing Net Taxes Payable as set forth therein and/or the Closing Statement
of Indebtedness and the calculation of Closing Indebtedness as set forth
therein, each as delivered by Parent, which, in either or both cases, if not
objected to within the relevant 30-day period, shall then be final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect
to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital and/or Closing Net Taxes Payable or the Closing
Statement of Indebtedness and/or calculation of Closing Indebtedness, as the
case may be. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then Parent and the Representative shall mutually select an
independent accounting firm of

 



12  recognized national standing (the " _Auditor_ ") to act as a referee to
resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within 30 calendar days after the date on
which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on the terms of
this Agreement, any remaining disputes. The Representative (or its designee)
shall be permitted to submit a proposed Closing Balance Sheet or Closing
Statement of Indebtedness, as the case may be, and Parent shall submit the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement of Indebtedness initially sent to
the Representative pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_ (as it may have been
modified as a result of discussions between Parent and the Representative so
long as such modifications are not adverse to the Securityholders), and, in
each case, applicable supporting documentation and to make a presentation to
the Auditor in connection with the resolution of any such disagreements, and,
without the mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative, the Auditor
shall not rely on or consider any other documents, materials, presentations or
evidence (other than the plain language of the Agreement) in making its
determination. To the extent that a value has been assigned to any
disagreement that remains in dispute, the Auditor shall not assign a value to
such objection that is greater than the greatest value for such objection
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such objection
claimed by either Party. It is the intent of the Parties that the process set
forth in this _Section 1.11(e)_ and the activities of the Auditor in
connection herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as)
an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal
arbitration rules should be followed (including, in particular, but
without limitation, rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The fees
and expenses of the Auditor incurred in connection with its review and
resolution of any disputes shall be allocated between Parent, on one hand, and
the Escrow Amount, on the other, by the Auditor in proportion to the extent
either of such Parties did not prevail in the aggregate on items in dispute on
their respective Closing Balance Sheets or Closing Statements of Indebtedness,
as the case may be; _provided_ , that such fees and expenses shall not
include, so long as a Party complies with the procedures of this Section, the
other Partys outside counsel, accounting or other fees. The determination of
the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Net Taxes Payable and
Closing Indebtedness as finally determined in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 1.11_ shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Net Working
Capital_ ," " _Final Closing Net Taxes Payable_ " and " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_ ," respectively. The date on which the Final Closing Net Working
Capital, Final Closing Net Taxes Payable and Final Closing Indebtedness are
all finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.11(e)_ (or the
latest date on which any of such calculations is finally determined) is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_." 

(f) _Definitions_. The following terms shall have the following meanings:

 

(i) " _Final Excess Net Taxes Payable_ " means, if the Final Closing Net Taxes
Payable is greater than the Target Net Taxes Payable, the amount by which the
Final Closing Net Taxes Payable exceeds the Target Net Taxes Payable.

 



13 (ii) " _Indebtedness Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (B) the Estimated
Indebtedness, each expressed as a negative number.

(iii) " _Net Taxes Payable Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Excess Net Taxes Payable, _minus_ (B) the
Estimated Excess Net Taxes Payable, each expressed as a negative number.

(iv) " _Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Closing Net Working Capital, _minus_ (B) the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. In the event that the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount plus the Working Capital Adjustment Amount exceeds
Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000), the Working Capital Adjustment Amount
shall be reduced by the amount of such excess.

For purposes of convenience only, the Parties agree that upon the final
determination of the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, the Net Taxes Payable
Adjustment Amount and the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, such amounts
shall be aggregated for the purpose of paying the Adjustment Amount (as
defined below) to Parent or the Representative, as the case may be. The sum of
the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, the Net Taxes Payable Adjustment
Amount and the Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be the " _Adjustment
Amount_." For example, if the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount equals negative
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (i.e., such amount is owed to Parent), the
Net Taxes Payable Adjustment Amount equals negative Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($200,000) (i.e., such amount is owed to Parent) and the Working
Capital Adjustment Amount equals positive One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) (i.e., such amount is owed to the Securityholders), each as
finally determined, then the Adjustment Amount would be negative One Million
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) and such amount would be owed and
payable to Parent in accordance with the terms of this  _Section 1.10_.

(g) _Positive Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five Business Days of the Determination Date, Parent shall deposit (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) in such bank account(s) as may
be designated by the Representative, the Adjustment Amount for distribution
to the Stockholders (other than any Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares),
the holders of Company Options and the holders of Company Warrants
(collectively, the " _Securityholders_ "), without interest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount
plus the Working Capital Adjustment Amount exceed Twelve Million Dollars
($12,000,000). Promptly following deposit by Parent, and subject to _Section
1.16(d)_, the Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder its
Percentage of any positive Adjustment Amount.

 

(h) _Negative Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five Business Days of the Determination Date, the Parties shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) to
Parent out of the Escrow Amount an amount equal to 

 



14  the lesser of (i) the Adjustment Amount, together with any interest earned
on that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Adjustment Amount or (ii)
the full amount of the Escrow Amount, together with any interest earned
thereon.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indebtedness_ " shall mean, without
duplication (i) all indebtedness for borrowed money; (ii) that portion of
obligations with respect to capital leases that is properly classified as a
liability on a balance sheet in conformity with GAAP (as
hereinafter defined); (iii) notes payable and drafts accepted representing
extensions of credit whether or not representing obligations for borrowed
money (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any trade accounts payable and
checks payable to the Company or a Subsidiary, which have been endorsed by
the Company or a Subsidiary for collection in the Ordinary Course of
Business); (iv) guaranties securing indebtedness for borrowed money; (v) all
amounts drawn under outstanding letters of credit; (vi) all deferred
compensation obligations, including (A) all payment obligations under the
Companys non-qualified deferred compensation plans (the " _Non-Qualified
Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") and (B) any underfunded pension, termination
indemnity, seniority premium, or post-retirement liabilities of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as required to be measured under SFAS 87 or SFAS 106 at
the transaction date (the " _Underfunded Liabilities_ "); and(vii) all
interest, any premiums payable or any other costs or charges (including any
prepayment penalties) on any instruments or obligations described in _clauses
(i)_ through  _(vi)_ hereof, all as the same may be payable upon the
complete and final payoff thereof simultaneous with or promptly following the
Closing.

1.12 _Escrow_.

(a) _Escrow Account_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay (or cause to be
paid), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Escrow Amount to
the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow to satisfy, at least in part, any
claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any post-closing adjustment pursuant
to _Section 1.11_; (ii) any Parent Indemnified Person for any indemnification
claim of any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 8.2_; or (iii)
any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Escrow Account_ "). The
Escrow Agent shall hold and invest the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Parties agree for all Tax purposes that:
(i) the right of the Securityholders to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as
deferred purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under Section
453 of the Code and any corresponding provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. law, as appropriate; (ii) interest may be imputed on such amount, as
required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; and (iii) Parent shall be treated
as the owner of the Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings earned from
the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or portion thereof,
shall be allocable to Parent pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and
Proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-8.

 

(b) _The Representative_. Upon any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2_, the Representative shall serve as the designated
representative of the Securityholders for purposes of receiving notices,
contesting claims, and authorizing payments for such claims. If the
Securityholders become obligated (whether through mutual agreement between
Parent and the Representative or as a result of a final non-appealable
judicial determination or otherwise

 



15  finally determined pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement) to provide an adjustment, indemnification or another payment
pursuant to or in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the
Representative shall, if necessary for the release of funds from the Escrow
Account, promptly execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse the appropriate amount from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.\\\

(c) _Representative Holdback._ At Closing, Parent shall withhold Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars $(500,000) (the " _Representative Holdback_ ") from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and shall
pay the Representative Holdback to an account designated by the
Representative. The Representative Holdback shall be held, used and disbursed
by or at the direction of the Representative for the purpose of paying fees
and satisfying expenses of the Representative incurred in connection with
the discharge of its duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including the costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in defending
against any claim or liability in performing his duties on behalf of the
Securityholders. The Representative shall have the right to recover all costs
and expenses incurred hereunder from the Representative Holdback as such costs
and expenses arise. If any of the Representative Holdback remains after the
Representative has discharged its duties under this Agreement, the
Representative shall pay to each Securityholder an amount equal to such
Securityholders Percentage of such excess. Any portion of the Representative
Holdback disbursed by the Representative to the Securityholders shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

(d) _Remaining Balance in Escrow Account_. On December 31, 2012, Parent and
the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) to the account(s) designated by the Representative, any amounts in the
Escrow Account in excess of the amount equal to (i) Nine Million Three Hundred
Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Four Dollars ($9,333,334) (the "
_Remaining Escrow Amount_ ") plus (ii) any interest earned on the Remaining
Escrow Amount, for distribution to the Securityholders in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the extent
all or a portion of such excess amount has been claimed by Parent to be owed
to a Parent Indemnified Person, such claimed amount shall not be paid by the
Escrow Agent on such date. Upon the expiration of the 18-month period
following the Closing Date, Parent and the Representative shall cause the
Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) any remaining amounts in
the Escrow Account (which have not then been claimed by Parent to be owed to
a Parent Indemnified Person), together with any interest earned on any such
amount, to the account(s) designated by the Representative. Promptly following
receipt thereof, but subject to _Section 1.16(d)_, the Representative shall
distribute to each Securityholder its Percentage of any Remaining Escrow
Amount.

(e) _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. Except for any interest amount(s) paid
thereon, any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 1.12_ shall be deemed to be and treated for all purposes as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

 



16 1.13 _Company Transaction Expenses_.

 

(a) _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_. At least two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent an estimate (which
estimate shall include such reserves as the Company determines in good faith
to be appropriate for any expenses that are not then known or determinable) on
_Schedule 1.13(a)_ of the Company Transaction Expenses (segregated by payee,
to the extent reasonably known or anticipated), that have been incurred (but
not yet paid) prior to Closing and that may be incurred at or after the
Closing (" _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Transaction Expenses_ " means all expenses incurred or
to be incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or, to the extent that the
Company or its Subsidiaries may be liable therefore, the Stockholders and the
Representative on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and/or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger), including, but not
limited to, all accounting, legal, investment banking and commercial banking
fees and expenses related thereto. Set forth on _Schedule 1.13(a)_ is a good
faith estimate as of the date of this Agreement of all Company Transaction
Expenses.

(b) _Payment of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_. On the Closing Date,
Parent shall pay (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) (i) to
Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., the amount indicated in the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses as payable to Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.; (ii) to MHT
Partners, L.P. the amount indicated in the Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses as payable to MHT Partners, L.P.; (iii) to Phillips and Reiter, PLLC
the amount indicated in the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses as payable
to Phillips and Reiter, PLLC; (iv) to Grant Thornton LLP the amount indicated in
the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses as payable to Grant Thornton LLP
and (v) to the Representative or its designee, an aggregate amount of cash
equal to the aggregate amount of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses,
_less_ any amounts paid under _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ above, which the
Representative shall use to promptly pay (and in any event within five
Business Days) the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, other than, or in
addition to, those referenced in _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ above. After
payment of the Company Transaction Expenses has been completed, the
Representative shall distribute to the Securityholders (other than any
Securityholder who holds Dissenting Shares), any remaining cash less any
amount of such remaining cash that would be payable with respect to Dissenting
Shares if such Shares had not been Dissenting Shares with such amount being
paid to Parent.

(c) _Option Replacement Payments_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) to each employee eligible for a
payment in lieu of Options upon the completion of the Transaction (" _Option
Replacement Payments_ ") the amount specified in _Schedule 1.13_, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Payments;
_provided_ , that the Option Replacement Payments for all of the eligible
employees shall not exceed the aggregate amount of Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000).

1.14 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_. The Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company
shall be as set forth in Exhibits D and E, respectively (the "Surviving
Company Organizational Documents").

 



17 1.15 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_.

 

(a) The directors and officers set forth on _Schedule 1.15_ shall be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Company, effective as of the
Effective Time, until their successors shall have been duly elected and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to) honor the obligations of the Company under any and all indemnification
agreements between the Company and any of its current directors and officers
that were in effect on the date hereof, copies of which are attached hereto as
_Schedule 1.15(b)_ (each, an " _Company Indemnified Person_ " and
collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Persons_ ").

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) cause the Surviving Company
Organizational Documents to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts
and omissions of the Company Indemnified Persons, in each case in their
capacities as officers or directors of the Company, occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, which provisions are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained
in the Company Organizational Documents as of the date hereof, and, during
such six-year period, except as required by applicable Law, such provisions
shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects the rights of the Company Indemnified Persons thereunder.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have purchased a six-year tail policy
or policies (the " _Tail Policy_ ") for its officers and directors
liability insurance on terms consistent with those in effect for the Company
immediately prior to the date hereof. Parent shall pay 50% of the cost of such
Tail Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parents portion
of such cost exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000). Following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain such policy in full
force and effect throughout the term of such policy (with no obligation to
extend the policy beyond its six-year term) and to continue to honor its
obligations thereunder. Except as expressly provided in _Section 1.15(b)_ and
_(c)_ , for each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company, the Tail Policy, together with any other policy of
directors and officers liability insurance held by the Company and in effect
prior to the Effective Time under which coverage is available, shall be the
sole source of indemnification by the Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Company.

1.16 _Securityholders  Representative; Actions_.

(a) Alexander Pepe has been appointed as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact
of the Securityholders for all matters in connection with this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement (the " _Representative_ ") pursuant to and by virtue of
the requisite approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Securityholders. The Representative will act on behalf of the Securityholders
with respect to all matters requiring action by the

 



18  Securityholders under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The
Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The Representative may resign
or such agency may be changed by the Securityholders from time to time upon
not less than 10 days prior written notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Representative may not be removed by the Securityholders unless
holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) plus the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Company Options and all
Company Warrants, calculated in accordance with _Schedule 1.5(b)(ii)_, agree
to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Representative may be filled
by the holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) plus the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Company Options and
all Company Warrants, calculated in accordance with _Schedule 1.5(b)(ii)_. If
for any reason there is no Representative at any time, all references herein
to the Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Securityholders. No
bond shall be required of the Representative and the Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services other than pursuant to the terms of
the Representative Agreement.

 

(b) The Representative shall take all actions required to be taken by the
Securityholders under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and may take any
action contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. By giving
notice to the Representative in the manner provided by _Section 10.1_, Parent
shall be deemed to have given notice to all Securityholders. Any action taken
by the Representative may be considered by Parent to be the action of the
Securityholder(s) for whom such action was taken for all purposes of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that Parent gives notice to the Representative of a claim for
which indemnification may be sought, the Representative shall have the
authority to determine, in his or her sole judgment, whether to retain counsel
(and to select that counsel) to protect the Securityholders interests,
subject to _Section 8.5_, whether to consent to indemnification and to make
all other decisions required to be made by the Securityholders pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, whether
to consent or withhold his or her consent to any settlement or compromise of a
claim. 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to the Securityholders for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Representative without gross negligence or bad
faith. The Securityholders shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Representative and hold the Representative harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on
the part of the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Representatives duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
the Representative (" _Representative Expenses_ "). The Representative shall
have the right to recover Representative Expenses, or to set aside a reserve
fund for Representative Expenses reasonably likely to be incurred from any
positive Adjustment Amount or any amount to be distributed to the
Securityholders from the Escrow Account; _provided_ , _however_ , that while
this _Section 1.16(d)_ allows the Representative to be paid from any
Adjustment Amount and any amount to be 

 



19  distributed to the Securityholders from the Escrow Account, this does not
relieve the Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Expenses, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10.10_ and  _10.12_ , shall
constitute a decision of the Securityholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Securityholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders. The
Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative.

(e) The Representative agrees that within a commercially reasonable time after
receipt of notice of a claim, he or she shall give each Securityholder notice
of the same and shall from time to time keep the Securityholders apprised as
to developments with respect to such claim. Such notices shall be sent to the
Securityholders at their respective addresses as may be communicated to the
Representative in writing by the Securityholders.

"prohibited transactions" (as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section
4975) and no violations of ERISA Section 407 for which an applicable statutory
or administrative exemption does not exist have occurred. Any employee
training and participant or other notices required by ERISA, HIPAA, COBRA,
the Code or any other state or federal law or any ruling or regulation of any
state or federal administrative agency with respect to each Plan have been
appropriately and timely given. No events have occurred with respect to

breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to the administration of any
Plan or ERISA Plan or the trust or other funding media relating thereto.

instrument is legal, valid and binding and in full force and effect, and

action, proceeding or investigation, suit, grievance, arbitration or other

legal action, proceeding or investigation, suit, grievance, arbitration or

its being a member of a controlled group with a person who has liability
under the Code or ERISA.

(m) All expenses and liabilities relating to all of the Plans described on
_Schedule 2.24_ have been, and will be on the Closing Date, fully and
properly accrued on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Financial Statements reflect all of such liabilities in a
manner satisfying the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board

for which information is available, and the statements of change in fund
balances, financial position and net assets available for benefits under the

Company and furnished to Parent, fairly represent the financial condition of
such Plans as of such date and the results of operations thereof for the year

since the last written report of actuaries on such Plans, which written
reports have been furnished to Parent.

the Company and its Subsidiaries) may be unilaterally amended, varied,
modified or terminated in whole or in part by the Company, its Subsidiaries or

2009, properly documented in writing in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and has, since January 1, 2009, been
operated in compliance with such provisions in effect from time to time since
such date. No employee or former employee of the Company is subject to any tax
or penalty under Code Section 409A due to a documentary or operational
failure thereunder.

(p) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.24(p)_, the consummation of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, other than by reason of
actions taken by Parent following the Closing, will not (i) entitle any
current or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation due to any
current or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as

incurred in connection with such claim. The aggregate loss and expense

Agreement; or (viii) the failure of the Company to meet any projections or
forecasts (it being understood that the underlying cause of, and the
facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise or contributing to, such
failure may be deemed to constitute a "Company Material Adverse Effect"
(unless otherwise excluded by this definition) and may be taken into account
in determining whether there has been, is or would be a Company Material
Adverse Effect);

(b) any fact, condition, change or event that causes or constitutes a breach
of any of the representations or warranties of the Company hereunder made as
of the date hereof;

(c) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby;

(d) any notice or other communication from or to any Government in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby;

 



63 (e) any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced threatened

The Company hereby acknowledges that Parent does not and shall not waive any
right it may have hereunder as a result of such notifications and any
notification given pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ (including any supplement
to the Schedules to this Agreement) shall (i) not have any effect for purposes

between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company
shall afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent all other information concerning the Companys and its

the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing

any action that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client or similar privilege held by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to third
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall make a good faith
effort to accommodate any request from Parent for access or information
pursuant to this Section in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or
violation, and (b) Parent shall not have access to personnel records of the
Company relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information that in the Companys good faith opinion is
sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Company to risk of
liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall make a good faith
effort to accommodate any request from Parent for access or information
pursuant to this Section in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or
violation. In addition, Parent shall not contact any personnel of the Company
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the express
prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. All
information provided pursuant to this Agreement shall remain subject in all
respects to the Confidentiality Agreement.

of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the Stockholders shall be a breach

information. During the term of this Agreement, none of the Company, any of

advisor of nationally recognized

 



67  reputation and outside legal counsel) will lead to a Superior Proposal,(ii)
thereafter furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information relating to the

following receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement,

Parent after taking such action of the status and terms of any discussions and
negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify

(including any changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed,
on a current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto) and shall

and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (a)

financial point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by

and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected

arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or the
Surviving Company in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for
all periods of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time and with the Surviving

(c) provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the

Agreement shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Securityholders when
due, regardless of whether such Taxes are technically owed by the Company,
Surviving Company, Parent, or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes, fees and charges, and if required by applicable Law, Parent will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company for any Tax year or period ending on or
before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") that are filed after
the Closing Date. Parent shall provide Representative with a copy of all
Income Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Pre-
Closing Period Income Tax Returns_ ") no later than 30 days prior to the due
date of each such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return. The Representative
shall be entitled to propose revisions to any Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Return, so long as any proposed revisions are provided to Parent no later than
10 days after the date on which the Representative received a copy of such
Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return from Parent. Parent will accept any
revisions proposed by the Representative to a Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Return unless filing such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return with such
proposed revisions is reasonably likely to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to penalties. All Taxes payable with respect to the Tax Returns
to be filed pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall be borne by the
Securityholders and paid to Parent no later than five Business Days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns, but only to the extent such Taxes
constitute Pre-Closing Taxes in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_.

(c) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company, the Surviving Company and their

Representative with a copy of all Income Tax Returns of the Company for any
Straddle Period (" _Straddle Period Income Tax Returns_ ") no later than 30
days prior to the due date of each such Straddle Period Income Tax Return.
The Representative shall be entitled to propose revisions to any Straddle
Period Income Tax Return, so long as any proposed revisions are provided to
Parent no later than 10 days after the date on which the Representative
received a copy of such Straddle Period Income Tax Return from Parent. Parent
will accept any revisions proposed by the Representative to a Straddle Period
Income Tax Return unless filing such Straddle Period Income Tax Return
with such proposed revisions is reasonably likely to subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to penalties. All Taxes payable with respect to the
Tax Returns to be filed pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c)_ shall be borne by
the Securityholders and paid to Parent no later than five Business Days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, but only to the extent such Taxes
constitute Pre-Closing Taxes in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_. For the
purposes of this _Sections 7.7(c)_ and _8.2(a)(vi)_ , in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending at 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date shall
(i) in the case of any Taxes other than any Income Tax, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax

 



76  for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Tax period ending at 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight
Time, on the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Income Tax, be deemed to
be equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended
at 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing Date, excluding any
Taxes attributable to actions taken by the Buyer on the Closing Date after the
Effective Time outside of the Ordinary Course of Business that are not
contemplated by this Agreement. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the allocations described in this _Section 7.7(c)_ shall be made in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company or the appropriate
Subsidiary of the Company, except for changes required by Law or fact.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that such prior
practices are in accordance with applicable Law.

 

(d) The Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such information
(including reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and Tax
filings) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax
Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The Representative
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
_Section 7.7_. Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding shall be deemed to be a
Third-Person Claim subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 8.5_ of
this Agreement.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto intend that, in conformance
with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(ii), any Income Tax deductions
recognized on the Closing Date that are attributable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including Tax deductions arising out of
payments made to holders of Company Options, Company Warrants, and Restricted
Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7_ and payments of Company Transaction Expenses
and Option Replacement Payments (" _Pre-Closing Transaction Deductions_ " )
shall be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

(f) Unless required by applicable Law or except as set forth below, no
amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
shall be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if
such amendment would materially increase the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes
borne by Securityholders pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(vi)_, without the
consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Representative acknowledges that Parent intends to amend the Tax Returns of
the Company in order to carryback net operating losses generated as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and hereby consents to
the amendment of such Tax Returns for such purpose.

ARTICLE 8

8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the Parties made herein shall survive the
Closing and continue in effect

 



77  through and including the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, except
that the representations and warranties of the Company under _Section 2.3_
(Capitalization and Related Matters), _Section 2.8_ (Taxes), and _Section
2.24_ (Employee Benefit Matters) and the representations and warranties of the
Securityholders which are made pursuant to the Letters of Transmittal or in
similar agreements shall survive the Closing and continue in effect until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
matters addressed therein (including any extensions or tollings thereof). The
covenants made by the Parties herein shall survive in accordance with their
respective terms, and if no specific term is specified, in perpetuity. Any
claims under this Agreement with respect to a breach of a representation and
warranty or covenant must be asserted by written notice within the applicable
survival period contemplated by this _Section 8.1_, and if such a notice is
given, the survival period for such representation and warranty shall continue
until the claim is fully resolved.

 

8.2 _Indemnification of Parent_.

(a) Pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Letters of
Transmittal, the Option Cancellation Agreements, and the Warrant Termination
Agreements and subject to the limitations contained in this _Article 8_,
Parent and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the
Surviving Company and the Company) and the stockholders, directors, officers,
partners, employees, successors, assigns, representatives and agents of each
of them in their capacities as such (the " _Parent Indemnified Persons_ "),
shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against, any and all claims,
losses, judgments, orders, damages, liabilities, expenses or costs ("
_Losses_ "), plus reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred or accrued
in connection with Losses and/or enforcement of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any other ancillary document and interest on the amount of such
Losses at the Prime Rate, as it appears in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from
the date that such Losses were actually incurred until the day immediately
prior to the date of payment to the Indemnified Party, determined based on a
360-day year (in all, " _Indemnified Losses_ "), incurred or to be incurred
by any of them resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement;

 

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance by the Company (in the case of the
Company, prior to or at the Closing) or the Representative of, any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
ancillary document;

 

(iii) any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing, but only to the extent not taken into account in determining the
Initial Merger Consideration;

(iv) any Company Transaction Expenses, but only to the extent not taken into
account in determining the Initial Merger Consideration;

 



78 (v) any claims for appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any Shares
under Delaware Law or any other applicable Law, _provided_ , that, except in
the case of claims made by the Stockholders identified in _Schedule
8.2(a)(v)_, such claims result in a per share consideration greater than the
amount of Merger Consideration such Share would have otherwise been entitled
to hereunder;

(vi) the Companys and its Subsidiaries Taxes or their liability, if any,
for Taxes of others, including, but not limited to, Securityholders or any
Affiliate of Securityholders, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of any
Straddle Period ending at 11:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the Closing
Date, but only (A) to the extent such Taxes are not reflected as a Tax
Liability in the calculation of Final Closing Net Taxes Payable and (B) to the
extent such Taxes exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) minus Final Closing Net Taxes Payable, such
number not to be less than zero (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ "); or

(vii) the matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(vii)_ (the " _Scheduled
Indemnity Matters_ ").

From and after the Closing, in consideration of the Parents agreement to pay
the Merger Consideration, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby agreed to and acknowledged), by execution of the Letters
of Transmittal, the Option Cancellation Agreements, the Warrant Termination
Agreements or other similar agreements, the Securityholders shall severally
and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless each of the Parent Indemnified
Persons from and against, and each Securityholder shall thereby waive any
claim for contribution or indemnity from any of the Parent Indemnified
Persons with respect to such Securityholders Percentage of, any Indemnified
Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Persons
resulting from, arising out of, _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ through  _Section
8.2(a)(vii)_, fraud by the Company or fraud by such Securityholder. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Percentage_ " means, with respect to
each Securityholder, the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator
of which is the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock held by such
Securityholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all
Company Options and Company Warrants held by such Securityholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time), and the denominator of which is the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock held by all Securityholders immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of all Company Options and Company Warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time). Any amounts owed to
Parent Indemnified Persons for such Indemnified Losses shall first be paid
out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and then, to
the extent that such Indemnified Losses exceed the then available balance in
the Escrow Account or indemnification for such Indemnified Losses is due
after distribution of all amounts from the Escrow Account, pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_. Except for Indemnified Losses resulting from, arising out of,
or directly or indirectly connected to such Securityholders fraud,
a Securityholders obligations under this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall not exceed
the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration paid or payable to such
Securityholder.

 



79 (b) By execution of a Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancellation Agreement,
Warrant Termination Agreement or other similar agreement, each Securityholder
shall severally and not jointly hold the Parent Indemnified Persons harmless
and indemnify each of them from and against, and each Securityholder waives
any claim for contribution or indemnity from any of the Parent Indemnified
Persons (including the Surviving Company and the Company) with respect to, any
and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of them resulting
from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Securityholder
in a Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancellation Agreement, Warrant
Termination Agreement or other similar agreement, it being agreed and
acknowledged that with respect this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ each Securityholder
is providing indemnity only with respect to breaches of representations
and warranties made by such Securityholder in a Letter of Transmittal, the
Option Cancellation Agreement, the Warrant Termination Agreement or other
similar agreement and not those of any other Securityholder in any other
Letter of Transmittal, the Option Cancellation Agreement, the Warrant
Termination Agreement or other similar agreement, and that each Securityholder
shall be liable under this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ only for the Indemnified
Losses for which such Securityholder is providing indemnity under this
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_, without being limited to such Securityholders
Percentage thereof and no other Securityholder shall be liable for any such
Indemnified Losses; or

 

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by such Securityholder of any covenant
or agreement of such Securityholder contained in such Letter of Transmittal,
Option Cancellation Agreements, Warrant Termination Agreements or other
similar agreement, it being agreed and acknowledged that with respect to
this  _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ each Securityholder is providing indemnity only
with respect to the nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other
breach or violation, or default in performance, of the covenants and
agreements made by such Securityholder in such Letter of Transmittal, Option
Cancellation Agreement, the Warrant Termination Agreement or other similar
agreement and not with respect to those of any other Securityholders in any
other Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancellation Agreement, the Warrant
Termination Agreement or other similar agreement, and that each Securityholder
shall be liable under this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ only for the Indemnified
Losses for which such Securityholder is providing indemnity under this
_Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, without being limited to such Securityholders
Percentage thereof and no other Securityholder shall be liable for any such
Indemnified Losses.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
recover any Indemnified Losses to which they are entitled hereunder from the
Company under this Agreement. From and after the Closing, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover any Indemnified Losses to
which they are entitled hereunder from the Escrow Account and the
Securityholders under this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal, the Option
Cancellation Agreements, and the Warrant Termination Agreements.

 

(d) For all Tax purposes, all indemnification payments under this _Article 8_
shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Merger Consideration to
the extent permitted by applicable law.

 



80 8.3 _Indemnification of the Securityholders_. Subject to the limitations
contained in this _Article 8_, Parent shall hold the Securityholders, and
the members, directors, officers, partners, employees, successors, assigns,
representatives and agents of each of them in their capacities as such (the
"Securityholders Indemnified Persons") harmless and indemnify each of them
from and against any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by
any of them, resulting from or arising out of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent in this
Agreement or any ancillary document; or

 

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by Parent of any covenant or agreement
of Parent contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any ancillary
document.

8.4 _Notice of Claim_. In the event that Parent seeks indemnification on
behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person, or the Representative or a
Securityholder seeks indemnification on behalf of a Securityholder Indemnified
Person, in each case other than a Third Person Claim, such Party seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall give reasonably prompt written
notice in accordance with _Section 10.1_ to the indemnifying Party (the
"Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such
claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder shall not
be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only
to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually damaged and prejudiced
thereby. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the amount of any
valid, uncontested claim not more than 30 days after the Indemnified Party
provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount. For purposes of this
_Article 8_, the Representative has the full authority to act on behalf of
the Securityholders and the Securityholder Indemnified Persons as either an
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that as set forth in
this Agreement, Parent shall be deemed to have given notice to
all Securityholders pursuant to giving notice to the Representative.

8.5 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_. 

(a) _Third Party Claims (Other than the Scheduled Indemnity Matters)_.

 

(i) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim (other than the Scheduled Indemnity Matters) asserted by any
claimant other than an Indemnified Person hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "),
the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of a Person to be indemnified
hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely
affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent
that, an Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 8.5_, the Indemnifying Party shall then
have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (a "
_Defense Notice_ ") within 30 days after receipt from the Indemnified Party
of notice of such claim, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party,

 



81  to investigate, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a
" _Third Person Claim_ "), _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party has
unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect
to such Third Person Claim and to discharge any cost or expense arising out of
such investigation, contest or settlement. Unless and until the Indemnifying
Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and
to demand and receive from the Indemnifying Party, subject to
the Indemnifying Partys right to dispute its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice within
said 30 day period, (A) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the
control over said defense and settlement of the subject claim, (B) the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified
Party such assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, (C) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the
defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and (D) the Indemnifying
Party, if it is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement,
will be liable for all costs and settlement amounts paid or incurred in
connection therewith.

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with
respect to such Third Person Claim within 30 days after receipt thereof and
thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject claim, (A) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said defense and,
subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the subject claim,
(B) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the
Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it may reasonably request,
and (C) the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its expense to
participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing. In such an
event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless (1) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (2) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full
by the Indemnifying Party; and (3) the Indemnified Party shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third Person
Claims effected without its consent, in which cases the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
8.5(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may
participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or
settlement of any claim (A) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (B) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (C) that, if unsuccessful, (1) would set a precedent that
would materially interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on,
the business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (2) would
reasonably be expected to exceed the then available balance of the Escrow
Account, as mutually determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party or, if such a determination is not made within 15 days after the date
on which the Indemnified Party responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its
rights under this _Section 8.5(a)(ii)_, in accordance with its reasonable
judgment, or (D) subject to _clause (C)(2)_ above, that imposes liability on
the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder, or, in the case of the 

 



82  Parent Indemnified Persons, is subject to a claim for indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)(v)_. In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be
subject to its obligations hereunder, but the Indemnified Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(b) _The Scheduled Indemnity Matters_.

(i) With respect to the Scheduled Indemnity Matters, Parent shall be deemed,
without any further action being required on the part of Parent on or after
the Closing Date, to have provided to the Representative written notice of
such Third Person Claim. Representative shall not have any right to deliver a
Defense Notice with respect to the Scheduled Indemnity Matters; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 8.5_, no Indemnifying Party shall be restricted from delivering a
Defense Notice with respect to any claims made by a party to the Scheduled
Indemnity Matters, which claims do not arise out of or relate to events or
circumstances that occurred at or prior to the Closing.

(ii) The Representative, in good faith and on behalf of the Securityholders,
shall administer, pursue and control the defense and prosecution of the
Scheduled Indemnity Matters, utilizing the Securityholders own counsel, which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Parent shall have the
right to participate in, but not control, the defense and prosecution of any
of the Scheduled Indemnity Matters. Parent shall bear the cost of outside
attorneys fees and expenses for any such participation. The Representative
shall not settle or compromise the Scheduled Indemnity Matters without the
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of Parent and the Indemnified Party unless the conditions set
forth on _Schedule 8.5(b)(ii)_ have been met, in which case the consent of
Parent and the Indemnified Party shall not be required. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Representative cannot agree to any license of any Company
Intellectual Property to any Third Person without the prior written consent
of Parent, which consent may be granted or withheld in Parents sole
discretion. Parent shall make available to the Representative or his
representatives all records or other materials reasonably required for use in
defending against and prosecuting the Scheduled Indemnity Matters and shall
reasonably cooperate with the Representative in the defense of the Scheduled
Indemnity Matters. Following the Closing, the Representative shall maintain,
and shall cause the Securityholders to maintain, in confidence any
confidential information relating to the Scheduled Indemnity Matters he or
they have, and such information (the " _Scheduled Indemnity Matters
Confidential Information_ ") shall not be disclosed by the Representative or
the Securityholders without Parents prior written consent, other than as the
Representative or the Securityholders deem necessary in defense or prosecution
of the litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative and the
Securityholders shall not be entitled to disclose any confidential information
relating to any Company Intellectual Property which is not subject to a
protective order on the date hereof without the Parents prior written
consent. In the event that the Representative or any of the Securityholders or
their representatives become legally compelled to disclose any Scheduled
Indemnity Matters Confidential Information, the Representative shall provide
Parent with prompt written notice before such disclosure, such that Parent
may either seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy preventing or
prohibiting such disclosure or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 8.5(b)_ or both. In the event the Representative complies with the
preceding sentence and Parent fails to obtain such a

 



83  remedy and fails to waive compliance, the Representative shall have the
right to furnish that portion of the Scheduled Indemnity Matters Confidential
Information that the Representative is legally required, as advised in
writing by the Representatives counsel, to furnish.

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be
entitled to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in the aggregate (the " _Indemnification
Threshold_ "), but thereafter shall be entitled to indemnification in respect
of all such Indemnified Losses to the full extent thereof (including the first
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) of such Indemnified Losses); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Indemnification Threshold limitation shall not apply in any
manner whatsoever to the extent the breach results from fraud.

(b) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed Twenty-One Million Dollars ($21,000,000) (the "
_Cap_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent
Indemnified Persons for any breach of _Section 2.3_ (Capitalization and
Related Matters) or  _Section 2.8_ (Taxes) hereof shall be the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) neither the Cap nor any other limitation set forth in
this _Section 8.6(b)_ shall apply in any manner whatsoever to Indemnified
Losses resulting from or arising out of fraud.

(c) The Securityholders shall not have any claim for contribution from or
against the Surviving Company as a result of any indemnification or other
payments made by any of the Securityholders to any of the Parent Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent or its representatives, of the Company or otherwise, shall in any way
limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person under this
Agreement.

(e) The amount of any Losses claimed by any Indemnified Person hereunder
shall be (i) net of any Tax savings or Tax detriments when and as actually
recognized in cash by any Indemnified Person that is attributable to such
Losses, and (ii) net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance
policies maintained by Parent or the Company; _provided_ , that any increased
insurance premiums and other costs resulting therefrom, together with costs
incurred in making, seeking and pursuing such insurance claim and obtaining
recovery, shall be Losses hereunder.

(f) Parent and the Representative shall cooperate with each other and act
in good faith with respect to resolving any claim for indemnification
hereunder.

(g) In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnified Person may seek
indemnification under this _Section 8.6_, such Indemnified Person will in its
reasonable discretion use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under available insurance coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnified Person shall have no obligation to first submit or to

 



84  collect upon any applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a
claim for indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Losses
therefor, and the Parties hereto agree, without limiting any other rights any
Indemnifying Party may have against any Indemnified Person, not to delay in
any manner the payment to any Indemnified Person of such indemnification based
on the Indemnified Persons failure to have sought insurance coverage at the
time any such claim is made. If the Indemnified Person receives any such
amounts subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party
(for which the indemnified Losses were not reduced by such amounts),
the Indemnified Person will pay over to the Indemnifying Party (which, in the
case of the Securityholders will be the Escrow Agent (to the extent that (i)
amounts have been paid to Parent out of the Escrow Account and (ii) the Escrow
Agreement remains in effect) or the Representative) the amounts of such
insurance payments promptly after they are actually recovered.

 

(h) With respect to the matter set forth on _Schedule 8.6(h)_ , for a period
from the date hereof through the 90th calendar day following the Closing
Date, the Company may take (and, from and after the Closing, Parent
specifically agrees to allow the Company to take and to allow the Company to
use the Companys internal resources to take) any commercially
reasonable actions, provided such actions do not interfere with the discharge
of duties and responsibilities by the Companys employees and are consistent
with good customer relations. The Representative shall provide periodic
updates to Parents Chief Financial Officer regarding such actions. Should
the Company or the Surviving Corporation employ independent contractors with
regard to the actions above, such fees and expenses shall be borne by the
Securityholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
Parent may also address such matter in such manner as is reasonably determined
by Parent, so long as such actions do not interfere with the first sentence.

 

(i) With respect to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(v)_ which relates
to the Stockholders identified on  _Schedule 8.2(a)(v)_, Indemnified Losses
shall include only that portion, if any, of the per share consideration
ultimately paid for Stockholders Shares that exceeds the amount of the per
Share Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder hereunder.

8.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the indemnification rights set forth in this _Article 8_,
all of which are subject to the terms, limitations, and restrictions of this
_Article 8_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after Closing for
monetary damages sustained as a result of a breach of a representation or
warranty or covenant under this Agreement, except that the foregoing shall not
apply to fraud or breach of the representations contained in _Article 3_. In
addition, such limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ shall not impair
the rights of any of the Parties: (a) to seek non-monetary equitable relief,
including (without limitation) specific performance or injunctive relief to
redress any default or breach of this Agreement, including for the provisions
of _Article 5_ hereof; or (b) to seek enforcement, collection, damages, or
such non-monetary equitable relief to redress any default or breach of any
other agreement at or prior to Closing hereunder. In connection with the
seeking of any non-monetary equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties hereto agrees the other Parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in accordance with _Section 10.9_ hereof.

damages based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to
the Securityholders).

Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by

proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that a Party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named court for any reason
other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section
10.9_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such court (whether
through judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Each Party hereto waives all
personal service of any and all process upon such Party related to this
Agreement and consents that all service of process upon such Party shall be
made by hand delivery, certified mail or confirmed facsimile directed to such
Party at the address specified in _Section 10.1_ hereof; and service made by
certified mail shall be complete seven days after the same shall have been
posted.

10.10 _No Waiver_. Any failure by any of the Parties hereto to comply with any

invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

10.12  _Amendments_. No modification, amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed
by the Parties hereto.

no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, other than Indemnified Parties
solely with respect to  _Article 8_ herein and the Company Indemnified
Persons solely with respect to _Section 1.15(a)_.

10.14  _Subsidiary Compliance_. The Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to
use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on their
parts under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

* * * * 

 



91 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Parties and is effective as of the date first herein above written.

Indemnified Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification under Section
8.2 of the Merger Agreement or other Losses pursuant to the Merger Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby at any time prior

required by Section 8.4 of the Merger Agreement (any notice from Parent under
this Section 6 shall be referred to as a " _Release Notice_ ") to the
Representative and the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Funds such
amount (the " _Claimed Amount_ "). The parties acknowledge that there may be
multiple Release Notices given by Parent during the term hereof and that any
Release Notice may be amended by Parent from time to time on or prior to the
Release Date (e.g., to increase or decrease the Claimed Amount stated
therein), any such amendment being effective as of and from the date of
delivery thereof to the Representative and the Escrow Agent. The Claimed
Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Funds to or at the
direction of Parent in accordance with the Release Notice unless the
Representative disputes the validity or amount of such claim by notifying
Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing, containing a description in reasonable
detail of the basis for the dispute and the amount in dispute (a " _Dispute
Notice_ "), within thirty (30) calendar days after Parent has provided the
Representative with its Release Notice. If a Dispute Notice has not been
delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent within the required thirty (30)
calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall promptly disburse from the Escrow
Funds to or at the direction of Parent the portion of the Escrow Funds set
forth in the Release Notice.

6.2. In the event that a Dispute Notice signed by the Representative has been
provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent within the required thirty (30)
calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall distribute promptly to or at the
direction of Parent the undisputed portion (if any) of the amount set forth
in the Release Notice, and withhold the amount in dispute (the " _Disputed
Amount_ "), which amount shall be resolved in accordance with this Section
6.2. The Disputed Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms hereof until the earlier to occur of the following: (i) the
Representative and Parent jointly direct the disbursement of the Disputed
Amount by delivering written instruction to the Escrow Agent, or (ii) the
Escrow Agent receives a copy of a final judgment or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (a " _Directive_ ") with respect to the Disputed Amount
(which judgment or order shall also be delivered by Parent to the
Representative or by the Representative to Parent, as the case may be). Upon
receipt of such instructions or Directive, or as promptly as practicable but
in no event more than three (3) calendar days after receipt of
such instructions or Directive, the Escrow Agent shall disburse or continue
to hold (as the case may be) the Disputed Amount, as required by such
instructions or Directive, as the case may be.

 

7\. _Distribution of Escrow Funds_.

7.1. _First Release Date_. Promptly following 11:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time
on December 31, 2012 (the " _First Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Representative (for distribution by the Representative to the
Securityholders in accordance with this

 



3  Section 7) any amounts in the Escrow Account, which are in excess of the
amount equal to (i) nine million three hundred thirty-three thousand three
hundred thirty-four dollars ($9,333,334) (the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ ")
_plus_ (ii) any interest earned on the Remaining Escrow Amount _plus_ (iii)
all Disputed Amounts outstanding on the First Release Date which have not
been resolved in accordance with Section 6 hereof and all Claimed Amounts
that have not then been paid to Parent or disputed by the Representative in
accordance with Section 6 hereof. Following the resolution of any Disputed
Amounts in accordance with Section 6 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall disburse
the Disputed Amounts as provided in the Directive or in written instructions
from Parent and the Representative.

 

7.2. _Second Release Date_. Promptly following the Second Release Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the Representative (for distribution by the
Representative to the Securityholders in accordance with this Section 7) the
Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account, if any; provided, however, the
Escrow Agent shall retain (and not deliver to the Representative) such Escrow
Funds in the amount equal to (i) all Disputed Amounts outstanding on the
Second Release Date which have not been resolved in accordance with Section 6
_plus_ (ii) all Claimed Amounts that have not then been paid to Parent or
disputed by the Representative in accordance with Section 6 hereof. Following
the resolution of any Disputed Amounts in accordance with Section 6 hereof,
the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Disputed Amounts as provided in the
Directive or in written instructions from Parent and the Representative.

7.3. _Distribution to Securityholders_. Upon receipt of any amounts from the
Escrow Account by the Representative, the Representative shall promptly (but
in no event later than five (5) calendar days thereafter) distribute all such
amounts (less any reimbursable expenses owed to the Representative pursuant
to Section 1.16 of the Merger Agreement ) to the Securityholders, which are
set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto with each Securityholder being
entitled to receive an amount (with respect to each such Securityholder,
such Securityholders " _Pro Rata Amount_ ") equal to the aggregate amount to
be so distributed multiplied by the Percentage set forth next to such
Securityholders name on _Exhibit A_ under the column entitled "Percentage;"
provided, however, if any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the terms
hereof were as a result of an indemnity obligation arising under Section
8.2(b) of the Merger Agreement, then (i) any Securityholder whose breach or
violation gave rise to such indemnity obligation shall not be entitled to such
Securityholders Pro Rata Amount, and instead such Securityholder shall only
be entitled to the greater of (A) $0 and (B) the difference between such
Securityholders Pro Rata Amount and the amount distributed to Parent pursuant
to the terms hereof as a result of any such indemnity obligation attributable
to such Securityholder (such amount so distributed to Parent the "
_Individual Obligation Amount_ ") and (ii) each such Individual Obligation
Amount shall be distributed to all other Securityholders in accordance with
their Percentages, with, for this purpose, such Percentages increased on a
pro rata basis as among such other Securityholders in order to allocate the
breaching Securityholders Percentage among such non-breaching
Securityholders; provided further, if at the time of any distribution by the
Representative of Escrow Funds to the Securityholders, any Disputed Amount
represents an amount that Parent has claimed it is entitled to as a result of
an indemnity obligation under Section 8.2(b) of the Merger Agreement (an "
_Individual Obligation Disputed Amount_ "), then (i) all such Escrow Funds
other than any Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall be distributed by
the Representative to the Securityholders, with each Securityholder being
entitled to receive its Pro Rata Amount, except that the Securityholder or
Securityholders whose alleged breach or violation is at issue with respect to
any such Individual Obligation Disputed

 



4  Amount shall only be entitled to receive the difference between such
Securityholders Pro Rata Amount of such distribution and the Individual
Obligation Disputed Amount attributable to such Securityholder and (ii) all
such Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall continue to be held by the
Representative until such time as the disputes with respect to such amounts
have been resolved in accordance with the terms hereof, at which time such
Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall be distributed by the
Representative in accordance with the terms hereof as if such resolution had
been known at the time of the initial distribution of such Escrow Funds.
The Representative shall deliver to each Securityholder in connection with
each distribution hereunder a statement showing the calculation of the amounts
so distributed. Promptly following each such distribution, the Representative
shall also deliver to Parent a copy of each such statement so delivered to
the Securityholders, together with a certificate certifying that all amounts
distributed were distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

 

8\. _Certain Covenants_. Parent and the Representative, on its own behalf and
on behalf of the Securityholders, hereby agree that the interest and other
income earned on the Escrow Amount shall be treated for Tax purposes as earned
by Parent. Parent and the Representative agree that the Escrow Agent shall
report such income to the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), or any other
taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099 or IRS Form 1042-S (or other appropriate
form) whether or not such income has been distributed during the taxable year.
Parent agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification
number by signing and returning an IRS Form W-9 to the Escrow Agent prior to
the date on which any income earned on the investment of the Escrow Amount is
credited to such Escrow Funds. In addition, Parent and the Representative
hereby agree that they will make all reasonable efforts to resolve as quickly
as possible any claims still pending pursuant to Section 6 or 7 at the time a
disbursement is required to be made hereunder.

 

9\. _Joint Written Instructions and Directions; Disbursements_.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall deal with the Escrow Funds, or any part thereof, at any time in
accordance with any directions given in an undisputed Release Notice or
jointly given in writing by Parent and the Representative to the Escrow Agent
or in a Directive. The parties hereto agree that all disbursements required
to be made hereunder shall be made to the Representative by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
specified in the notice directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement
and to or at the direction of Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions specified in the
notice directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement.

10\. _Provisions Concerning the Escrow Agent._

 

10.1. This Escrow Agreement sets forth, exclusively, the duties of the Escrow
Agent and no additional duties or obligations shall be inferred herefrom or
implied hereby.

10.2. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the validity of any
documents or other property delivered to it pursuant hereto, may act and rely
conclusively upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and
may assume that any person purporting to give any notice or instructions
hereunder, believed by the Escrow Agent to be authorized, has been duly
authorized so to do.

 



5 10.3. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for
any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake
of fact or law, or for anything which it may in good faith do or refrain from
doing in connection herewith, except to the extent that any act or omission
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage
of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits), even if
the Escrow Agent has been advised of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action.

10.4. The Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from, legal
counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any
of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no
liability and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith in accordance
with the advice of such counsel.

10.5. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification of this Escrow
Agreement unless it shall have specifically consented thereto in writing.

10.6. The Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
shall each upon demand pay to the Escrow Agent fifty percent (50%) of the
amount of all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel, which the Escrow Agent may incur, and its normal fees for all
services rendered, in each case in connection with the discharge of its
duties, and the exercise or enforcement of the rights of the parties
hereunder. The Escrow Agent may deduct any unpaid fees from the Escrow Funds.
In the event the Escrow Agent deducts any unpaid fees for which Parent is
responsible hereunder from the Escrow Funds, Parent shall promptly deposit
into the Escrow Account Parents portion of such unpaid fees and in the event
the Escrow Agent deducts any unpaid fees for which any of the Securityholders
is responsible hereunder from the Escrow Funds, the Representative shall
promptly deposit into the Escrow Account such Securityholders portion of such
unpaid fees.

 

10.7. The Escrow Agent may resign by giving written notice to Parent and the
Representative of such resignation, specifying a date upon which such
resignation shall take effect, which shall in no event be earlier than sixty
(60) days after the giving of such notice, and shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations upon the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent
as hereafter provided and the delivery to such successor of the Escrow Funds.
Immediately upon receipt of such notice, Parent and the Representative shall
appoint a successor Escrow Agent who shall be mutually acceptable to them. Any
such successor Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent and the Representative
and to the resigning Escrow Agent a written instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and
duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall be entitled to receive the
Escrow Funds. In the event that a successor Escrow Agent shall not be so
appointed by the date of resignation specified by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent shall have the right to appoint as a successor Escrow Agent any
national bank, and the parties hereto agree to accept any such successor
Escrow Agent appointed by the Escrow Agent.

 

10.8. In the event of any dispute between Parent or the Representative, or
between the Escrow Agent and any one or more of the other parties hereto,
with regard to the Escrow Agent or its duties, or any other matter concerning
the disposition of the Escrow Funds or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in
good faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take 

 



6  hereunder, the Escrow Agent may deposit the Escrow Funds with any court
described in Section 10.9 of the Merger Agreement pending the decision of such
court, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refrain from action pending,
and rely upon, the decision of such court. The rights of the Escrow Agent
under this Section 10.8 are cumulative of all other rights which it may have
by law or otherwise.

 

10.9. The parties to the Escrow Agreement (other than the Escrow Agent) hereby
agree that the Escrow Agent shall be indemnified from and against any loss,
liability or expense reasonably incurred, without gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
Escrow Agreement, including the expense of defending itself against any
claim or liability arising therefrom. The Escrow Agent shall not be required
to give any bond or surety or report to any court despite any statute, custom
or rule to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Representative (jointly and severally) agree that any payment required to be
made pursuant to this Section 10.9 shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent
and fifty percent (50%) by the Representative. The Escrow Agent may deduct any
unpaid amounts from the Escrow Funds. In the event the Escrow Agent deducts
any unpaid amounts for which Parent is responsible under this Section 10.9
from the Escrow Funds, Parent shall promptly deposit into the Escrow Account
Parents portion of such unpaid amounts and in the event the Escrow Agent
deducts any unpaid amounts for which the Representative is responsible
hereunder from the Escrow Funds, the Representative shall promptly deposit
into the Escrow Account the Representatives portion of such unpaid amounts.

10.10. Parent and the Representative together may terminate the appointment of
the Escrow Agent hereunder upon written notice specifying the date upon which
such termination shall take effect. In the event of such termination, Parent
and the Representative shall before the date of such termination jointly
appoint a successor Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
remaining Escrow Funds to such successor Escrow Agent.

11\. _Provisions Concerning the Representative._

11.1. Until the later of the Second Release Date or the date on which no
Escrow Funds remain held in escrow hereunder, the Representative shall, and
shall have full power and authority to, exclusively act on behalf of each
Securityholder in connection with all matters relating to this Escrow
Agreement and the Merger Agreement. The Representative shall also have full
power and authority to give and receive notices by or on behalf of each
Securityholder.

11.2. By giving notice to the Representative in the manner provided by
Section 12, a party shall be deemed to have given notice to all of the
Securityholders and any action taken by the Representative may be considered
by any other party to be the action of each such Securityholder for all
purposes, including for all purposes of this Escrow Agreement and the Merger
Agreement. In addition, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) none
of the Securityholders shall be entitled to individually take any action
which the Representative is authorized hereunder to take on behalf of such
Securityholders and (ii) the failure of the Representative to take any action
it is permitted or authorized to take hereunder on behalf of the
Securityholders during the applicable time period in which such action is
permitted to have been taken by the Representative, including, without
limitation, providing any Dispute Notice hereunder or under the Merger
Agreement, shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute a complete waiver
and release by each Securityholder of the right to individually take any such
action.

 



7 11.3. In the event that the Representative is unable or refuses to serve,
the Securityholders will promptly notify Parent and the Escrow Agent in
writing of the designation by the Securityholders of a successor to act as the
Representative hereunder.

12\. _Notices and Written Directions_. All notices, requests, demands, and
other communications required or permitted under this Escrow Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and made upon being

Wire Instructions:

 



1 With respect to those Stockholders who deliver this Letter of Transmittal
following the execution of the Merger Agreement, completion and delivery of
this Letter of Transmittal with respect to the Shares constitutes assent to
the terms of the Merger and constitutes a waiver by the Stockholder of any
appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any Shares under the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), as the case may be, whether or not the
Stockholder has previously made a written demand upon the Company and
otherwise complied with the appraisal rights provisions of the DGCL.

In order to induce Parent to cause U.S. Bank, N.A. (the "Exchange Agent") to
issue the consideration for the Shares called for by the Merger Agreement,
the Stockholder hereby expressly agrees with Parent as follows:

1\. _Merger Agreement; Escrow Agreement_. The Stockholder acknowledges receipt
of a copy of the Merger Agreement (included herewith) and the Escrow Agreement
(included herewith). The Stockholder has reviewed those documents and the
terms of the Merger described therein. The Stockholder has also reviewed such
other materials as the Stockholder has deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purposes of this Letter of Transmittal. The Stockholder understands that the
Escrow Amount will be retained in the Escrow Account to satisfy, at least in
part, any claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any post-closing adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.11 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) any Parent Indemnified
Person for any indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant
to Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement or (iii) any Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to the Merger Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees
to be subject to and bound by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form included herewith, with
such changes as the officers of the Company may approve. The Stockholder
further acknowledges that the Merger Consideration is subject to certain
adjustments more specifically described in Section 1.4 to the Merger
Agreement.

 

2\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Stockholder hereby makes the
following representations and warranties to Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary
and the Surviving Company, each of which is true and correct on the date
hereof and on the Closing Date and each of which shall survive the Closing.

 

a. _Organization of the Stockholder_. If the Stockholder is not a natural
person, the Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

b. _Authority_. The Stockholder has full power and authority to enter into
this Letter of Transmittal, to perform his, her or its obligations thereunder,
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger
Agreement. This Letter of Transmittal constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability hereof or
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors generally and general equitable principles.

c. _No Violation_. The Stockholder is not a party to, subject to or bound by
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, agreement, lien, contract
or other instrument or obligation or any statute, law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, injunction, or decree of any court, administrative or
regulatory body, governmental agency, arbitrator, mediator or similar body,
franchise or license, which would (i) conflict with or be breached or violated
or the obligations thereunder accelerated, increased, extinguished or
terminated (whether or not with notice or lapse of time or both) by the
execution, delivery or performance by the Stockholder of this Letter of
Transmittal or (ii) prevent the carrying out of the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Merger Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby or
thereby. No permit, consent, waiver, approval or authorization of, or
declaration to or filing or registration with, any third person or Government
is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the
Stockholder of this Letter of Transmittal, or the consummation by the
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger
Agreement. The execution of this Letter of Transmittal and the consummation
by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger
Agreement will not result in the creation of any Liens against the Company or
the Stockholder or any of the properties or assets of any of them. If
the Stockholder is not a natural person, none of the execution and delivery
of this Letter of Transmittal by the Stockholder, the performance by the
Stockholder of its obligations hereunder, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement will violate,
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the certificate or
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other similar charter or organizational
documents of the Stockholder.

 

d. _Shares_. The Stockholder holds of record and owns beneficially the number
of shares of capital stock of the Company set forth next to his, her or its
name on Schedule 2.3(b) of the Merger Agreement, free and clear of any Liens.
The Stockholder further represents that the above described Certificate(s)
represent all of the Shares owned by the 

 



2  Stockholder and that the undersigned has no right, entitlement or
expectation (other than existing Options and Warrants held by the Stockholder)
to acquire or receive any additional shares of capital stock in the Company
or any dividends, distributions or other payments in respect of the Shares
owned by the Stockholder (other than (1) the Stockholder Dividend (as defined
in the Information Statement) which will be paid prior to the consummation of
the Merger and (2) the cash consideration payable in connection with the
Merger). Except as set forth on Schedule 2(d) hereto, the Stockholder is not a
party to any option, warrant, purchase right or other contract or
commitment (other than this Letter of Transmittal or an Option Cancellation
Agreement) that could require the Stockholder to sell, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of any capital stock or other equity interest of the Company. Except
as set forth on Schedule 2(d) hereto, there are no stockholder agreements,
buy-sell agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Stockholder is a party or to which he, she or it is bound relating
to any shares of capital stock or other equity interest in the Company.

e. _Representation by Counsel_. The Stockholder: (a) has been represented by
independent counsel (or has had the opportunity to consult with independent
counsel and has declined to do so); (b) has had the full right and opportunity
to consult with the Stockholders attorney and other advisors and has availed
himself, herself or itself of this right and opportunity; (c) has carefully
read and fully understands this Letter of Transmittal in its entirety and has
had it fully explained to him, her or it by such counsel; (d) is fully aware
of the contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal effect thereof; and
(e) is competent to execute this Letter of Transmittal and has executed this
Letter of Transmittal free from coercion, duress or undue influence. As of the
date hereof, there is no action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding
pending, or to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the
Stockholder before any court or arbitrator or any Government authority which
challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement. As of
the date hereof, to the Stockholders knowledge, the Stockholder is not, and
none of its properties is, subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award that would prevent, delay or impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Stockholder
understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement
in reliance upon the Stockholders execution and delivery of this Letter of
Transmittal. The Stockholder has received and carefully reviewed the Anue
Systems, Inc. Information Statement and Notice of Action By Written Consent
and Appraisal Rights dated May 4, 2012 (the "Information Statement")
delivered together with this Letter of Transmittal. The Stockholder has had
the opportunity to ask the Company any and all questions the Stockholder may
have with respect to the Information Statement, the Merger Agreement and any
related documents and has also had the opportunity to consult with the
Stockholders tax, financial, legal and other advisors regarding the same.

 

3\. _Federal Income Tax Considerations_. Each Stockholder who is a U.S. person
and who is to receive the Stockholder Dividend from the Company and the
Merger Consideration in the Merger will be required to furnish the
Stockholders current social security number or taxpayer identification number
on an enclosed Substitute Form W-9 to both the Company and the
Exchange Agent. Each Stockholder who is a Non-U.S. person and who is to
receive the Stockholder Dividend from the Company and the Merger Consideration
in the Merger will be required to furnish the appropriate Form W-8. The
undersigned acknowledges that failure to provide this information may result
in backup withholding. Such forms, if required, should be completed and
submitted with this Letter of Transmittal.

EACH STOCKHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT WITH THE STOCKHOLDERS OWN TAX ADVISOR
REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

4\. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Letter of Transmittal, the Stockholder
agrees to use his, her or its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited
to, (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Government authorities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Government, (ii) timely making all necessary filings under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii)
the performance of the Companys obligations under the Merger Agreement, (iv)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties; provided, however, that in no event shall the Stockholder be required
to pay any amount of money in order to obtain such third party consent, (v)
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Letter of Transmittal or the Merger Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Government vacated or reversed, and (vi) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to

 



3  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Letter of Transmittal and the Merger Agreement. In
consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall comply with all applicable Laws.

5\. _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_. Except as may be required by
applicable Law, the Stockholder shall not issue any press release, make any
such statement or communication or schedule any press conference or conference
call with respect to the Merger Agreement or this Letter of Transmittal or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the written consent of
Parent. Following the Closing, the Stockholder shall maintain in confidence
any information it may have in relation to Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Company and such information shall not be disclosed or used by
Stockholder without Parents prior written consent, unless such information is
(i) otherwise publicly available as of the date of this Letter of Transmittal
other than as the result of an unauthorized disclosure or (ii) required to be
disclosed pursuant to applicable Law.

6\. _Release_.

a. Effective upon the Closing, the Stockholder hereby irrevocably waives,
releases and discharges Parent, the Company or, from and after the Closing,
the Surviving Company, and any of their respective Affiliates, and the owners
of each of the foregoing, and the directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents, representatives, heirs, administrators, predecessors,
attorneys, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the "Releasees")
from any and all liabilities and obligations of any kind or nature whatsoever,
in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder, manager, member, officer,
director or employee of the Company or any other capacity, in each case
whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown,
disclosed or undisclosed, and whether arising under any agreement or
understanding (other than this Letter of Transmittal, the Merger Agreement,
any Option Cancellation Agreement, any Warrant Termination Agreement and any
of the other agreements executed and delivered in connection with the Merger
Agreement) or otherwise at law or equity, and the Stockholder agrees that he,
she or it shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or
thereunder from any of the Releasees; provided, that the waivers contained in
this Section 6 shall not apply to (i) claims against Parent asserted pursuant
to this Letter of Transmittal, the Merger Agreement, any Option Cancellation
Agreement and any Warrant Termination Agreement, (ii) any claims for which the
facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim first occur following
Closing, or (iii) obligations to current employees, officers or directors
relating to the payment or provisions of wages, salaries, bonuses, benefits,
expense reimbursements and perquisites incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business and accrued or payable at Closing (except for indemnification and
insurance provided to officers and directors by the Company as provided in
_Section 1.15_ of the Merger Agreement). In furtherance of the foregoing,
except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder hereby
agrees that he, she or it shall not make any claim for indemnification against
any Releasee by reason of the fact that the Stockholder is or was a
stockholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of their
Affiliates (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines,
costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and whether
such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or
otherwise) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or
demand brought against the Stockholder, and the Stockholder hereby
acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it shall not have any claim or right
to contribution or indemnity from any Releasee with respect to any amounts
paid by he, she or it pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal or the Merger
Agreement.

b. The Stockholder affirms that the matters covered by the preceding
paragraphs include, without limitation, (i) any claims under the securities
or other laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof, or any
foreign jurisdiction, relating to the Merger or the ownership of any of the
Shares, (ii) any claims challenging or disputing the validity,
enforceability, binding effect or legality of the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) any claims for breach of
fiduciary duty arising from any actions or inactions at or prior to the
Closing Date, including, without limitation, related to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

c. The Stockholder agrees that nothing in this release is an admission by
either the Stockholder or any Releasee of any wrongdoing, either in violation
of an applicable law or otherwise, and that nothing in this Letter of
Transmittal is to be construed as such by any Person. The Stockholder further
acknowledges that he, she or it understands this release, the claims he, she
or it is releasing, the promises and agreements he, she or it is making, and
the effect of his, her or its signing this Letter of Transmittal.

d. The Stockholder hereby waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law
which, if applied to this release, would exclude from its binding effect any
claim against the Releasees not now known by the Stockholder to exist. This
release is intended to be a general release and a covenant not to sue that
extinguishes all claims released above and precludes any attempt by the
Stockholder to initiate any litigation against the Releasees with respect to
the claims released above. If

 



4  the Stockholder commences or continues any claim in violation of this
release, the Releasees shall be entitled to assert this release as a complete
bar. This release is binding on the Stockholder and his, her or its
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns, in their own
right, and in the rights of others.

e. Solely with respect to the claims released hereunder, Stockholder expressly
waives and relinquishes to the fullest extent permitted by law (and to the
extent applicable), the provisions, rights, and benefits of Section 1542 of
the California Civil Code, which provides:

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

 

f. The Stockholder hereby acknowledges that he, she or it has been advised to
consult with an attorney before executing this Letter of Transmittal and
otherwise in connection with the Merger and all actions contemplated by the
Merger and the Merger Agreement and the related documents and that the
Stockholder has done so or, after careful reading and consideration has chosen
not to do so of the Stockholders own volition. The Stockholder hereby
acknowledges that he, she or it has signed this release knowingly and
voluntarily and with the advice of any counsel retained to advise the
Stockholder with respect to this release.

7\. _Indemnification_. Article 8 of the Merger Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by this reference. By virtue of such incorporation by
reference, the parties hereto shall be entitled to all of the benefits, and
subject to all of the obligations, contained in such Article.

8\. _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Time, this Letter of Transmittal
shall be terminated without further action required by any party in the event
that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 9 of the
Merger Agreement; provided that nothing contained in this Letter of
Transmittal shall relieve any party from any liability for any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of this Letter of Transmittal prior to
the termination. Following Closing, this Letter of Transmittal shall remain
in full force and effect notwithstanding the death or incapacity of one or
more or the Stockholder, and shall be binding upon the heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the Stockholder.

9\. _Further Actions_. The Stockholder will, upon request, execute
and deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed appropriate or
necessary by the Exchange Agent in connection with the surrender of the
certificates that formerly represented the Shares. From and after the Closing,
Stockholder shall do such acts and execute such documents and instruments as
may be reasonably required to make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Merger Agreement.

10\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

a. _Assignment; Binding Letter of Transmittal_. This Letter of Transmittal
and the various rights and obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective successors,
heirs, devisees, legatees, legal representatives and permitted assigns
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation,
reorganization or otherwise). Neither this Letter of Transmittal nor any of
the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be transferred,
delegated, or assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) by the Stockholder.

b. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Letter of Transmittal may be
executed simultaneously in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Letter of Transmittal may be executed by

7 INSTRUCTIONS TO LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement referred to in the Letter of Transmittal, the
Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company and the
outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock will be converted into the
right to receive the Initial Merger Consideration. In order to receive payment
of the Merger Consideration, the certificates or other documentation that
formerly represented Shares (the "Certificates") must be forwarded in
accordance with the following instructions. Capitalized terms used but
otherwise not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the Merger Agreement.



     | 1. | Letter of Transmittal. 
---|---|--- 
 

The Letter of Transmittal should be properly filled in, signed and returned,
together with the surrendered Certificates, to the Company at the address set
forth above. The Letter of Transmittal and Certificates may be mailed or
delivered by hand to the address shown on the face of this Letter of
Transmittal. In addition, pursuant to Instruction 6 below, the undersigned
Stockholder may be required to submit the attached Substitute Form W-9 or
other appropriate form to each of the Company and the Exchange Agent to
prevent backup withholding on any cash payment made to a Stockholder with
respect to the Stockholder Dividend or Shares surrendered in connection with
the Merger Agreement and any interest earnings on the Escrow Amount. The
method of delivery of all documents is at the option and risk of the
surrendering Stockholder, but if sent by mail, registered mail with
return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended.



     | 2. | Certificates in Different Names. 
---|---|--- 

This Letter of Transmittal may be used to submit more than one Certificate
only if all of the Certificates are registered in exactly the same name.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many Letters
of Transmittal as there are different registrations of Certificates. If the
Merger Consideration is to be issued to someone other than the registered
owner(s) of the surrendered Certificate(s), the Certificate(s) must be
duly endorsed in blank by the registered owner(s) thereof or accompanied by a
duly executed instrument of assignment in blank, and the signature to the
endorsement or assignment must be guaranteed by a commercial bank or trust
company (not a savings bank) or a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and the information under "Transfer Instructions" must be
supplied. If any of the Merger Consideration is to be mailed to an address
different from the record address of your Shares, provide the information
under "Special Mailing Instructions."



     | 3. | Signatures. 
---|---|--- 

This Letter of Transmittal shall be signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Certificates submitted herewith. The signatures must correspond with the
name(s) as set forth on the face of the Certificate(s), without alteration,
enlargement or any change whatsoever. If the Certificate(s) submitted
herewith are held of record by two or more joint owners, all such holders must
sign this Letter of Transmittal.

If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificates are signed by trustees,
executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of
corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such
persons should so indicate when signing and proper evidence satisfactory to
the Exchange Agent of their authority so to act must be submitted.

 



     | 4. | Lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificates. 
---|---|--- 

The Exchange Agent reserves the right to require additional documentation
and/or an indemnity bond in the case of lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
Certificates. If your Certificates have been lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed, please contact the Company in writing for instructions.

 



1 ---|---|--- 

All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
Certificates hereunder will be determined by the Exchange Agent, and such
determination will be final and binding. The Exchange Agent reserves the
right to waive any irregularities or defects in the surrender of any
Certificates, and its interpretations of the terms and conditions of this
Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to such
irregularities or defects will be final and binding. A surrender will not be
deemed to have been made until all irregularities have been cured or waived.



     | 6. | Important Tax Information. 
---|---|--- 
 

Under the United States federal income tax laws, a Stockholder who receives a
dividend payment, including in connection with the Stockholder Dividend, or
whose Shares are surrendered herewith is required to provide the Company (with
respect to a dividend payment) or the Exchange Agent (with respect to payment
for Shares) with such Stockholders current Taxpayer Identification Number
("TIN") on the enclosed Substitute Form W-9. If such Stockholder is an
individual, the TIN is his or her Social Security number. For businesses and
other entities, the number is the Employer Identification Number. If the
Company or the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN, the
Stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS"). In addition, the Stockholder Dividend or the Merger
Consideration to which the Stockholder is entitled with respect to Shares
surrendered in connection with the Merger and any interest earnings on the
Escrow Amount may be subject to backup withholding.

 

Certain Stockholders are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. See the enclosed W-9 Guidelines for additional instructions.
Exempt Stockholders should furnish their TIN, check the box labeled "Exempt
Payee" on the Substitute Form W-9, and sign, date and return the Substitute
Form W-9 to the Company or the Exchange Agent.

 

If backup withholding applies, the Company or the Exchange Agent may be
required to withhold a portion of any cash payment made to the Stockholder
with respect to the Stockholder Dividend or Shares surrendered in connection
with the Merger Agreement and any interest earnings on the Escrow Account. The
backup withholding rate is currently 28% but is scheduled to be increased to
31% beginning January 1, 2013. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, the amount of backup withholding is treated as an advance payment of a
tax liability, and a Stockholders U.S. federal income tax liability will be
reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an
overpayment of taxes, a refund from the IRS may be obtained by the
Stockholder. Failure to comply truthfully with the backup withholding
requirements may also result in the imposition of severe criminal and/or
civil fines and penalties.

_Purpose of Substitute Form W-9_

 

To prevent backup withholding on any cash payment made to a Stockholder with
respect to the Stockholder Dividend or Shares surrendered in connection with
the Merger Agreement and any interest earnings on the Escrow Amount, the
Stockholder is required to notify the Company and the Exchange Agent of his or
her correct TIN by completing the enclosed Substitute Form W-9 and
certifying that the TIN provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that
such Stockholder is awaiting a TIN). A Stockholder is also required to certify
on Substitute Form W-9 that (i) the Stockholder is exempt from backup
withholding, or (ii) the Stockholder has not been notified by the IRS that it
is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all
interest or dividends, or (iii) the IRS has notified the holder that the
Stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. In addition, the
Stockholder must provide its name and address, check the appropriate box
regarding its classification for federal tax purposes, and date and sign as
indicated.

 



2 _What Number to Give the Company and the Exchange Agent_

 

The Stockholder is required to give the Company and the Exchange Agent the
Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number of the record owner
of the Shares for his, her, or its Stockholder Dividend and the Shares being
surrendered for payment in connection with the Merger Agreement. See the
enclosed W-9 Guidelines for additional information.

 

 _Substitute Form W-8 for Foreign Persons_

If the surrendering Stockholder is a nonresident alien or foreign entity not
subject to backup withholding, instead of submitting a Substitute Form W-9,
such Stockholder must give the Company and the Exchange Agent the appropriate
Form W-8, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such Stockholders
foreign status. If a nonresident alien or foreign entity Stockholder does not
provide the Company and the Exchange Agent with the appropriate Form W-8, the
Stockholder will be subject to backup withholding on reportable payments.

 



3 Please complete _both_ of the Substitute Form W-9s included herewith and
return them to the Company with your properly completed Letter of Transmittal
and surrendered Certificates.

Purpose of Form

A person who is required to file an information return with the IRS must get
your correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") to report, for example,
income paid to you, real estate transactions, mortgage interest you paid,
acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt,
or contributions you made to an IRA. Use Form W-9 only if you are U.S. person
(including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN to the requester
(the person requesting your TIN) and, when applicable, to (1) certify the TIN
you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued), (2)
certify you are not subject to backup withholding, or (3) claim exemption from
backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also
certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership
income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on
foreign partners share of effectively connected income. The TIN provided must
match the name given on the Substitute Form W-9.

Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a
U.S. person if you are:

 



     |  |  |

An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in
the United States or under the laws of the United States,  

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

An estate (other than a foreign estate), or 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 

---|---|---|--- 

Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business
in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax on any
foreign partners share of income from such business. Further, in certain
cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, a partnership is required to
presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the withholding tax.
Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership
conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the
partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid withholding on your share
of partnership income. The person who gives Form W-9 to the partnership
for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or
business in the United States is in the following cases:

 



     |  |  |

The U.S. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity, 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

The U.S. grantor or other owner of a grantor trust and not the trust, and 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

The U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the
trust. 

---|---|---|--- 
 

Foreign person. If you are a foreign person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on
Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).

Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate
U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a
provision known as a "saving clause." Exceptions specified in the saving
clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of
income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax
purposes.

 

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in
the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax
on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that
specifies the following five items:

1\. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which
you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.

2\. The treaty article addressing the income. 

3\. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the
saving clause and its exceptions.

 

4\. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax. 

 

5\. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the
treaty article.

 

 _Example._ Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily
present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a
resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States
exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the
U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20
to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien
of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception
(under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to
claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income
would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described
above to support that exemption.

 

If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup
withholding, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8.

 

Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get
an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).
Enter this number in the social security number box. If you do not have an
ITIN, see _How to get a TIN_ below.

If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your
SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN. If you are a
single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner,
enter the owners SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the
disregarded entitys EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or
partnership, enter the entitys EIN.

Page 3

How to Get a TIN

If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an
SSN, obtain Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, at the local
office of the Social Security Administration or get this form on-line at
_www.ssa.gov/online/ss-5.pdf_. You may also get this form by calling
1-800-772-1213. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website
at _www.irs.gov/businesses_ and clicking on Employer ID Numbers under Related
Topics. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification
Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer
Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4
from the IRS by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676) or from the IRS web
site at www.irs.gov.

 

If you do not have a TIN, write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign
and date the Substitute Form W-9 and Certification of Awaiting Taxpayer
Identification Number, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend
payments and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable
instruments, you will generally have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the
requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The
60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to
backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the
requester.

 

Note: Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon.

 

CAUTION: A disregarded domestic entity that has a foreign owner must use the
appropriate Form W-8.

 

Payees Exempt from Backup Withholding

 

Individuals (including sole proprietors) are NOT exempt from backup
withholding. Corporations are exempt from backup withholding for certain
payments, such as interest and dividends.

Note: If you are exempt from backup withholding, you should still complete
Substitute Form W-9 to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding. If you
are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup withholding,
give the requester the appropriate completed 

  

 Form W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status.

The following is a list of payees that may be exempt from backup withholding
and for which no information reporting is required. For interest and
dividends, all listed payees are exempt except for those listed in item (9).

registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who regularly acts as a
broker are exempt. Payments subject to reporting under sections 6041 and 6041A
are generally exempt from backup withholding only if made to payees described
in items (1) through (7). However, the following payments made to a
corporation (including gross proceeds paid to an attorney under section
6045(f), even if the attorney is a corporation) and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: (i) medical and health care
payments, (ii) attorneys fees, and (iii) payments for services paid by a
federal executive agency. Only payees described in items (1) through (5) are
exempt from backup withholding for barter exchange transactions and patronage
dividends.

Payments Exempt from Backup Withholding

Certain payments that are not subject to information reporting are also not
subject to backup withholding. For details, see sections 6041, 6041A, 6042,
6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A and 6050N, and their regulations. The following
payments are not generally subject to backup withholding:

_Privacy Act Notice._ Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you
to give your correct TIN to persons who must file information returns with the
IRS to report interest, dividends, and certain other income paid to you,
mortgage interest you paid, the acquisition or abandonment of secured
property, cancellation of debt, or contributions you made to an IRA or Archer
MSA or HSA. The IRS uses the numbers for identification purposes and to help
verify the accuracy of your tax return. The IRS may also provide this
information to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and
to cities, states, and the District of Columbia to carry out their tax laws.
The IRS may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax
treaty, or to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal
laws and to combat terrorism.

 

You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax
return. Payers must generally withhold 28% (31% beginning January 1, 2013) of
taxable interest, dividends, and certain other payments to a payee who does
not give a TIN to a payer. The penalties described below may also apply.

Updating Your Information

You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need
to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be
an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must
furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account, for
example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

 

Penalties

Failure to Furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a payer,
you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure
is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

 

Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to Withholding. If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition of
backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information. Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.

Misuse of TINs. If the payer discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal
law, the payer may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the right
of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect thereto
to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation made by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation; and

 

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at what time
and place, and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books
of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of any

serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a director,
officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, or as the representative
of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity,
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent legally permissible under the DGCL, as amended from time to time,
against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably paid
or incurred by such person in connection therewith. Such right of

desired by such person. Such right of indemnification shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if
ultimately it should be determined that such person is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation under the DGCL. Such right of
indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such
directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and,
without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to
their respective rights of indemnification under any Bylaw of the Corporation,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, provision of law
or otherwise, as well as their rights under this Article.

time with respect to indemnification to provide at all times the fullest
indemnification permitted by the DGCL, as amended from time to time, and may
cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its
benefit as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, or
as the representative of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other entity, against any expense, liability or loss asserted
against or incurred by any such person in any such capacity or arising out of
any such status, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss.

 



2 C. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions in this Article
shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred upon stockholders, directors and officers herein are granted

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within
or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of
Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at
the annual meeting.

 

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of
the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors, to be held at such
date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be
stated in the notice of the meeting.

 

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and,
in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice
of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days
before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

 

Section 1.4. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place,
and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and
place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which
might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws,
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of stock
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. For purposes of the foregoing, two or more classes
or series of stock shall be considered a single class if the holders thereof
are entitled to vote together as a single class at the meeting. In the absence
of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by  majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided
by Section 1.4 of these bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own
capital stock belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation
or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to
its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the Vice Chairman
of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in his absence by
a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman
designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation
by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of
the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any
person to act as secretary of the meeting.

 

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him
which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled
to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or
persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another
duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the
Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot
and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon
present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. At all
meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, a plurality of the
votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions
shall, unless otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation
or these bylaws, be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in
person or by proxy at the meeting, provided that (except as otherwise required
by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation) the Board of Directors may
require a larger vote upon any election or question.

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled
to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall
not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting,
nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. If no record date is
fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to express consent to

 



2  corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent is
expressed; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts
the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary shall
prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged
in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days
prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is
to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or,
if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

 

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required by law to
be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation,
or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice
and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without
a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing.

such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, vacancies and
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors or from any other cause may be filled by a majority of
the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole
remaining director.

 



3 Section 2.3. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at
such times as the Board may from time to time determine, and if so determined,
notice thereof need not be given.

 

Section 2.4. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware
whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, by the Vice Chairman of

the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee designated by the Board, may participate in a
meeting of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this by law shall constitute presence
in person at such meeting.

 

Section 2.6. _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of the Board
of Directors one third of the entire Board shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board unless the

greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board a quorum shall not be
present, the members of the Board present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum shall attend.

 

Section 2.7. _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the
Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in
their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as
secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may
appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section 2.8. _Informal Action by Directors_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any
committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board
or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the
writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or
committee.

ARTICLE III

_Committees_

 

Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. The bylaws may provide that in the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at
any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or

 



4  members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the
resolution of the board of directors, or in the bylaws of the Corporation,
shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation;
but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the
following matter: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the
stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by these bylaws to be
submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or
repealing any bylaw of the Corporation.

majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of
the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then
present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts
its business pursuant to Article II of these bylaws.

Section 4.1. _Officers; Election; Qualification; Term of Office; Resignation;
Removal; Vacancies_. As soon as practicable after the annual meeting of
stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall elect a President and
a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from among its members a
Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board may also
elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Vice Presidents, one
or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or more Assistant
Treasurers and may give any of them such further designations or alternate
titles as it considers desirable. Each such officer shall hold office until
the first meeting of the Board after the annual meeting of stockholders next
succeeding his election, and until his successor is elected and qualified or
until his earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may resign at any time
upon written notice to the Board or to the President or the Secretary of the
Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein,
and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such resignation
shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may remove any officer with
or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall be without prejudice to
the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the Corporation, but the
election or appointment of an officer shall not of itself create contractual
rights. Any number of offices may be held by the same person. Any vacancy
occurring in any office of the Corporation by death, resignation, removal or
otherwise may be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Board at
any regular or special meeting.

Section 4.2. _Powers and Duties of Executive Officers_. The officers of the
Corporation shall have such powers and duties in the management of the
Corporation as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors and, to the extent
not so provided, as generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to

5 ARTICLE V

_Stock_

Section 5.1. _Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall
be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation
by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the
President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant
Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation,
certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation. If such
certificate is manually signed by one officer or manually countersigned by a
transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on the certificate may
be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall
have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue.

 

Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the
Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be

such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors
need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws.

Section 6.4. _Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees_. The
Corporation shall have the power to indemnify to the full extent authorized by
law, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person made or
threatened to be made a party to any 

 



6  action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or
was a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or any predecessor of
the Corporation or serves or served any other enterprise as a director,
officer, or employee at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor of
the Corporation against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such action, suit or
proceeding.

Section 6.5.  _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction
between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable
solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present
at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or
their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the Board or the committee, and the Board or committee in good
faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation
as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a
committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be
counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or
of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

Section 6.6. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in
the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of
account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards,
magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information storage
device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly
legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any
records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.

Section 6.7. _Amendment of Bylaws_. These bylaws may be altered or repealed,
and new bylaws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders may make
additional bylaws and may alter or repeal any by law whether or not adopted by
them.

 



7 Exhibit F

WARRANT TERMINATION AGREEMENT

This Warrant Termination Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), is made this 4th
day of May 2012, by and between Anue Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and the undersigned holder of the Anue Systems, Inc.
Warrant (the " _Warrant_ ") to purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock
dated April 25, 2011 to NYR, LLC (the " _Holder_ "). Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the
Company, Ixia, a California corporation (" _Parent_ "), Emily Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(" _Acquisition Subsidiary_ "), and Alexander Pepe, as the Representative
(the " _Representative_ "), dated May 4, 2012 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
on the Closing Date and as of the Effective Time, Acquisition Subsidiary will
merge with and into the Company with (i) the Company being the surviving
corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_
") and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of the Companys Common Stock
(subject to certain exceptions), each Company Option and each Company Warrant
being extinguished and converted into only the right to receive the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, the Holder wishes to irrevocably
cancel the Warrant and convert the Warrant into the right to receive, upon
consummation of the Merger, the consideration described below.

1\. _Cancellation of Warrant_. The Holder hereby acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees that: (a) the Warrant (whether or not vested or exercisable) is hereby
surrendered, cancelled and terminated, effective as of the Effective Time; and
(b) the Warrant will cease to exist and will be automatically cancelled and
retired and the Holder will cease to have any rights or obligations with
respect to the Warrant as of the Effective Time, other than those set forth in
_Section 2_ of this Agreement.

applicable Law.

9\. _Release_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, the Holder hereby irrevocably waives, releases
and discharges Parent, the Company or, from and after the Closing, the
Surviving Company, and any of their respective Affiliates, and the owners of
each of the foregoing, and the directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, heirs, administrators, predecessors,
attorneys, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Releasees_
") from any and all liabilities and obligations to it of any kind or nature
whatsoever, in its capacity as a Holder, manager, member, officer, director or
employee of the Company or any other capacity, in each case whether absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, disclosed or
undisclosed, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding (other
than this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, and any of the other agreements
executed and delivered in connection with the Merger Agreement) or otherwise
at law or equity, and the Holder agrees that it shall not seek to recover any
amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from any of the Releasees;
provided, that the waivers contained in this _Section 9_ shall not apply to
(i) claims against Parent asserted pursuant to this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement, (ii) any claims for which the facts or circumstances giving rise
to such claim first occur following Closing, or (iii) obligations relating to
the payment or provisions of wages, salaries, bonuses, benefits, expense
reimbursements and perquisites due to such Holders as an employee, officer or
director incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business and accrued or payable at
Closing (except for indemnification and insurance provided to officers and
directors by the Company as provided in Section 1.15 of the Merger
Agreement). In furtherance of the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in
the Merger Agreement, the Holder hereby agrees that it shall not make any
claim for indemnification against any Releasee by reason of the fact that the
Holder is or was a Holder, member,

 



4  director, manager, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of their Affiliates (whether such
claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in
settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant
to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or otherwise) with respect
to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand brought against
the Holder, and the Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall not
have any claim or right to contribution or indemnity from any Releasee with
respect to any amounts paid by it pursuant to this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement.

(b) The Holder affirms that the matters covered by the preceding paragraph
includes, without limitation, (i) any claims under the securities or other
laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof, or any foreign
jurisdiction, relating to the Merger or the ownership of the Warrant, (ii) any
claims challenging or disputing the validity, enforceability, binding effect
or legality of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
and (iii) any claims for breach of fiduciary duty arising from any actions or
inactions at or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) The Holder agrees that nothing in this release is an admission by either
the Holder or any Releasee of any wrongdoing, either in violation of an
applicable law or otherwise, and that nothing in this Agreement is to be
construed as such by any Person. The Holder further acknowledges that it
understands this release, the claims it is releasing, the promises
and agreements it is making, and the effect of its signing this Agreement.

(d) The Holder hereby waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law which,
if applied to this release, would exclude from its binding effect any claim
against the Releasees not now known by the Holder to exist. This release is
intended to be a general release and a covenant not to sue that extinguishes
all claims released above and precludes any attempt by the Holder to initiate
any litigation against the Releasees with respect to the claims released
above. If the Holder commences or continues any claim in violation of this
release, the Releasees shall be entitled to assert this release as a complete
bar. This release is binding on the Holder and its heirs, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns, in their own right, and in the
rights of others.

 

(e) Solely with respect to the claims released hereunder, the Holder expressly
waives and relinquishes to the fullest extent permitted by law (and to the
extent applicable), the provisions, rights, and benefits of Section 1542 of
the California Civil Code, which provides:

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor."

(f) The Holder hereby acknowledges that it has been advised to consult with
an attorney before executing this Agreement and otherwise in connection with
the Merger and all actions contemplated by the Merger and the Merger Agreement
and the related

 



5  documents and that the Holder has done so or, after careful reading and
consideration has chosen not to do so of the Holders own volition. The Holder
hereby acknowledges that it has signed this release knowingly and voluntarily
and with the advice of any counsel retained to advise the Holder with respect
to this release.

10\. _Indemnification_. Article 8 of the Merger Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by this reference. By virtue of such incorporation by
reference, the parties hereto shall be entitled to all of the benefits, and
subject to all of the obligations, contained in such Article.

11\. _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement shall be
terminated without further action required by any party in the event that the
Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 9 of the Merger
Agreement; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve
any party from any liability for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach
of this Agreement prior to the termination. Following Closing, this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the death or incapacity
of the Holder, and shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the Holder.

12\. _Further Actions_. The Holder will, upon request, execute and deliver any
additional documents reasonably deemed appropriate or necessary by the Company
in connection with the surrender of the Warrant. From and after the Closing,
the Holder shall do such acts and execute such documents and instruments as
may be reasonably required to make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Merger Agreement.

 

13\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

(a) _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and the various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties and their respective successors, heirs, devisees, legatees,
legal representatives and permitted assigns (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise). Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, delegated, or assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) by the
Holder.

(b) _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature(s).

Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each party agrees that any
ambiguity herein should not be construed against the draftsman.

rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative and
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law.

(e) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in
accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to its choice of law rules. 

(f) _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by a
party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the
federal or state courts located in the State of Delaware, County of New

13(f)_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such court (whether

brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such court. Each party hereto waives all
personal service of any and all process upon such party related to this
Agreement and consents that all service of process upon such party shall be
made by hand delivery, certified mail or confirmed telecopy directed to such
party at the address specified in this Agreement; and service made by

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that

OPTION CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

This Option Cancellation Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), is made this [*]
day of [*] 2012, by and between Anue Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the undersigned holder of Options (the "
_Optionholder_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the
Company, Ixia, a California corporation (" _Parent_ "), Emily Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(" _Acquisition Subsidiary_ "), and Alexander Pepe, as the Representative
(the " _Representative_ "), dated May 4, 2012 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
on the Closing Date and as of the Effective Time, Acquisition Subsidiary will
merge with and into the Company, with (i) the Company being the surviving
corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_
") and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of the Companys Common Stock
(subject to certain exceptions), each Company Option and each Company Warrant
being extinguished and converted into only the right to receive the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Company previously adopted the Anue Systems, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan
(the " _Company Option Plan_ ");

WHEREAS, the Company has previously granted to the Optionholder, pursuant to
the Company Option Plan and an Option Agreement (as defined below), one or
more stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company ("
_Company Options_ ") as listed on the _Schedule of Ownership_ attached hereto.
The Company Options listed on the _Schedule of Ownership_ attached hereto
constitute all Company Options held by the Optionholder;

WHEREAS, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another
corporation, or a Change in Control (as defined in the Company Option Plan),
Section 13 of the Company Option Plan provides that each outstanding Company
Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor
corporation or a parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation;

WHEREAS, a Company Option is considered assumed if, following the merger or
Change in Control, the Company Option confers the right to purchase or
receive, for each Share subject to the Company Option, the consideration
received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for
each Share held on the effective date of the transaction;

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, the Optionholder wishes to irrevocably
cancel such Company Options and convert such Company Options existing as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive, upon consummation of the Merger,
the consideration described below (the " _Merger Election_ ").

 

1\. _Cancellation of Company Options_. The Optionholder hereby acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees that: (a) the Company Options (whether or not vested
or exercisable) are hereby surrendered, cancelled and terminated, effective as
of the Effective Time; (b) the Company Option Plan will be terminated as of
the Effective Time; and (c) all of the Company Options will cease to exist
and will be automatically cancelled and retired and the Optionholder will
cease to have any rights or obligations with respect to the Company Options as
of the Effective Time, other than those set forth in  _Section 2_ of this
Agreement.

 

 2\. _Consideration_. In consideration of the surrender, cancellation
and termination of the Company Options and the waiver and releases set forth
in _Section 5_ and _Section 9_ below, and subject to consummation of the
Merger and the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the
Company hereby agrees to pay, with respect to each Company Option and subject
to the terms of, and at such times as set forth in, the Merger Agreement, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Exchange Amount over the
applicable exercise price of such Company Option by (ii) the number of shares
of Common Stock the Optionholder could have purchased (assuming full vesting
of such Company Option) had the Optionholder exercised such Company Option in
full immediately prior to the Effective Time, as more fully set forth on the
_Schedule of Ownership_ attached hereto (such aggregate amount for all Company
Options, the " _Optionholder Consideration_ "). The Optionholder
Consideration shall be payable without interest thereon and shall be subject
to any applicable withholding of Taxes and all adjustments made in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including any positive or negative
adjustments for purposes of the working capital adjustment, other adjustments
or indemnification claims. The Optionholder, to the greatest extent permitted
by law, hereby acknowledges that the payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be in full satisfaction of any and all rights the Optionholder may have
under the Company Option Plan, the Option Agreement(s) or otherwise with
respect to each and every Option granted to the Optionholder by the Company.
Each Option held by the Optionholder shall be deemed at any time after the
date the Optionholder executes and delivers this Agreement to the Company to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Optionholder
Consideration as provided in this Section 2\.

3\. _Appointment of the Representative_. The Optionholder acknowledges that
all payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement will be made as provided
in the Merger Agreement. The Optionholder agrees that the Optionholder will be
deemed a "Securityholder" under, and shall be subject to, the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof. The Optionholder hereby irrevocably
ratifies the appointment, authorization and empowerment of the Representative
as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Optionholder pursuant to
Section 1.16 of the Merger Agreement (including with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby). All authority
herein conferred or agreed to be conferred upon the Representative shall
survive the death or incapacity of the Optionholder, and any obligation of the
Optionholder hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal
representatives, estates, successors and assigns of the Optionholder.

 

4\. _Merger Agreement; Escrow Agreement_. The Optionholder acknowledges
receipt of a copy of the Merger Agreement (included herewith) and the Escrow
Agreement (included herewith). The Optionholder has reviewed those documents
and the terms of the Merger described therein. The Optionholder has also
reviewed such other materials as the Optionholder has deemed necessary
or appropriate for the purposes of this Agreement. The Optionholder
understands that the Escrow Amount will be retained in the Escrow Account to
satisfy, at least in part, any claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any
post-closing adjustment pursuant to Section 1.11 of the Merger Agreement,
(ii) any Parent Indemnified Person for any

 



2  indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to Section
8.2 of the Merger Agreement or (iii) any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to
the Merger Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. The Optionholder acknowledges and agrees to be subject
to and bound by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement substantially in the form included herewith, with such
changes as the officers of the Company may approve. The Optionholder further
acknowledges that the Optionholder Consideration is subject to certain
adjustments more specifically described in Section 1.4 to the Merger
Agreement.

5\. _Waiver_. As a condition precedent to the Optionholders right to receive
the Optionholder Consideration, the Optionholder hereby irrevocably waives
all requirements under the Company Options, the Option Agreement(s), the
Company Option Plan or any other separate agreement applicable to such Company
Options.

 

6\. _Exercise of Options; Termination of Option Agreements_. The Optionholder
agrees that (a) any Option Agreement previously entered into between the
Company and the Optionholder and (b) all outstanding and unexercised Company
Options will be terminated as of the Effective Time with no further liability
or obligation on the part of the Company or the Optionholder thereunder,
except as expressly provided herein.

7\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Optionholder represents and
warrants, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time
(except for representations and warranties that by their express terms only
address matters as of a particular date), as follows:

 

(a) _Authority_. The Optionholder has full power and authority to enter into
this Agreement, to perform his or her obligations thereunder, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement.
This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the

terms, except to the extent that enforceability hereof or thereof may be
limited by bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally and general equitable principles.

 

(b) _No Violation_. The Optionholder is not a party to, subject to or bound by
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, agreement, lien, contract
or other instrument or obligation or any statute, law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, injunction, or decree of any court, administrative or
regulatory body, governmental agency, arbitrator, mediator or similar body,
franchise or license, which would (i) conflict with or be breached or violated
or the obligations thereunder accelerated, increased, extinguished or
terminated (whether or not with notice or lapse of time or both) by
the execution, delivery or performance by the Optionholder of this Agreement
or (ii) prevent the carrying out of the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Merger Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby or thereby. No
permit, consent, waiver, approval or authorization of, or declaration to or
filing or registration with, any third person or Government is required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Optionholder of
this Agreement, or the consummation by the Optionholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement. The execution of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Optionholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement will not result in the
creation of any Liens against the Company or the Optionholder or any of the
properties or assets of any of them.

 



3 (c) _Options_. The Optionholder holds of record and owns beneficially the
number of Company Options set forth next to his or her name on the _Schedule
of Ownership_ hereto, free and clear of any Liens. Except as set forth on the

option, warrant, purchase right or other contract or commitment (other than
this Agreement or a Letter of Transmittal) that could require the Optionholder
to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any capital stock or other equity
interest of the Company. Except as set forth on the _Schedule of Ownership_
hereto, there are no Optionholder agreements, buy-sell agreements, voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Optionholder is a
party or to which he or she is bound relating to any shares of capital stock
or other equity interest in the Company into which the Company Options may be
converted.

(d) _Representation by Counsel_. The Optionholder: (a) has been represented by

counsel and has declined to do so); (b) has had the full right and
opportunity to consult with the Optionholders attorney and other advisors and
has availed himself or herself of this right and opportunity; (c) has

of the Optionholder, threatened against the Optionholder before any court
or arbitrator or any Government authority which challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement. As of the date hereof, to the
Optionholders knowledge, the Optionholder is not, and none of its properties
is, subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
award that would prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Optionholder understands and acknowledges that
Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the
Optionholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Optionholder has

such statement or communication or schedule any press conference or conference
call with respect to the Merger Agreement or this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the written consent
of Parent. Following the Closing, the Optionholder shall maintain in
confidence any information it may have in relation to Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Company and such information shall not be disclosed or used by
Optionholder without Parents prior written consent, unless such information
is (i) otherwise publicly available as of the date of this Agreement other
than as the result of an unauthorized disclosure or (ii) required to be
disclosed pursuant to applicable Law.

 



4 9\. _Release_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, the Optionholder hereby irrevocably waives,
releases and discharges Parent, the Company or, from and after the Closing,
the Surviving Company, and any of their respective Affiliates, and the owners
of each of the foregoing, and the directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, heirs, administrators, predecessors, attorneys,
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (the " _Releasees_ ") from any
and all liabilities and obligations to it of any kind or nature whatsoever, in
his or her capacity as a Optionholder, manager, member, officer, director or
employee of the Company or any other capacity, in each case whether absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, disclosed or
undisclosed, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding (other
than this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and any of the other agreements
executed and delivered in connection with the Merger Agreement) or otherwise
at law or equity, and the Optionholder agrees that he or she shall not seek to
recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from any of the
Releasees; provided, that the waivers contained in this _Section 9_ shall not
apply to (i) claims against Parent asserted pursuant to this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, (ii) any claims for which the facts or circumstances giving
rise to such claim first occur following Closing, or (iii) obligations
relating to the payment or provisions of wages, salaries, bonuses, benefits,
expense reimbursements and perquisites due to such Optionholders as an
employee, officer or director incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business and
accrued or payable at Closing (except for indemnification and insurance
provided to officers and directors by the Company as provided in Section 1.15
of the Merger Agreement). In furtherance of the foregoing, except as otherwise
provided in the Merger Agreement, the Optionholder hereby agrees that he or
she shall not make any claim for indemnification against any Releasee by
reason of the fact that the Optionholder is or was a Optionholder, member,
director, manager, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of their Affiliates (whether such
claim is for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in
settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant
to any statute, charter document, bylaw, agreement or otherwise) with respect
to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand brought against
the Optionholder, and the Optionholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that he
or she shall not have any claim or right to contribution or indemnity from any
Releasee with respect to any amounts paid by him or her pursuant to this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

(b) The Optionholder affirms that the matters covered by the preceding
paragraph includes, without limitation, (i) any claims under the securities or
other laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof, or any
foreign jurisdiction, relating to the Merger or the ownership of any of the
Company Options, (ii) any claims challenging or disputing the validity,
enforceability, binding effect or legality of the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) any claims for breach
of fiduciary duty arising from any actions or inactions at or prior to the
Closing Date, including, without limitation, related to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



5 (c) The Optionholder agrees that nothing in this release is an admission
by either the Optionholder or any Releasee of any wrongdoing, either in
violation of an applicable law or otherwise, and that nothing in this
Agreement is to be construed as such by any Person. The Optionholder further
acknowledges that he or she understands this release, the claims he or she is
releasing, the promises and agreements he or she is making, and the effect of
his or her signing this Agreement.

 

(d) The Optionholder hereby waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law
which, if applied to this release, would exclude from its binding effect any
claim against the Releasees not now known by the Optionholder to exist. This
release is intended to be a general release and a covenant not to sue that
extinguishes all claims released above and precludes any attempt by the
Optionholder to initiate any litigation against the Releasees with respect to
the claims released above. If the Optionholder commences or continues any
claim in violation of this release, the Releasees shall be entitled to assert
this release as a complete bar. This release is binding on the Optionholder
and his or her respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and
assigns, in their own right, and in the rights of others.

 

(e) Solely with respect to the claims released hereunder, the Optionholder
expressly waives and relinquishes to the fullest extent permitted by law (and
to the extent applicable), the provisions, rights, and benefits of Section
1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides:

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor."

(f) The Optionholder hereby acknowledges that he or she has been advised to
consult with an attorney before executing this Agreement and otherwise in
connection with the Merger and all actions contemplated by the Merger and the
Merger Agreement and the related documents and that the Optionholder has done
so or, after careful reading and consideration has chosen not to do so of the
Optionholders own volition. The Optionholder hereby acknowledges that he or
she has signed this release knowingly and voluntarily and with the advice of
any counsel retained to advise the Optionholder with respect to this release.

10\. _Indemnification_. Article 8 of the Merger Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by this reference. By virtue of such incorporation by
reference, the parties hereto shall be entitled to all of the benefits, and
subject to all of the obligations, contained in such Article.

 

11\. _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement shall be
terminated without further action required by any party in the event that the
Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 9 of the Merger
Agreement; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any
party from any liability for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of
this Agreement prior to the termination. Following Closing, this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the death or incapacity
of the Optionholder, and shall be binding upon the heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of the Optionholder.

 



6 12\. _Further Actions_. The Optionholder will, upon request, execute and
deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed appropriate or necessary
by the Company in connection with the surrender of the certificates that
formerly represented the Company Options. From and after the Closing, the
Optionholder shall do such acts and execute such documents and instruments as
may be reasonably required to make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Merger Agreement.

13\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

(a) _Assignment_. This Agreement and the various rights and obligations
arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties and their respective successors, heirs, devisees, legatees, legal
representatives and permitted assigns (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise). Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, delegated, or assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) by
the Optionholder.

(b) _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature(s).

 

(c) _Headings; Interpretation_. The Section headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each party agrees that any
ambiguity herein should not be construed against the draftsman. Whenever
required by the context, any gender shall include any other gender, the
singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular.

(d) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative and
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law.

 

(e) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in
accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware, without reference to its choice of law rules.

(f) _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by a
party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in
the federal or state courts located in the State of Delaware, County of New
Castle or the federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the non-exclusive

 



7  jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim, or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this

jurisdiction of the above named court for any reason other than the failure to
serve process in accordance with this  _Section 13(f)_, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such court (whether through judgment or otherwise),
and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
court. Each party hereto waives all personal service of any and all process
upon such party related to this Agreement and consents that all service of
process upon such party shall be made by hand delivery, certified mail or
confirmed telecopy directed to such party at the address specified in this
Agreement; and service made by certified mail shall be complete seven days
after the same shall have been posted.

 

(g) _No Waiver_. Any failure by any of the parties hereto to comply with any
of the obligations, agreements or conditions set forth herein may be waived
by all of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that any such waiver
shall not be deemed a waiver of any other obligation, agreement or condition.

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any

 _Company Options_ Exhibit H

EXECUTION COPY

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT 

This NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of May 4, 2012 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Ixia, a
California corporation ("Ixia"), and ("Stockholder"), a resident
of the State of Texas and a stockholder of Anue Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

RECITALS 

A. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Ixia is
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Ixia, Emily
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Ixia
("Acquisition Subsidiary"), the Company and Alexander Pepe, as the initial
Representative (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other
things, Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary
of Ixia. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement.

B. Stockholder is a stockholder of the Company, and in connection with the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, a portion of
the Merger Consideration will be paid to Stockholder. Stockholder also has a
direct or indirect beneficial or other financial interest in the shares of
common stock of the Company listed in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and
incorporated herein and, as a result of such interest, will benefit, directly
or indirectly, from the Merger Consideration to be paid to the stockholders
of the Company holding such shares (as such stockholders are listed in
_Exhibit A_).

C. The Merger Agreement requires that this Agreement be executed and delivered
by Stockholder as a condition to the obligations of Ixia under the Merger
Agreement.

 

D. The Company is engaged in the business of (i) designing, developing,
researching, manufacturing, supplying, distributing, selling and supporting
(A) network monitoring switches and (B) products and systems that emulate
networks or monitor or validate the performance of synchronization services,
Ethernet operations administration and maintenance (i.e OAM), and protection
switching, and (ii) providing related services (the "Business").

E. The Company has customers throughout the world, and competes globally with
firms providing products, solutions and services similar or comparable to, and
competitive with, those of the Company.

 

F. The Company has expended a great deal of time, money and effort to develop
and maintain proprietary, trade secret, and other confidential business
information relating to the Business which, if misused or disclosed, could be
very harmful to the Company. Stockholder recognizes that, as a result of
Stockholders affiliation with the Company, Stockholder may have had and will
be provided and have access to (among other things) the Companys proprietary,
trade secret and other confidential information of or relating to the
Companys business. G. Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that the Company, in all fairness,
needs certain protection in order (among other things) (i) to ensure that
Stockholder does not misappropriate or misuse any proprietary, trade secret or
other confidential information relating to the Companys business, cause
injury to the Companys customer relationships, or take any other action
which could result in a loss of goodwill developed for and on behalf of the
Company and at its expense, and (ii) more generally, to prevent Stockholder
from being positioned to provide others with an unfair competitive advantage
over the Company.

H. Stockholder has occupied a position of trust and confidence with the
Company prior to the date hereof and has had access to and has become familiar
with the Companys confidential information.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the covenants,
representations, warranties, conditions and agreement hereinafter expressed,
the parties agree as follows:

 

1\. _Acknowledgements_.

(a) Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that he has occupied a position of
trust and confidence with the Company prior to the date hereof and has had
access to and has become familiar with the confidential information of the
Company.

(b) Stockholder recognizes that the covenants set forth in _Section 2_
of this Agreement are an essential part of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and that but for the agreement of Stockholder to comply
with such covenants, Ixia and Acquisition Subsidiary would not enter into the
Merger Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set
forth in _Section 2_ of this Agreement are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of the Company being acquired by Ixia pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, including without limitation, trade secrets and
other confidential information of the Company and goodwill acquired pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, and that irreparable harm and damage will be done to
Ixia if Stockholder takes any action in any way prohibited by such covenants.
In addition, Stockholder acknowledges that the Merger Consideration is paid in
part as consideration for customer contacts and marketplace reputation
developed by Stockholder for the Company, and that such covenants
are necessary for Ixia to receive the full benefit of the Merger Agreement.

(c) Stockholder hereby acknowledges the broad territorial scope of the
covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement, and acknowledges and
agrees that such covenants and restrictions are reasonable in view of, among
other things, (i) the narrow range of activities prohibited; (ii) the fact
that the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing is international in
scope; (iii) the fact that the Business prior to the Closing competes with
other businesses that are or could be located in any part of the world; (iv)
the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Company to
which Stockholder had and/or may have had access; (v) the fact that a business
which competes with the Business could greatly benefit if it were to
obtain the confidential information of the Company; (vi) the sale and/or
transfer of the intellectual property and goodwill of the Company pursuant to
the Merger Agreement; (vii) the fact that Stockholder would have an unfair
competitive advantage if he were allowed to engage  in the competitive activities prohibited by this Agreement in light of the
confidential, proprietary and trade secret information and/or goodwill that
Stockholder had as of the Closing, (viii) the fact that Ixia has required
Stockholder to make the covenants set forth in _Section 2_ of this Agreement
as a condition to consummating the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (ix) the fact that the provisions of _Section 2_ of this
Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve Ixias
interests in and right to use and operate the Business from and after Closing;
and (x) Ixia would be irreparably damaged if Stockholder were to breach the
covenants set forth in _Section 2_ of this Agreement.

2\. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_. In consideration of the Merger
Consideration and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Stockholder agrees that he shall not:

 

(a) for a period of four (4) years after the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), directly himself or indirectly through or on behalf of any entity,
as a principal, employee, partner, stockholder, member, officer, director,
agent or otherwise, compete with, assist in or provide financial resources to
any activity, person or entity which competes anywhere in the world with the
Business, whether conducted by the Company, Ixia and/or any of their
respective subsidiaries, as the Business is conducted or planned to be
conducted on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit Stockholder from owning 2% or less of the outstanding equity or debt
securities of a publicly traded entity that engages in the Business (or any
portion thereof) or from performing services as an employee for the benefit of
the Company, Ixia and/or any of their respective subsidiaries and accordance
with the terms and conditions of such employment;

(b) use or disclose to anyone except authorized personnel of the Company and
Ixia any trade secrets or confidential matters concerning the Company,
including, without limitation, all information pertaining to secrets, customer
lists and credit records, employee data, sales representatives and their
territories, mailing lists, consultant arrangements, pricing policies,
operational methods, marketing plans or strategies, product development and
techniques or plans, research and development programs and plans, business
acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans, designs and design
projects, intellectual property and any other research or business information
concerning the Company which the Company currently treats as confidential
(whether or not a trade secret under applicable law). If Stockholder is or
may be obligated to disclose any such trade secret or confidential information
pursuant to applicable law, regulation or legal process, then Stockholder
shall provide Ixia with prompt written notice before any such disclosure
sufficient to enable Ixia either to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section or both. Nothing herein shall
prevent Stockholder from using or disclosing information that is generally
available to the public;

(c) during the Restrictive Period, directly himself or indirectly through or
on behalf of any entity, as a principal, employee, partner, stockholder,
member, officer, director, agent or otherwise, solicit or encourage to leave
employment any officer or employee of the Company, Ixia or any of their
respective subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, or any person who had been an
officer or employee of the Company, Ixia or any of their respective
subsidiaries   within the three months immediately preceding the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Restricted Employees"), or induce or attempt to induce, or
assist anyone else to induce or attempt to induce, any customer of the
Company, Ixia or any of their respective subsidiaries to reduce or discontinue
its business with the Company, Ixia or any of their respective subsidiaries or
disclose to anyone else the name and/or requirements of any such customer or
provide goods or services to any such customer in competition with the goods
or services of the Company, Ixia or any of their respective subsidiaries; or

 

(d) for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, directly himself
or indirectly through or on behalf of any entity, as a principal, employee,
partner, stockholder, member, officer, director, agent or otherwise, hire any
one or more of the Restricted Employees; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the restrictions set forth
in Section 2(c) above, from and after the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, Stockholder shall not be prohibited from hiring any one or more of the
Restricted Employees who are listed in _Exhibit B_ attached hereto.

 

3\. _Remedies_. If Stockholder breaches the covenants set forth in _Section
2_ of this Agreement, Ixia will be entitled to the following remedies:

(a) money damages (if any) from Stockholder; and

 

(b) injunctive or equitable relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach
or otherwise to specifically enforce the provisions of  _Section 2_ of this
Agreement, it being agreed that money damages alone would be inadequate to
compensate Ixia and would be an inadequate remedy for such breach.

4\. _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law.
Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out
of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by
a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by
the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement. 5\. _Notice_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by facsimile

attorneys fees) incurred in the pursuit or defense of such action.

provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing

and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative and without
prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law.

submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the county in
