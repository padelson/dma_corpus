Adjustment Amount that is a positive number, (i) Acquiror and the Seller shall
immediately deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller an amount in cash equal to the

and personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing

Amount and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses, it shall notify
Acquiror of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of such disagreement, within seventy-five (75) calendar days
after its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement. In the event that the Seller
does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such seventy-five (75)
day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Post-Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the
Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the
Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses delivered by Acquiror, which shall
be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and the Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect
to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve such disagreements, then BDO USA, LLP (or such other independent
accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may
be mutually selected by Acquiror and the Seller) (the "Independent
Accountant") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. Each of Acquiror and
the Seller shall promptly provide their assertions regarding the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date
Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and, to the
extent relevant thereto, the Post-Closing Statement, in writing to the
Independent Accountant and to each other. The Independent Accountant shall be
instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements (and
provide in reasonable detail the basis for each such determination) as soon as
reasonably practicable (which the parties hereto agree should not be later
than forty-five (45) days following the day on which the disagreement is
referred to the Independent Accountant). The Independent Accountant shall base
its determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and
shall not conduct an independent investigation and (ii)

the extent (if any) to which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses require adjustment (only with respect to the
remaining disagreements submitted to the Independent Accountant) in order to
be determined in accordance with Section 3.3(a) (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in Section 3.3(a)), and, with respect to each disputed
item, the Independent Accountant's determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either Acquiror or the Seller, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts presented in Acquiror's
calculation of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or in the
Seller's written notice of disagreement of such calculation pursuant to this
Section 3.3(b). The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties and no party shall seek further
recourse to any Governmental Authority other than to enforce the determination
of the Independent Accountant. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 3.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement. If Acquiror fails promptly to pay
any Adjustment Amount that may be payable to the Holders in accordance with
this Section 3.3, or if either party fails to give the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section 3.3 and, in
order to obtain such payment or delivery of the joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent, a party commences an Action that results in a judgment
against the other party for such Adjustment Amount or for the delivery of the
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, the losing party shall pay to
the prevailing party (or deliver the joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing it to pay), together with such Adjustment Amount, in
accordance with Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(d), interest on such Adjustment
Amount from the date Acquiror delivers to the Seller its calculation of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the
Closing Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses at
a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date hereof. In addition the
prevailing party shall be entitled to any fees, costs and expenses (including
legal fees) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with any such
Action. The date on which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses are finally determined in accordance with this
Section 3.3(b) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date". All
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Independent Accountant hereunder shall be borne one-
half (50%) by Acquiror, on the one hand, and one-half (50%) by the Seller, on
the other hand.

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price
shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value
of the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance
with Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(d).

(d) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay a portion of the Purchase Price
equal to the Escrow Amount to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as

Agent to pay to the Seller an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment Escrow
Funds less any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Funds previously paid by the

Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such amount, the "Deficit
Amount"), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (x) Acquiror and the
Seller shall immediately deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Acquiror an amount of Adjustment Escrow
Funds, and if such Adjustment Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy the
Deficit Amount, from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, equal to the Deficit
Amount (subject to the last sentence of this Section 3.3(d)), and (y) if any
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after such payment to Acquiror, the

shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow Funds (and, if applicable

Section 3.4 Outstanding Company Expenses. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to Acquiror a written report setting forth a list of the
following fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, solely to the extent such fees and expenses are incurred
through the Closing and unpaid as of 11:59 p.m. Illinois time on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, whether accrued for or not: (a) the
fees and disbursements of outside counsel to the Company incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) the fees
and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants and experts employed
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (c) the Change in Control
Payments, if any, and (d) the premium and associated fees in connection with
the "tail" policy providing directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage pursuant to Section 7.2(b) (the fees and expenses in the foregoing
clauses (a) through (d), collectively, the "Outstanding Company Expenses");
provided that to the extent such payments are (i) amounts owed to an employee
as compensation for services, such amounts shall be deposited in the Company's
or applicable Company Subsidiary's payroll account and Acquiror shall cause
the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary to pay such amounts to the

Subsidiary and Acquiror shall cause the Company or applicable Company
Subsidiary to timely remit such amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority. Immediately prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall pay to such third-
parties as are directed by the Seller with written evidence of the total
amount due such third party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
an amount equal to the Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be
included on the Post-Closing Statement, the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital or the Closing Date Net Working Capital, in each case, with respect to
liabilities for the Outstanding Company Expenses paid in accordance with this
Section 3.4. For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts payable in connection with
the repayment of the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount shall be included in the
Outstanding Company Expenses.



Section 3.5 Repayment of Funded Debt. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Acquiror a payoff letter from the administrative agent (in the
case of the Credit Documents) and the holders of Holder Loan Documents (and
any other indebtedness for borrowed money to banks or financial institutions,
if any), which payoff letter shall state the amount of the applicable Funded
Debt owed to such lender and that, if such amount is paid to such lender on
the Closing Date (or thereafter, if any applicable per diem amounts are paid),
such lender will release any and all Liens that it may have with respect to
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their assets. At the Closing, the
Acquiror shall pay in full (on behalf of the Company), or shall cause the
Company to pay in full (and shall provide sufficient funds to the Company to
enable it to make such payments), an amount equal to the Funded Debt as set
forth in such payoff letters for the Closing Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in the amounts and to the lenders identified such
payoff letters. For the avoidance of doubt, though included in the calculation
of Funded Debt, Capitalized Leases shall not be subject to this Section 3.5
(it being understood and agreed that Capitalized Leases shall remain
outstanding as of immediately after the Closing).



Section 3.6 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, any consideration payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be reduced by any Tax withholding required by Law,
and any amount so withheld in compliance with applicable Law will be treated
for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Person with respect to
which the withholding was made. Any Person that expects to so withhold (or
expects its agent to so withhold) any such Tax (other than any such Tax that
is imposed on consideration that is properly treated as compensation for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes) will provide notice of the expected withholding
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the withholding to the Person with
respect to which the withholding is to be made (and the notice will include
the legal authority and the calculation method for the expected withholding),
and the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to cooperate to minimize
the amount of the withholding.



Section 3.7 RWI Policy. Acquiror shall pay the premium and all other costs
required for issuance of the RWI Policy at Closing. The RWI Policy shall
include a provision whereby insurer expressly waives, and agrees not to
pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Seller or
any Holder with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder (except
for intentional fraud in connection with the transaction by that Holder or
Seller).

Section 3.8 Specified Customer Excess Amount. On the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall pay a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the Specified Customer
Excess Amount to the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow. The Specified
Customer Excess Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Unless prior to any such
Quarterly Payment Date a Specified Customer Termination Event has occurred and
written notice thereof has been delivered by Acquiror to the Seller, on each
Quarterly Payment Date, an amount equal to the product of (a) 0.125 multiplied
by (b) the Specified Customer Excess Amount shall be released by the Escrow
Agent to the Seller; provided that on the final Quarterly Payment Date, the
amount payable to Seller shall instead be the then remaining Specified
Customer Excess Funds If a Specified Customer Termination Event has occurred,
Acquiror and the Seller shall, after Seller's receipt of the written notice
contemplated by the immediately foregoing sentence, deliver joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Acquiror the then remaining Specified Customer Escrow Funds. The Acquiror
shall not, and shall cause the Company, not to amend or modify the Company's
contract with the Specified Customer in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Seller's rights under this Section 3.8 without
the Seller's prior written consent. At any time prior to release of the entire
Specified Customer Excess Amount from the Specified Customer Escrow Funds that
the consumption by the Company of the Specified Customer Inventory Amount is
materially more than or materially less than 12.5% of the original Specified
Customer Excess Amount per quarter, the Acquiror and the Seller shall, upon
the request of either such party, negotiate in good faith changes to the
timing and payment of the Specified Customer Excess Amount to reflect the
timing of payments from the Specified Customer.

disposition thereof.

assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the

investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Action, (ii) preparing reports to stockholders
and Governmental Authorities or (iii) such other purposes for which access to
such documents is believed by the Seller to be reasonably necessary, including
preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided for under

records, documents and employees will not materially interfere with the normal
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries incurred in
connection therewith will be paid by the Seller. Acquiror will cause the
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve all such
books, records and other documents for any applicable statutory or regulatory
retention period, as the same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer
to transfer such records to the Seller at the end of any such period.

Closing S Corporation Return in the form prepared by the Seller (subject to
making changes prior to filing in accordance with Section 8.3(c)). Seller
shall be solely responsible for filing the IRS Form 1120S (and comparable
state and local firms and related information returns such as the IRS Form K-1
for each shareholder of the Company) of the Seller, including to the extent it
reflects the operations of the Company prior to the Closing Date.



(c) Acquiror shall consider in good faith, and the Seller shall consider in
good faith, any timely comments made by the other party to any Tax Return
prepared under Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(b) or an amendment to a Pre-
Closing Tax Return under Section 8.3(g). The Seller and Acquiror shall work in
good faith to resolve any disagreements relating to any Tax Return of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for a period Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including a Straddle Tax Period) that is to be filed following the Closing
Date. In the event that the parties cannot resolve their disagreement, the
matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant to resolve in
accordance with the principles provided for in Section 3.3, provided that if
such disagreement is not resolved by the Independent Accountant or otherwise
prior to the due date of such Tax Return (after taking into account applicable
extensions), the Acquiror shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) the
Tax Return as prepared under Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) (subject to
whatever changes as agreed by the Seller and Acquiror prior to filing) and
once the disagreement is resolved, the Acquiror shall file, or cause to be
filed, an amendment to such Tax Return as necessary to reflect the final
determination by the Independent Accountant or otherwise. To the extent that
any such amendment shows a refund of a Tax that was paid out of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, the Acquiror shall promptly return such amount
to the Escrow Agent to be held under the Escrow Agreement (or, if the Escrow
Agreement has been terminated, to the Seller for distribution to the Escrow
Agent) and to the extent that any such amendment shows a Tax for which the
Acquiror Indemnified Party is to be indemnified under Section 11.2(a), such
amount shall be remitted to the Acquiror in accordance with Article XI and
other applicable agreements.



(d) The Seller and Acquiror agree (A) for all Tax purposes that (i) the F
Reorganization shall be treated as an "reorganization" under Section
368(a)(1)(F) and the Seller shall succeed to the Company's election as an S
corporation; (ii) the acquisition of the Shares of the Company shall be
treated as an acquisition by the Acquiror, and a sale by the Seller, of all of
the Company's assets for the applicable purchase price; and (iii) any income
Tax deductions associated with the Outstanding Company Expenses or the
repayment of the Funded Debt that accrue or are paid on or prior to the
Closing Date shall be claimed on the income Tax Returns of the Seller
including the Closing Date; and (B) to prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistently with the agreements set forth in clause (A) (except as otherwise
required by Law).

(e) Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Seller, Company or any Company
Subsidiary for a period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle
Tax Period and the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention of and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to the Tax matters and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide the additional
information.



(f) Acquiror shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by any
Acquiror Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of any written notice
from any Governmental Authority of an Action with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that could give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a) or that relates to a Pre-
Closing S Corporation Return (collectively, a "Tax Contest Claim"). Such
notice shall include a copy of any correspondence and any other written
material receiving from the applicable Governmental Authority. Acquiror and
the Seller shall in accordance with Section 8.3(e) cooperate with each other
in the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim and, as necessary or requested, provide
(or cause the applicable Acquiror Indemnified Party to provide) any power of
attorneys with respect to such Tax Contest Claim. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Seller shall have the right to control any
Tax Contest Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or
Company Subsidiary which could result in a Tax that is subject to
indemnification under Section 11.2(a) or that relates to any Pre-Closing S
Corporation Return (any such claim, a "Seller's Tax Contest Claim"); provided
that if the resolution or settlement of such Seller's Tax Contest Claim could
have an adverse effect on any Acquiror Indemnified Party in a Post-Closing Tax
Period, (i) the Seller shall keep the Acquiror informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Seller's Tax Contest Claim; (ii) Acquiror
shall be entitled at its expense to participate in such Seller's Tax Contest
Claim; and (iii) the Seller shall not compromise or settle any such Seller's
Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Acquiror's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Acquiror shall
control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim that the Seller does not have the
right to control, or has not yet elected to control; provided that (x)
Acquiror shall keep the Seller informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Tax Contest Claim; (y) the Seller shall be entitled at its
expense to participate in such Tax Contest Claim; and (z) the Acquiror shall
not, and shall not allow the Acquiror Indemnified Party, to settle any such
Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Seller's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Seller
shall be solely responsible for contesting an Action with respect to Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Seller, including those that relate to operations of the
Company.



(g) After the Closing Date, except as required by Law or with the prior
written consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), Acquiror shall not, and shall not cause or allow any other Acquiror
Indemnified Person, to take any of the following actions with respect to a Tax
Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that relates to a period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Period: (i) file an
amended Tax Return; (ii) make or change any Tax election; (iii) adopt or
change any Tax accounting method; (iv) change any Tax accounting period; (v)
agree to extend any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or that relates to a Pre-Closing S

Corporation Return; (vi) initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to any
Tax matter; or (vii) take any similar action relating to Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as contemplated by Section
8.3(m), Acquiror shall not, and shall not allow any Acquiror Indemnified
Person to make any election under Code Sections 336 or 338 (or similar
provisions of state or local or non-U.S. laws) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing Date, if the
Seller requests that an amendment to a Pre-Closing Tax Return be filed, Seller
shall deliver to the Acquiror such amendment at least (20) days prior to the
intended filing date for Acquiror's review and filing pursuant to Section
8.3(c).



(h) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each party hereto agrees,
and to cause each of its Affiliates, to elect for all relevant Tax purposes to
end the fiscal year of the Company as of the Closing Date. The amount of any
Income Tax or other Tax that is not a property or similar ad valorem Tax for
any Straddle Tax Period that is apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of
such Straddle Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of any
property taxes or similar ad valorem Tax or franchise Tax for a Straddle Tax
Period that is apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax
Period shall equal the amount of the Tax for the entire Straddle Tax Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on or before the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the days in the entire period.



(i) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the Adjustment
Amount, the Acquiror shall provide to the Seller a schedule allocating the
purchase price paid by the Acquiror for U.S. Federal income taxes for the
assets of the Company (and, to the extent disregarded, each Company
Subsidiary) among the assets of the Company (and, to the extent disregarded,
each Company Subsidiary) (the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule"). The
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with
Schedule 8.3(i). If within thirty (30) days of receiving the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, the Seller has not objected, the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding. If the Seller objects within
the thirty (30) days, the Seller and Acquiror shall work in good faith to
resolve their differences; provided that if after the Seller and Acquiror are
unable to resolve their differences within twenty (20) days of the dispute,
the Independent Accountant shall be retained to resolve the dispute. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of the Code and Schedule 8.3(i) and, absent manifest error,
shall be final and binding. The costs of the Independent Accountant shall be
shared equally by the Seller and Acquiror. Unless otherwise required by a
determination of a Governmental Authority that is final, the Acquiror shall
for all Tax purposes, and cause the Company and all of its other Affiliates
for all Tax purposes, to allocate the purchase price paid for the assets of
the Company among the assets of the Company consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule as finalized and the Seller shall allocate its sales
price for the Company's assets consistently with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule as finalized.



(j) If the aggregate amount allocated to the property, plant, and/or equipment
of the Company exceeds $30,000,000 (as determined under Section 8.3(i)) the
Acquiror shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of such
excess (the "Additional Purchase

| 

 



Price"). If payable, the Additional Purchase Price shall be paid in cash
within ten (10) days of the finalization of the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule.



(k) All refunds of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (whether in the form of cash received or a credit or offset
against Taxes payable) to the extent not reflected in the Closing Net Working
Capital (as finally determined) shall be for the benefit of the Seller. To the
extent that the Acquiror or the Company or any Company Subsidiary receives a
refund after the Closing Date that is for the benefit of the Seller, the
Acquiror shall pay such amount to the Escrow Agent be added to Indemnification
Escrow Fund or if the Escrow Agreement has terminated, to the Seller. The
amount due shall be paid within ten (10) days of receiving the refund from the
Governmental Authority (or, in the case of a credit or offset, ten (10) days
after filing the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset).



(l) Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties agree to treat for all
Tax purposes all indemnification payments under Article XI or payments with
respect to refunds under this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase
Price and shall make appropriate adjustments to the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule to reflect those adjustments.



(m) If requested by the Acquiror, the Seller shall join with the Acquiror in
timely making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
analogous provision of state or local law) with respect to the Acquiror's
acquisition of the Shares of the Company from the Seller pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement (collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Acquiror
and Seller agree that the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election is purely
protective to ensure that if for some unforeseeable reason it is determined by
the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authority that the
Company and the Seller are both classified as C corporations and such election
shall have no effect unless such determination is made. If a Section
338(h)(10) Election is made, the Acquiror shall be solely responsible for
preparing all relevant forms (including the IRS Form 8023) (collectively, the
"Section 338 Forms") in the manner it reasonably determines in accordance with
this Section 8.3(m) and Seller shall be solely responsible for the timely
filing of any Section 338 Form with the Internal Revenue Service or other
taxing authority; provided, that (i) if requested or required, the Seller
shall properly and timely complete the portion of any Section 338 Form with
respect to information that solely relates to the Seller or the Company; (ii)
unless otherwise requested by the Seller, each Section 338 Form shall include
a disclaimer regarding the protective nature of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election and that it is only being made if for some unforeseen reason the
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority determines that the Seller
and Company are both C corporations as of the Closing; and (iii) if requested
or required, the Seller shall properly execute any Section 338 Form and timely
return such form to the Seller. The Acquiror and Seller agree that (except for
any disclaimer language added) all Section 338 Forms shall be prepared under
the assumption that both the Seller and the Company are C corporations that
are affiliated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties agree that
the Acquiror and Seller shall each file an IRS form 8594 with respect to the
allocation of the purchase price among the assets of the Company (in
accordance with the agreements set forth in Section 8.3(i)) and any allocation
resulting from an effective Section 338(h)(10) Election shall be consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and any IRS Form 8594 filed with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. If a Section 338(h)(10)
Election is made, the Acquiror shall promptly

following filing of any Section 338 Form, or at the written request of Seller,
provide to the Seller copies of the filed Section 338 Form.

ARTICLE XI

INDEMNIFICATION



Section 11.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each
representation warranty, covenant and obligation contained herein and any
certificate related to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation will survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for
fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date (such date, the "Survival Expiration
Date"); provided, however, that any covenant contained in this Agreement that,
by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing Date shall
survive until such covenant is performed. No Indemnification Claim may be
asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless (i) on or before the Survival
Expiration Date, such claim is asserted by proper written notice in accordance
with this Article XI, specifying, in reasonable detail, the basis of the claim
and (ii) such claim is made in respect of Damages specified, in reasonable
detail, and incurred prior to the Survival Expiration Date or, to the extent
arising out of an Indemnification Claim asserted in writing prior to the
Survival Expiration Date, such Indemnification Claim is made in respect of a
reasonably estimated amount of Damages reasonably expected to arise in
connection with such claim. No Indemnification Claim arising from a claim (or
an expected claim) by a third-party may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement
unless such third-party has actually commenced an action and, if the third-
party claim is with respect to Taxes, the Indemnified Party has received a
written notice of assessment or written notice of deficiency, in each case,
with respect to the specific matters of such Indemnification Claim.



Section 11.2 Indemnification.

| | 

|

55

| 

 



(a)Subject to Section 11.4, from and after the Closing Date, Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Acquiror Indemnified Parties") shall be
entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Funds for
any and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty the Company has made in Article IV, (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance
by the Company, the Holders or the Seller prior to or at the Closing or by the
Seller after the Closing, (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes (except to the extent
amounts with respect to such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation
of the Closing Date Net Working Capital), or (iv) the Specified Reimbursement
Obligations.

(b)Subject to Section 11.4, from and after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and the Holders harmless for any and all
Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty Acquiror has made in Article V, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Acquiror prior
to or at the Closing or by Acquiror or the Company after the Closing or (iii)
any Transfer Taxes.



(c)The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XI shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.



Section 11.3 Indemnification Claim Procedures.



(a) Upon receipt of any notice of an Action that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give or cause to be given such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) prior to the Survival Expiration Date.



(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and
each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of
such defense by the Indemnitor (including the


 

--- 
| | 

|

56

| 

 



making of any related claims, counterclaim or cross complaint against any
Person in connection with the Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by
the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not agree to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect
to such Action without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such
settlement provide for a complete release of the claims that are the subject
of such Action in favor of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party
gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does
not thereafter promptly assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may
conduct the defense of such Action; provided, however, that (A) the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (B) the Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time
the defense of such Action. To the extent the defense of any Action subject to
any Indemnification Claim is assumed by the Seller as the Indemnitor, at the
election of the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such defense of, and any
payment in respect of, any Action, including any settlement thereof, shall be
paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds and Acquiror and the Seller shall
promptly submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds as
is reasonably requested in writing by the Seller to pay such costs and
expenses or other amounts; provided, however, that no amounts will be payable
from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, unless the Indemnified Party is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(c) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.



Section 11.4 Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this Article XI will be limited as follows:

(a) Indemnification Cap. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XI will, subject to the immediately following sentence, not
exceed $1,750,000. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.2(a)(iv) will not exceed the lesser of (A) the Indemnification Escrow Funds
and (B) an amount equal in the aggregate to $300,000. The Indemnification
Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow shall serve as the sole and exclusive
source of payment of any Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i)
or Section 11.2(a)(iv).



(b) Claims Basket. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of
all Damages incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for which the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for breaches of Fundamental


 

---

|

| 

 



Representations) exceeds $1,750,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and once the
aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount, the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages
to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. The Basket Amount shall
not apply to any indemnification claims under Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section
11.2(a)(iii) or Section 11.2(a)(iv), or for claims for breaches of Fundamental
Representations under Section 11.2(a)(i).



(c) Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries. All
Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds (but not including any possible recovery under the RWI
Policy), indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which
any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Damages incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
may be entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-
party recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving
rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are obtained, received or
realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant
Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification
payment.



(d) Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Article XI, at the election of the
Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.



(e) Calculation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or an
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining
the amount of Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in
any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", or "in all material respects" or any similar term
or phrase will be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that
for the purposes of determining liability under this Article XI, the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will
be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) the term "Material Permit"
or when used as an adjective in any definition set forth in Section 1.1 and
(ii) any representation or warranty set forth in (A) the last sentence of
Section 4.7; (B) Sections 4.11(a)(viii), (xiii) and (xvi); (C) the first
sentence of Section 4.12(a); (D) Section 4.18(f); (E) Section 4.19(a); (F) the
first sentence of Section 4.21(a); (G) Section 4.21(f); (H) the first sentence
of Section 4.22; and (I) the second sentence of Section 4.23.

(f) Damages Reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or Included in Purchase
Price. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for
any

| | 

|

58

| 

 



Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved for
on the Post-Closing Statement or (ii) in respect of any liability included in
the calculation of the Purchase Price.



(g) No Duplicate Claims. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified Party or the
Seller, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an Indemnification
Claim, no other Acquiror Indemnified Party or the Seller, as applicable, may
recover the same Damages in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.

(h) Limitations on Tax Indemnification. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified for the following Taxes (or related Damages): (i) any Tax with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than such Taxes arising from a
breach of a representation in Section 4.14(l)); (ii) any Tax attributable to a
breach of the Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) of any provision of this Agreement; (iii) any Transfer Tax; or
(iv) any Tax to the extent included in the computation of the Purchase Price.



Section 11.5 Mitigation of Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI.



Section 11.6 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except for
intentional fraud, claims under this Article XI shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Funds shall be the sole source of recovery of the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties. The parties recognize that any further recovery for breaches of
representations and warranties under this Agreement by the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be under the RWI Policy (subject to the terms and
conditions thereof). In furtherance of the foregoing, Acquiror and each of the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against any indemnifying party relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or successor
liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or otherwise. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in
nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this
Article XI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:



(a) each of Acquiror hereby waives any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);



(b) after the Closing Date, none of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



(c) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article XI
were specifically bargained for between the parties hereto and were taken into
account by the parties hereto in arriving at the Purchase Price;


 

--- 
| | 

|

59

| 

 



(d) the parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement;



(e) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereto
hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action
(whether in contract or in tort) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement;



(f) the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arm's-length negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that
no party hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm's-length transaction; and



(g) for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this Section 11.6 and shall not be limited by the terms of this Section 11.6.



Section 11.7 Release of Escrow. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the
Indemnification Escrow Funds (if any) shall be released to the Seller on the
first Business Day following the Survival Expiration Date; provided, however,
that, if any Indemnification Claim shall have been properly asserted by any
Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to
the Survival Expiration Date and remains pending on the Survival Expiration
Date (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds
released to the Seller shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds
then held by the Escrow Agent, minus the aggregate amount of such Pending
Claim and (ii) any funds that remain in escrow following the Survival
Expiration Date in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to the
Seller promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such
Pending Claim. In each case in which this Section 11.7 provides for the
release of Indemnification Escrow Funds, each of Acquiror and the Seller shall
promptly submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with
this Section 11.7 and the Escrow Agreement.

heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions

|

64

| 

 



JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.



Section 12.14 Enforcement. Each Party agrees that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties would have entered
into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Each
Party acknowledges and agrees that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.14 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 12.14 and
concurrently pursue the payment of any damages under Section 10.2, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing (and the payment of
any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by or on behalf
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection
with the Company's pursuance of such grant of specific performance, which
Acquiror shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company (such payment shall be
deemed to have been made prior to 11:59 p.m. Illinois time on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) if the Company is actually granted
specific performance in accordance with this Section 12.14) and (B) damages
under Section 10.2.



Section 12.15 Non-Recourse. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under Section 12.14, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only
be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to
the extent provided under Section 12.14, except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (ii) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of

any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort,
equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more
of the Company, Acquiror under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 12.16 Acknowledgement and Waiver.



(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that each of the Company,
the Holders and the Seller has retained Meyers and Flowers LLC ("MandF") and
Kirkland and Ellis LLP ("KandE") to act as their counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that neither MandF nor KandE has acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby for conflict of interest or any other purposes. Acquiror and the
Company agree that any attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence attaching as a result of either of MandF's or KandE's representation of
the Company, any of the Holders and the Seller related to the preparation for,
and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all communications among MandF, KandE, the Company, the
Holders, the Seller and/or their respective Affiliates related to the
preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and
materials relating thereto) between the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and MandF or KandE related to the preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are hereby assigned and transferred to the Seller, (ii) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries hereby release all of their respective rights and
interests to and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries hereby release any right to assert or
waive any privilege related to the communications referenced in this Section
12.16 and acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside with the
Seller.



(b) Acquiror and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), agrees that, notwithstanding any
current, prior or future representation of the Company by MandF or KandE, each of
MandF and KandE shall be allowed to represent any of the Holders, the Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to
Acquiror or the Company that either is existing on the date hereof or arises
in the future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), hereby
waives any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in connection with
such representation. Further, Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing
between Acquiror or the Company, on the one hand, and any of the Holders, the
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other, each of MandF or KandE
may represent such Holder, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interests of such Holder, the Seller or any of
their respective Affiliate may be directly adverse to Acquiror or the Company
and even though MandF or KandE may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

(c) Acquiror, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges
that any advice given to or communication with any Holders, the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company) shall not be subject
to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by such Holder, the Seller
and any Affiliate of each such party. Each of Acquiror and the Company hereby
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
MandF and KandE.



Section 12.17 Parent Guarantee. Parent Guarantor hereby (i) agrees to take any
and all actions necessary to cause Acquiror to perform all of their respective
obligations under this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms
(including with respect to the consummation of the Transaction, the payment of
any and all amounts required pursuant to Article III and, if applicable, any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 10.2) (collectively, the "Guaranteed
Obligations") and (ii) absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees,
as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and complete performance
by Acquiror of the Guaranteed Obligations, and Parent Guarantor shall be
liable for any breach by Acquiror of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. This
is a guarantee of payment (not of collection) and performance. The Company
shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed
Obligations in the event that Acquiror becomes subject to bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceedings, and the failure of the Company to so
file shall not affect Parent Guarantor's obligations hereunder. In the event
that any payment to the Company in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever (other than
in circumstances where Parent Guarantor is not liable to make such payment),
Parent Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations as if such payment had not been rescinded or returned. Parent
Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, demand of payment, filing of any claim, any right to require any
proceeding first against Acquiror, protest, notice of any kind and all demands
whatsoever and all suretyship defenses generally in connection with the
performance of its covenants, agreements and obligations set forth in this
Section 12.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Acquiror is
relieved of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations by satisfaction
thereof on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
or pursuant to any other agreement with the Seller, Parent Guarantor shall be
similarly relieved of its corresponding obligations under this Section 12.17.
Parent Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that the waivers set forth in this Section 12.17 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.
