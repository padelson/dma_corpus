WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified in this

limited liability company ("ATMI BELGIUM"), ATMI Packaging, Inc., a Minnesota
company ("ATMI PACKAGING"), and Advanced Technology Materials, Inc., a

into that certain Share and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 22,
2013 (in the form filed by the Company with the SEC on December 23, 2013 as
exhibit 2.1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K, the "Life Sciences SAPA"),
pursuant to which the Life Science Sellers will sell the Life Sciences

Liabilities specified therein, prior to the Closing; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Life
Sciences SAPA and the closing thereunder is a condition precedent to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company").

  

  

Section 1.02. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP at 767 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10153 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of those
conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing between the Company and Parent; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the
Closing prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period, unless Parent shall request an earlier date on two (2)
Business Days' prior written notice (but, subject in such case, to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions)). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

Section 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate
of Merger"), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and at or prior to the Closing Date, shall make all
other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the
Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.04. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. At the Effective Time,
(i) the Company Charter shall be amended in the Merger to be the same as the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be
"Entegris-ATMI, Inc.") and until thereafter further amended in accordance with
its terms and as provided by the DGCL, shall be the amended and restated
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the Company
By-laws shall be amended in the Merger to be the same as the by-laws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name
of the Surviving Company shall be "Entegris-ATMI, Inc."), and as so amended
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and as provided by the DGCL or in the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Company.

  

  

Section 1.05. Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES

  

  

Section 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Parent
or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Surviving Company.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock
Owned by Company Subsidiaries.

  

  

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly
by Parent, Merger Sub or any Life Sciences Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Non-Life Sciences Subsidiary of the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub)
or of Merger Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Company such that the ownership percentage of any such
Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time
shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02 and Section
2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted
into shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with Section 2.01(b),
Company Restricted Stock Awards, and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and converted into the right to receive $34.00 per share in cash
(the "Merger Consideration") payable to each holder thereof, without interest
or dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of Taxes, in the manner
provided for in Section 2.02(i). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding of Taxes.

  

  

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend,

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Company
Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards and other awards under the Company Stock Plans
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; provided that with respect to outstanding Company Stock Options and
other awards made under the Company Stock Plans, any such adjustments shall be
made in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan.

  

  

Section 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this Article II through the
Paying Agent, in trust with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled or converted into
shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with Section 2.01(b), Company
Restricted Stock Awards, and Dissenting Shares), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration to such holders (the "Payment Fund").

  

  

(b) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock whose shares are converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 a form of letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall be in
such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as Parent may specify, subject to the Company's reasonable
approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with
instructions thereto.

  

  

(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the
case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or (ii) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which
such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section
2.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is held in book-
entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect
thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock are entitled
to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

  

  

(d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No cash payment with respect to the
Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form) until
the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II.

  

  

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II, upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock, shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and from and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

  

(f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law).

  

  

(g) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Payment
Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental
Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

  

 

(h) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the
Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of,
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any stockholder of the Company to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent
there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any

 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall
reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to
ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
to make such cash payments.

  

  

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company,
and the Paying Agent (without duplication), or other applicable withholding
agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, or Company Restricted Stock Unit
Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Law
with respect to Taxes. Amounts so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company Restricted Stock
Units Awards in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

(j) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall, in exchange for the cancellation of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
provided in this Article II.

  

  

Section 2.03. Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are
entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c),
and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any notices of intent, demands or other
communications received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an
Order, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

  

Section 2.04. Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock
Awards, Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards, ESPP and Company Stock Plans.
Prior to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering any Company Stock Plans) will take all actions as it deems
necessary or appropriate to give effect to this Section 2.04 to provide that:

  

  

(a) Treatment of Company Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option that is then outstanding and that has an
exercise price less than the Merger Consideration (whether or not then vested
or exercisable) (each such Company Stock Option, a "Cash-Out Option") shall be
cancelled and terminated, and each holder of a Cash-Out Option shall have the
right to receive from the Surviving Company, in respect of such Cash-Out
Option, an amount in cash (less applicable withholding taxes, if any) equal to
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out
Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2)
the exercise price per share of such Cash-Out Option, payable through payroll
promptly (but in any event no later than the later of ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date and the first regular payroll date following the
Closing Date) following the Closing Date. With respect to any Company Stock
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not
a Cash-Out Option, the Company shall cause the cancellation of such Company
Stock Option without any payment or consideration therefor.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is then outstanding
shall be cancelled and terminated, and each holder of a Company Restricted
Stock Award shall have the right to receive from the Surviving Company, in
respect of such Company Restricted Stock Award, an amount in cash (less
applicable withholding taxes, if any) equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award,
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, payable through payroll promptly
(but in any event no later than the later of ten (10) Business Days following
the Closing Date and the first regular payroll date following the Closing
Date) following the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is then
outstanding shall be cancelled and terminated, and each holder of a Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award shall have the right to receive from the Surviving
Company, in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, an amount in
cash (less applicable withholding taxes, if any) equal to (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award (determined in accordance with terms of the applicable Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award based on the actual performance achieved as if the
Closing Date represented the end date of the performance period), multiplied
by (ii) the Merger Consideration, payable through payroll promptly (but in any
event no later than the later of ten (10) Business Days following the Closing
Date and the first regular payroll date following the Closing Date) following
the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) Treatment of ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions necessary (i) to suspend the
ESPP effective immediately such that no additional Offering Periods shall be
commenced between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (ii) to
cancel each outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the ESPP and (iii) to refund all sums collected from
participants during the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) then in
progress.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(e) Termination of Company Stock Plans. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof,
which Parent will have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
prior to their presentation to the Company Board or such committee) that may
be necessary (under the Company Stock Plans and/or related award agreements
and the ESPP) to terminate each Company Stock Plan and the ESPP as of the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP
shall be terminated and shall cease to exist without any liability to the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than the obligation to pay the amounts set forth in
Sections 2.04(a), (b), (c) and (d)).

  

  

(f) Treatment of Director Deferred Units. Following the Effective Time, each
participant in a Director Deferred Compensation Plan shall have the right to
receive from the Surviving Company an amount in cash (less applicable
withholding taxes, if any) equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of Stock Credits (as defined in
the applicable Director Deferred Compensation Plan) then credited to such
participant's Stock Account (as defined in the applicable Director Deferred
Compensation Plan), payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Director Deferred Compensation Plan.

  

  

ARTICLE III

Section 3.01. Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in

would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent has delivered or made available to the Company, prior to execution
of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the restated certificate of
incorporation of Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Parent Charter") and the amended and restated by-laws of Parent in effect as
of the date of this Agreement (the "Parent By-laws") and true and complete
copies of the restated certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect as of
the date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.02. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to which it is a party. Parent Board and the board of
directors of Merger Sub have (i) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, (ii) determined that entering into this
Agreement is fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its
stockholders or Merger Sub and its stockholders, as applicable, and (iii)
declared this Agreement and the Merger advisable. No other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize or adopt this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to which it is a party (except for the filing of the
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). The execution, delivery
and performance by Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are within the
corporate powers of Merger Sub and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub have each
duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity.

  

  

 

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization; Non-contravention.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby to which it is a party require no action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity other than (i) the filing of a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which Parent or Merger Sub is qualified to do business, (ii) filings
required under, and compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and any other applicable Regulatory Law as set forth on Section 4.03 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable U.S. state or
federal securities laws, and (iv) consents, approvals, Orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations, and filings the failure of which to be obtained,
made or given have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to
which it is a party

 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation
or breach of any provision of the Parent Charter or Parent By-laws or the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Merger Sub, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03(a), contravene,
conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law, (iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any Contract binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any governmental licenses,
authorizations, Permits, consents (including consents required by Contract),
approvals, variances, exemptions or Orders affecting, or relating in any way
to, the assets or business of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.04. Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any
Order to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in each case, for those that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
subject to an outstanding Order that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.05. Ownership of Merger Sub.

  

  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. All of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned beneficially
and of record by Parent, free and clear of all Liens.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has no assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective
Time, will not have engaged in any other business activities other than those
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 4.06. Financing. Parent will have available to it at the Closing,
sufficient cash to consummate the Merger and to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to the Paying Agent and any other amounts required to be paid by
Parent in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby to which it is a party and to pay all related fees and expenses of
Parent and Merger Sub, and there is no restriction on the use of such cash for
such purposes. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy, including all exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto, of the
fully executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Goldman
Sachs Bank USA (the "Commitment Party") to Parent (the "Debt Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which the Commitment Party has committed, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein (subject to any "market flex"
provisions

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

included in the fee letter dated the date hereof referred to therein (the "Fee
Letter"), a true and complete copy of which has been delivered to the Company
with fees, economic terms and other customary provisions redacted), to provide
the financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing").
The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner
prior to the date of this Agreement and the respective commitments contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has entered into any agreement,
side letter, contract or other arrangement relating to the financing of the
payments to be made by them at the Effective Time, other than as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and the engagement letter
related thereto or as permitted under Section 6.11 (complete copies of each of
which have been provided to the Company, with only fee and other economic
amounts redacted). The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Commitment Party, to provide the financing contemplated
thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and, in each case, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting rights of creditors. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid)
any and all commitment fees and other amounts, if any, that are due and
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III such that the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) is satisfied, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default on the part of
Parent, or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto
under the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
such that the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) is satisfied, the
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the
satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section
7.02, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that Parent will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing to be satisfied pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to
any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letter) on or prior to the
Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing (including pursuant to
any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letter), other than the
conditions precedent set forth in and contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and the payment of customary fees. Parent and Merger Sub understand and
acknowledge that under the terms of this Agreement, Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Merger are not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to Parent's or Merger Sub's consummation of any financing
arrangements, Parent's or Merger Sub's obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent or
Merger Sub.

  

  

Section 4.07. No Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their Affiliates is or has been during the past three years an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.
None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their controlled Affiliates beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly, or is the record holder of (or during the past
three years has beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or been the record
holder of), or is (or during the past three years has been) a party to any
Contract (other

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

than this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement), arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of,
in each case, any shares of Company Common Stock or any option, warrant or
other right to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

Section 4.08. Brokers' Fees and Expenses. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co., the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates.

  

  

Section 4.09. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article III or in any certificate
delivered by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms
hereof (and notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the Company or its
Representatives of any documentation, projections, estimates, budgets or other
information), Parent acknowledges that none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any other Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.02. No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation.

  

  

(a) No Solicitation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.02, from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors and officers
not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries' employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, with such
directors and officers referred to above, "Representatives") not to, directly
or indirectly (i) solicit, seek, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing any non-public information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any submission or announcement of a
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose
of encouraging or facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) approve, endorse, recommend, submit to stockholders or declare advisable
any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent, term sheet,
memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or modify, amend or

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

waive any provision in any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or (v) release or terminate or permit the release of any
Person from, or termination of, or waive or modify or permit the waiver or
modification of any provision of, or fail to enforce or cause not to be
enforced, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except to the extent that the
failure to so release, terminate, waive, modify or fail to enforce would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable
Law. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
directors and officers to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives (other than its and their directors
and officers) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions
and negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than
forty-eight (48) hours following the execution of the Agreement) demand that
each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with the
Company with respect to consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal at
anytime after January 1, 2013 (other than agreements that have expired by
their terms) immediately return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives to such Person, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives.

  

  

(b) Discussions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a)
or any other provision hereof, if (i) at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of
Persons, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach of this
Section 5.02, and (ii) in the case of the following clauses (B) and (C), the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, then the Company and its Representatives may (A) contact the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify
terms for the sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such
Acquisition Proposal, (B) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) provide or make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided or
made available to any Person given such access which was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives and (C) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02 by any Representative of the
Company, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 5.02 by
the Company.

  

  

(c) Notice of Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Parent orally
and in writing after receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of
any Acquisition Proposal, any proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including of the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or
other request and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
provide copies to Parent of any written proposals, indications of interest,
and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall keep Parent informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including
changes to any material terms of, and any other material developments with
respect to) such Acquisition Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of
any additional or revised written proposals, indications of interest, and/or
draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal). The Company agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.02.

  

  

(d) Adverse Recommendation Change. Except as set forth in this Section
5.02(d), the Company Board shall not (i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose or
resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company, an
Acquisition Proposal, or (D) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing if there has been any public disclosure by a third party related to an
actual Acquisition Proposal by such third party; provided that the Company
will be obligated to make such reaffirmation only once in response to each
such actual Acquisition Proposal made by such third party; and provided,
further, that if the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to take place
less than three (3) Business Days after such request, the Company will
reaffirm the Company Recommendation prior to such meeting), or (E) if a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company, provided that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be
prohibited within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer (any of the foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) authorize, adopt or approve or propose to authorize, adopt or
approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company Board may (I) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, if and only if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (II) if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), authorize, adopt, or approve such
Superior Proposal and cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company Board may only take the actions described in (x)
clause (II) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d) concurrently with entering into

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the applicable Termination Fee
in compliance with Section 8.03(b)(i) and (y) clauses (I) or (II) if:

  

  

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of its or the
Company Board's intention to take such actions at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify (x) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of the Superior Proposal and
shall include a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and
the identity of, the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, or (y) in cases
not involving a Superior Proposal, the material circumstances giving rise to
the Adverse Recommendation Change;

  

  

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such
three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company or the Company Board
not to take such actions; provided, that any material change to the terms of
such Superior Proposal or to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new notice including the details required by
the notice described in clause (i) above and the Company shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.02(d)(y) with respect to
each such material change; provided, further that with respect to each
subsequent written notice related to a material change references to the three
(3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period; and

  

  

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent
by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on the third (3rd) Business Day of such three
(3) Business Day period (or the last day of any applicable extension pursuant
to clause (ii) above) and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect
to the actions described in clause (I) after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause (II), after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, in each case, even if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were given effect.

  

  

  

The Company shall be required to comply with the obligations under the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) with respect to each Superior Proposal it
receives or any Intervening Event the Company Board identifies.

  

  

(e) Disclosure Obligations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company or the Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders if the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 5.02(d). For
the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

statement that describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (without including a
reaffirmation) shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub) providing for (a) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more (based on the fair market
value, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (or any committee
thereof)) of assets (including capital stock of the Company's Subsidiaries) or
of the consolidated revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole determined after giving effect to the
completion of the transactions contemplated by the Life Sciences SAPA, or (2)
shares or other equity securities of the Company which together with any other
shares or other equity securities of the Company beneficially owned by such
person or group, would equal 20% or more of aggregate voting power of the
Company, (b) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person or group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the aggregate voting power of the Company, (c) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which any Person or group (or the shareholders of any
Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, or (d) any
recapitalization transaction involving the Company, other than, in each case,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any offer or proposal
solely and exclusively with respect to the Life Sciences Assets and the Life
Sciences Liabilities, or any portion thereof.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with all references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal being deemed to be references to "50%") which the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, and (y) if consummated, would be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Merger, in each case, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, any fees to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03 and to the
likelihood of consummating such Acquisition Proposal without undue delay in
accordance with its terms).

  

  

(iii) "Intervening Event" means a material event, development or change in
circumstances with respect to the Company occurring or coming to the attention
of the Company's Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval for the Merger, and which was not known, and
could not reasonably be expected to have known or foreseen, by the Company
Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in
no event shall (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal,
(B) any events, developments or change in circumstances of Parent, (C) the
status of the Merger under the HSR Act or of any of the Required Antitrust
Approvals, (D)

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any announcements, approvals, issuances, or regulations of any Governmental
Entity, constitute an Intervening Event, or (E) any matter relating to the
foregoing or consequence of the foregoing, constitute an Intervening Event.

  

  

Section 5.03. Sale of the Life Sciences Business. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts
to consummate the Closing (as defined in the Life Sciences SAPA).

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 6.01. Preparation and Mailing of the Proxy Statement.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC a proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement").
The Company agrees that it will cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company and Parent
agree that none of the information supplied by the Company or Parent,
respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives, for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time it is first published or mailed to the stockholders of the Company, at
the time of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Subject to Section 5.02,
the Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation to the Company's
stockholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent and its Affiliates to
the Company, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested
by the Company to be included therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the resolution of any comments received from the SEC. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of
any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to resolve as
promptly as practicable such comments with the SEC. Prior to filing or mailing
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments, the Company shall provide Parent a

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response or
to participate in any meeting (telephonic or otherwise) with the SEC. The
Company agrees that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.01(a), and notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall take all necessary actions in accordance with
Applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company By-laws and the rules of the
NASDAQ to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
including engaging a proxy solicitation firm reasonably acceptable to Parent
to assist with proxy solicitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company may not adjourn, recess or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting except (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that
any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Applicable Law
is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of
time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or to
solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if
sufficient votes to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have not been
obtained.

  

  

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by
Applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Company's stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c)
shall limit the obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

  

  

(d) The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms prior thereto, its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Company Board; provided, however, that (x) if the
public announcement of an Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery of
notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section 5.02(d)(i) occurs less
than ten (10) days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall be entitled to postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date not
more than ten (10) days after the later of such event; and (y) the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to Applicable
Law and as further set forth on Section 6.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford the
Parent and the Parent's Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours, during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, assets, books,
contracts, commitments, plans, Tax records and Tax Returns, work papers,
personnel, Representatives and records and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Parent (a)
to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws or commission
actions and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may be reasonably requested, including all information regarding
the Life Sciences SAPA (including, without limitation, with respect to the
Restructuring Transactions or the Transition Services Agreement) and all
information necessary to enable Parent to prepare the financial statements and
related disclosures required to be included in Parent's Current Report on Form
8-K following the Closing (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in
any material respect with the normal business operations of the Company its
Subsidiaries); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent that such disclosure
or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third-party (provided that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any such agreement's counterparty to such inspection or
disclosure), (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege
(provided that the Company will provide Parent with appropriate information
regarding the factual basis underlying any circumstances that resulted in the
preparation of such privileged analysis), or (iii) violate any Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the extent such access or information
is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, are adverse parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section
6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of September
24, 2013, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").
Subject to the limitations and restrictions set forth in, and without
expanding the obligations of the Parties under, this Section 6.02, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent
and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the planning of the integration of the
parties and their respective businesses after the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and
fully

  

  

  

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

  

  

all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers,
Permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental
Entity necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any
Action brought by a third party that could otherwise prevent or impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of
clauses (i) through (iv), other than with respect to filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, Permits,
authorizations and other confirmations relating to Regulatory Laws, which are
the subject of Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d).

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or
regulation (collectively, "Takeover Laws") is or becomes applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and refrain from taking any
actions that would cause the applicability of such Takeover Laws and (ii) if
the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to
ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and make any filing
required under any other applicable Regulatory Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable following the date hereof (which, in the case of the
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, shall be no later than
ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof and, in the case of all other
filings under any other Regulatory Law, shall be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, or, in each case, as otherwise agreed
to by the Company and Parent), (ii) supply as promptly as practicable and
advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Regulatory Law and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Regulatory Laws and to obtain all consents under any Regulatory Laws that may
be required by the FTC, DOJ or any Governmental Entity with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Regulatory Law,
including (A) defending any Action challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to which it is a party
(including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed), (B) executing
settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements
with any Governmental Entity or with any other Person, (C) terminating
existing

  

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

  

relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries and (D) effectuating any other change or
restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, in
each case, to the extent necessary to obtain all consents that may be required
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Regulatory Laws or to resolve any
objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall (W) require Parent or Merger Sub to sell,
divest, convey or hold separate or otherwise take any other action (and the
Company will not undertake any such action without Parent's prior written
consent) that limits Parent's and its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, particular products, assets or
businesses of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or agree
to take any such action, other than, solely in respect of products, assets or
businesses of the Company (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, any products,
assets, or businesses of Parent), only to the extent that such action would
not reasonably be expected to impact in any material respect the expected
benefits to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (X) require Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing, (Y) require any of the parties to this Agreement
to compensate any third party, commence or participate in litigation or offer
or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to
obtain any such consent or approval or (Z) permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to any action or other matter pursuant to this
Section 6.03 referred to in clauses (B)-(D) or (X) above without Parent's
prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Other than with
respect to the payment of all filing fees in connection therewith, which will
be borne solely by Parent, the parties shall each bear their own costs and
expenses of preparing such notifications and filings, including the fees of
their respective legal counsel.

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity by any Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to
Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other parties hereto with respect to
information relating to the other parties hereto and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity, or in any filings or
submissions in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood
that certain documents including those submitted under Item 4(c) or 4(d) of
the Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act may be subject to
reasonable redactions), and (iv) to the extent practicable and permitted by
the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or private
party, as the case may be, give the other parties hereto the opportunity to
attend and participate in any meetings and conferences. Any party may, as it
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this
Section 6.03(d) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

  

  

Section 6.04. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law (including to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the to which a
corporation may indemnify its officers and directors) the Surviving Company
agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of
the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of
the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective
Time, serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another Person (the "Company Indemnified Parties"),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines,
amounts paid in settlement and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys'
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any actual or threatened
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring or alleged to occur
at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such Action, (x) each Company Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such Action from the Surviving Company within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the
Surviving Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in
effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to the
extent they provide for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation of each Company Indemnified Party, as applicable,
with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, on the same basis as set forth in the Company Charter and Company By-
laws

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted from
time to time under Applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended
except as required by Applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by
Applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Company Indemnified
Parties' indemnification rights thereunder.

  

  

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

  

  

(d) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
the same or better ratings with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as the Company's carrier as of the
date of this Agreement), except that in no event shall the Surviving Company
be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any
one policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum
Amount"), and if the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance
required by this Section 6.04 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such
period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may,
at its option (following reasonable consultation with Parent), purchase a
"tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors' and
officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; provided that in no event shall the cost of any such tail
policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. In the
event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Company shall
cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section
6.04(d). The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  

  

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries under
this Section 6.04.

  

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.04 shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

  

  

Section 6.05. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.06. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court process or
the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to any release or other public statement to the extent containing
information that is consistent with the joint press release referred to below
or any other release or public statement previously issued or made in
accordance with this Section 6.06; provided, further, that the Company need
not consult Parent in connection with the matters referred to in and in
accordance with Section 5.02, including any press release or public statement
to be issued or made in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change made
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.02, and Parent need not consult
the Company in connection with any matters referred to in Section 5.02. The
parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby following execution of this Agreement
will be a joint press release and shall be in a form agreed to by Parent and
the Company. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including the
first sentence of this Section) or as required by Applicable Law, no party
shall issue any press release or make any public statement regarding the other
party or the other party's operations, directors, officers or employees
without obtaining the other party's prior written consent. In addition, the
parties shall coordinate with respect to communications with employees,
suppliers, customers, agents and other stakeholders regarding post-Closing
transition, integration and related matters.

  

  

Section 6.07. Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Until December 31, 2014, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remains in
the employment of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (a "Continuing Employee") with: (i) at least the same base salary or base
wages and annual cash bonus opportunities as were provided to such individual
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

employee benefits (other than equity compensation) that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided under the applicable Company Benefit
Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date. From January 1, 2015 through at least the one-year anniversary
of the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide each
Continuing Employee with base salary or base wages, annual cash bonus
opportunities and employee benefits (other than equity compensation) that are
no less favorable than the base salary or base wages and annual cash bonus
opportunities and that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits (other than equity compensation) provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to any Continuing Employee who is laid off, made redundant or whose employment
is otherwise terminated without cause or for good reason (if applicable) (in
each case, as defined in the severance applicable plan or program) during the
one-year period following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to honor the terms of the Company's severance plans and programs
as disclosed on Section 6.07(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect
to such Continuing Employee.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, credit Continuing
Employees for service earned on and prior to the Effective Time with the
Company and its Affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors, to the
extent such service was credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan prior to Closing, in addition to service
earned with Parent and its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, (i) for
purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick days,
severance, layoff and/or similar benefits (but not for purposes of defined
benefit pension benefit accruals) under any retirement or other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
the benefit of the Continuing Employees on or after the Closing Date and (ii)
for such additional purposes as may be required by Applicable Law; provided
that nothing herein shall result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
Continuing Employees.

  

  

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to waive limitations on benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions of Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses and
dependents (to the extent such limitations were waived under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing). Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to recognize for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable
to Continuing Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Continuing Employees and their respective spouses and dependents the Company's
or any of its Affiliates' health plans in the calendar year in which the
applicable Effective Time occurs.

  

  

(e) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code,
effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. In
the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
that such 401(k)

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to the methodology set forth in the
applicable plan not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Without otherwise limiting the generality of Section 9.07, the provisions
of this Section 6.07 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any
of its Affiliates), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section
6.07) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 6.07 shall amend, or be deemed to amend (or, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.07, prevent the amendment or termination of) any
Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, agreement or other
arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.07(a),
Parent shall honor the plans and agreements set forth on Section 6.07(f) of
the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms. Parent shall
have no obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any
Continuing Employee for any period of time following the Closing.

  

  

Section 6.08. Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries. Parent
shall cause each of Merger Sub and any other applicable Subsidiary of Parent
to comply with and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this
Agreement, including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to comply with and perform all of its obligations under or
relating to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.09. Stock Exchange De-Listing. Parent shall cause the Company's
securities to be de-listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.10. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense (at Parent's sole cost and subject
to a joint defense agreement) of any stockholder litigation brought against
the Company or its directors or officers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation
and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the
status thereof.

  

  

Section 6.11. Financing.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub in this Section 6.11(a) to obtain Alternative Financing), Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and use their reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange the Debt

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

Financing and to consummate the Debt Financing at the Effective Time,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all of the conditions
precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (iii) negotiate, execute
and deliver definitive documentation for the Debt Financing that reflects the
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to any "market flex"
provisions included in the Fee Letter or any fee letter relating to an
Alternative Financing); and (iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 and the conditions precedent set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
satisfied, cause the financing providers to fund the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent and Merger Sub
shall have the right from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment
Letter and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion
of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources
(together with any alternative financing as described in clause (b) below,
each an "Alternative Financing"); provided, that any such amendment,
restatement, supplement, replacement or other modification to or waiver of any
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter that amends the Debt Financing and/or
substitution of all or any portion of the Debt Financing shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount, unless the Debt Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount on substantially the same terms as provided in the
applicable Debt Commitment Letter) to be funded at Closing, (B) impose new or
additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise amend, modify, or expand any
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing (unless such
conditions precedent or contingencies to the Alternative Financing would not
be reasonably expected to (i) prevent or delay the Closing, (ii) make the
funding of the Debt Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur, (iii) adversely affect the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its respective rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto), (C) release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter (except for assignments and replacements of an individual
lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Debt
Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter), (D) otherwise prevent or delay the Closing or (E) reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto; provided, further, that Parent and
Merger Sub may amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the
Debt Commitment Letter (or any Alternative Financing) on one or more occasions
to add additional arrangers, bookrunners, agents and lenders in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (but not to make any other
changes other than to the extent otherwise permitted under this Section
6.11(a)). For purposes of this Agreement, the definition of "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include any amendment, restatement, supplement or other
modification or waiver thereto, or any replacement thereof, and the definition
of "Debt Financing" shall include any Alternative Financing, in each case
permitted under this Section 6.11(a) or clause (b) below.

  

  

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to any "market
flex" provisions

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

  

  

included in the Fee Letter and other than on account of any Alternative
Financing referred to in clause (a) above having been completed) other than
due to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing
resulting from a material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the failure of any condition set
forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such portion
from alternative debt or equity sources as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event in an amount that will still enable Parent and
Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to which it is a party
and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub.

  

  

(c) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and shall provide to the Company copies of any amendment, restatement,
replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter and all
executed final definitive documents relating to the Debt Financing (excluding
any provisions related solely to fees and economic terms (other than
covenants) agreed to by the parties thereto and any provisions in any fee or
engagement letters as customarily excluded by the Financing Sources). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice which shall include reasonably detailed information regarding
the circumstances referenced in the following clause: (i) if Parent becomes
aware of any material breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing; (ii) of the
receipt by it of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Debt Financing with respect to the obligation to fund any portion of the
Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing;
(iii) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the "market flex" provisions included in
the Fee Letter or any fee letter relating to any Alternative Financing) or the
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing, and (iv) upon receiving
the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, after the date the
Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any additional information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

(d) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, Parent and
Merger Sub such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any Debt Financing, including (in each case to the extent
reasonably requested) (A) participating, upon reasonable advance notice, in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, rating agency
presentations and drafting sessions, and

Financing), (B) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, with the Required Information, (C) assisting Parent
and the Financing Sources in the preparation of (I) customary offering
documents, syndication documents and materials (including assistance in
creating usual and customary "public versions" of the foregoing), including
confidential information memoranda, private placement memoranda, offering
memoranda, lender and investor presentations, rating agency presentations,
business and financial projections and similar documents and materials, in
connection with any Debt Financing (all of the foregoing, collectively, the
"Offering Documents"), including providing the "MDandA" and business description
to be contained therein, and providing customary authorization and
representation letters with respect thereto, and (II) materials for any
Offering Documents, including business projections and financial statements
(including assisting the Parent in preparing pro forma financial statements;
provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for any pro forma
adjustments relating to proposed debt and equity capitalization that is
required to be made to the historical information for such pro forma financial
information) and identifying any portion thereof as containing material, non-
public information, (D) reasonably cooperating with the marketing and
syndication efforts of Parent, Merger Sub and any Financing Sources for any
portion of any Debt Financing, including cooperation in connection with the
obtainment of ratings, (E) using its reasonable best efforts to cause its
current or former independent accountants to provide assistance and
cooperation in any Debt Financing, including (I) participating in a reasonable
number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions, (II)
providing any necessary written consents to use their audit reports relating
to the Company and to be named as an "Expert" in any document related to any
Debt Financing and (III) providing any customary "comfort letters" (including
customary negative assurance comfort, including change period comfort), (F)
executing and delivering as of (but not before) the Closing Date definitive
financing documents, including credit agreements, indentures, intercreditor
agreements, pledge and security documents, and certificates (including
borrowing base certificates), or other documents, to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent and otherwise facilitating the granting or perfection of
collateral to secure any Debt Financing, including delivery of certificates
representing equity interests constituting collateral, intellectual property

any Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at least five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information required by
any Governmental Entity with respect to any Debt Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act, in each case, to the extent that such documentation
and information has been reasonably requested in writing (which may be by
e-mail) at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, (H) assisting in the
delivery of inventory appraisals and field audits and obtaining surveys and
title insurance reasonably requested by Parent and (I) taking all corporate
actions, subject to and only effective upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of any Debt

Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time; provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A)

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action that would cause it to bear any out-of-pocket cost or expense (not
otherwise subject to reimbursement) or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other similar payment or incur any other monetary liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing, in each case, to the extent effective prior
to the Effective Time, (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be required to take any action under this Section 6.11
that would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (C) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that will conflict with or
violate their respective organizational documents or result in the
contravention of any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party that is material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole prior to the Effective Time (it being agreed,
however, that the foregoing clauses (B) and (C) shall not apply to (and shall
not in any manner affect) the Company\'s obligations hereunder with respect to
the delivery of the Required Information or with respect to the other actions
under this Section 6.11(d) that are usual and customary with respect to
syndicated credit facilities or high yield offerings). The Company hereby
consents to the reasonable use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the marketing of any Debt Financing; provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its or their
respective marks, products, services, offerings or intellectual property
rights.

  

  

(e) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance
with this Section 6.11) and any information utilized in connection therewith,
in any case, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad
faith, the gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this
Agreement by or of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives. In addition, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Section 6.11.

  

  

(f) This Section 6.11 shall be the only provision in this Agreement setting
forth the Company's obligations to cooperate or provide information or access
or take any other action in respect of the Debt Financing.

  

  

Section 6.12. Resignation of Directors. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to the Effective Time
the resignation of the Company's directors with such resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time.

shall be limited to one (1) written request), the Company shall furnish a
written request to the parties to a Contract that relates to the Life Sciences
Business and is included in the Life Sciences Assets or the Life Sciences
Liabilities to be sold to or assumed by the Life Sciences Buyer pursuant to
the Life Sciences SAPA to provide a full release of the Company and each Non-
Life Sciences Subsidiary that is a party to such Contract from all of the
Company's and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

such Non-Life Sciences Subsidiary's obligations and liabilities thereunder;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Company complies with the
requirements of this Section 6.13, but is unable to obtain any such release,
such failure shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.13.

  

  

Section 6.14. Third Party Consents. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their commercially
reasonable efforts, to take all actions reasonably requested by Parent to
obtain waivers and consents from any and all third parties with respect to
each Material Contract for which such waiver or consent is required in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay any consideration to any
third party in connection with obtaining such consent or waiver; provided,
further, that the Company shall not agree to any change to such Contracts that
would be materially adverse to the interests of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or, after the Merger, Parent or any of the Non-Life Sciences Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, further, that if the
Company complies with the requirements of this Section 6.14, but is unable to
obtain any such consent, such failure shall not be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.14.

  

  

Section 6.15. Cash Balances. Except as set forth on Section 6.15 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent prior to the Closing with respect to the Company's
existing cash balances, cash equivalents and marketable securities to enable
Parent to use a portion of such cash balances, cash equivalents and marketable
securities to fund a portion of the Merger Consideration; provided that (i)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action under this Section 6.15 that would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing and
(ii) if this Agreement is terminated with the Closing not having occurred,
Parent shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company as a result of
actions taken at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.15.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

Section 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before August 4, 2014 (the "End
Date"); provided, however, that (x) if, on the End Date, (A) any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) (if
such legal restraint is in respect of a Regulatory Law) shall not have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived by both the
Company and Parent or (B) the Marketing Period shall not have been completed
by the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to such End Date, but in the
case of either (A) or (B), all other conditions to the Closing (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived, then in
the case of (A) above, the End Date shall, without any action on the part of
the parties hereto, be extended to November 4, 2014, or such earlier date as
may be

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

agreed in writing by Parent and the Company, and, in the case of (B) above,
the End Date shall be extended to the earlier of November 4, 2014 and the
third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period, and
in each case such date shall become the End Date for purposes of this
Agreement and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the
Closing when required pursuant to Section 1.02 hereof) materially contributed
to the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such date (it
being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  

  

(ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent authority issues a final
nonappealable Order or enacts a law that prohibits, restrains or makes illegal
the consummation of the Merger; or

  

  

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a
duly convened Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.01(b)(iii) shall not be available to the Company where the failure
to obtain the approval of the stockholders of the Company shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach by the Company of this Agreement; or

  

  

(iv) if the Life Sciences SAPA is terminated in accordance with its terms
without a closing occurring thereunder; provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(iv) shall not be available to
the Company where the failure of the closing under the Life Sciences SAPA
shall have been caused by the action or failure to act of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Life Sciences SAPA.

  

  

(c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub has breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub has become untrue, in each
case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section
7.03(b), as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.01(c) unless any such breach or failure to be true has not
been cured within 30 days after written notice by the Company to Parent
informing Parent of such breach or failure to be true, except that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the End Date; and provided, further, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if the Company is
then in breach of this Agreement in any material respect;

  

  

(d) by the Company prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal in accordance with Section 5.02(d);

  

  

(e) by the Company, if the conditions to closing set forth in Sections 7.01
and 7.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at the Closing and which were, at the time of
termination, reasonably expected to be satisfied at the

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

Closing) and Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Closing
on the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02;

  

  

(f) by Parent, if the Company has breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b), as the case may
be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(f)
unless any such breach or failure to be true has not been cured within 30 days
after written notice by Parent to the Company informing the Company of such
breach or failure to be true, except that no cure period shall be required for
a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to the End Date; and
provided, further, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.01(f) if Parent is then in breach of this Agreement in any
material respect; or

  

  

(g) by Parent, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the event that an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred.

  

  

Section 8.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
other than the penultimate sentence of Section 6.02, this Section 8.02,
Section 8.03 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination,
provided, however, that, no such termination shall relieve any party from any
liability or damages arising out of: (i) fraud by any party or (ii) any
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
and without limiting the foregoing, any failure of the Parent or Merger Sub,
on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to consummate the Closing
hereunder following the satisfaction or waiver of such party's conditions to
closing under this Agreement shall be a willful and intentional breach by such
party of this Agreement, except that, in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, any
such failure to consummate the Closing due to a Financing Failure under
circumstances where neither Parent nor Merger Sub has breached in any material
respect its obligations under Section 6.11 of this Agreement shall not be a
willful or intentional breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.03. Fees and Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as specifically provided for herein, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not such transactions are consummated.

  

  

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $30,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee") if:

  

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g); or

  

  

(ii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company and not
publicly withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or shall have
been made

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

directly to the stockholders of the Company generally and not publicly
withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), Section 8.01(b)(iii),
Section 8.01(b)(iv) or Section 8.01(f); and (C) within 12 months of such
termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have approved or
recommended to the Company's stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an
Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently consummated; provided, however, that
for purposes of this Section 8.03(b)(ii), the references to 20% in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

  

  

(c) Any Termination Fee due under Section 8.03(b) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.03(b)(i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
in the case of any such termination by Parent (or simultaneously with such
termination in the case of any such termination by the Company), and (y) in
the case of Section 8.03(b)(ii) above, on the date of consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in Section 8.03(b)(ii)(C) above.

  

  

(d) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
Section 8.03(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.03(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences an Action that results in a judgment in its favor for such payment,
the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime
interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest
begins accruing. Except with respect to any fraud or willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement by the Company, the parties agree that the payment of
the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent
and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company, the Company, the
Company's Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

  

(e) Parent shall pay the Company a fee of $100,000,000 (the "Parent
Termination Fee") if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e). Any Parent Termination Fee and expenses due under this Section
8.03(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the Business Day
immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in Section
8.03(e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.03(e), and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences an Action that results in a judgment in its favor for such
payment, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
reasonable

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime
interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest
begins accruing. Except with respect to any fraud or willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the parties agree that the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to the Company with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable;
provided, however, that the right of the Company to receive the Parent
Termination Fee if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(e) shall not affect the Company's right to specific performance as
provided herein prior to any termination of this Agreement. Upon payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, Parent, Merger Sub, their Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives
shall have no further liability to the Company under this Agreement. In no
event shall Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

  

  

Section 8.04. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law or the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without the further approval of such stockholders, and (ii) except as provided
above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the
stockholders of the Company unless required by Applicable Law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.04
or elsewhere in this Agreement, this Section 8.04 and Sections 8.05, 9.07,
9.08(d), 9.08(e) and 9.11 (and any definition set forth in, or other provision
of, this Agreement to the extent that an amendment or modification of such
definition or other provision would amend or modify the substance of this
Section 8.04 or Section 8.05, 9.07, 9.08(d), 9.08(e) or 9.11) may not be
amended or modified in a manner that would be adverse to any Financing Source
(or any Financing Source's Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates' former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, controlling persons, agents, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, financial advisors or any of their successors or assigns
(collectively, "Financing Related Parties") without the prior written consent
of such Financing Source (and any such amendment or modification without such
prior written consent shall be null and void).

  

  

Section 8.05. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of
any of the conditions contained in this Agreement; provided that there shall
be no waiver to this Section 8.05 or Section 8.04, 9.07, 9.08(d), 9.08(e) or
9.11 (or any provision of this Agreement to the extent a waiver of such
provision would modify the substance of this Section 8.05 or Section 8.04,
9.07, 9.08(d) or 9.11) in a manner that would be adverse to any Financing
Source (or its Financing Related Parties) without the prior written consent of
such Financing Source (and any such amendment or modification without such
prior written consent shall be null and void). No extension or waiver by the
Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

the Company unless such approval is required by Applicable Law. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

  

Section 8.06. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.05 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of either
Parent or the Company.

such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents
to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.02.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source or any Financing Related Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any federal court of the United
States of America located in, or, if that court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in, in each case, the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York.

  

  

(e) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY
DISPUTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES OR
ANY FINANCING RELATED PARTY) OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.08.

  

  

Section 9.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; provided that Parent and Merger
Sub may grant a security interest in, and collaterally assign, any of their
rights under this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. No
assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section 9.09 shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 9.10. Specific Enforcement. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that a breach by it of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the
other parties hereto and that no party hereto will have an adequate remedy at
law. Therefore, it is agreed that each party shall be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed
that, without limiting the Company's right to seek specific enforcement of the
other obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement to
the extent expressly permitted hereunder, the Company shall be entitled to
specific enforcement of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate
the Merger only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and 7.02 have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied or waived at the Closing and that are reasonably expected to
be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.02, (iii) there has not been a Financing Failure, and (iv) the
Company has confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that if specific
enforcement is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Company is
ready, willing and able to, and will, consummate the Closing. In addition, it
is agreed that the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent's
and Merger Sub's obligation under this Agreement to draw upon the Debt
Financing only if (i) all of the conditions to closing set forth in Section
7.01 and 7.02 and all of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing but that are
reasonably expected to be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the Company has
confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that if specific enforcement
is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then, assuming performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations under this Agreement,
then the Company is ready, willing and able to, and will, consummate the
Closing, and (iii) the full proceeds to be provided to Parent by the Debt
Financing in accordance with its terms shall be available to Parent to
consummate the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific enforcement (as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Section 9.10) and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (as and only to the extent expressly permitted by Section
8.03(f)), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both such grant of specific enforcement and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee. Each of the parties hereto expressly disclaims that it is
owed any duties not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and waives and
releases any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.11. No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that all claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of action, whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to enter into, this

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

Agreement) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be made only
against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified
as parties to this Agreement in the Preamble to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company agrees, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates and each of its and its Affiliates' respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, controlling persons, agents or Representatives (collectively, the
"Company Parties") that the Financing Sources and each of their respective
Financing Related Parties shall be subject to no liability or claims to the
Company Parties in connection with the Debt Financing or in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
