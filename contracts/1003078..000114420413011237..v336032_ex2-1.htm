EBITDA Threshold and Closing Adjusted EBITDA, _multiplied by_ (b) fifteen
(15) (as so adjusted and as adjusted pursuant to the remainder of this
_Section 2.2_ and _ARTICLE III_ , the " _Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

(b) The Closing Adjusted EBITDA shall be final and binding on the
Parties unless Buyer shall, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
deliver to Seller written notice of any disagreement with the calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA including the Audited Financial Statements as they relate to
the determination of Adjusted EBITDA, which notice shall describe the nature
of any such disagreement. If Buyer raises any objections within the aforesaid
sixty (60) day period, then Seller and Buyer shall in good faith attempt
to resolve the disputed matter. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all
disagreements within thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller of the written
notice of disagreement, then within ten (10) days thereafter, Seller and/or
Buyer shall submit such items that remain in dispute for resolution to the
Accounting Arbitrator. The Buyer agrees that in connection with the
preparation and review of Adjusted EBITDA and the Audited Financial
Statements as they relate to the determination of Adjusted EBITDA (including
Seller's calculation of Closing Adjusted EBITDA), no disagreement by Buyer or
final determination by the Accounting Arbitrator as set forth below shall
introduce judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies that are inconsistent
with those consistently employed by the Seller provided that the Seller's
applicable methods, policies, principles, practice procedures, classifications
or estimation methodologies are in compliance with GAAP.

(c) The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert, and not as an
arbitrator, to determine only those issues still in dispute between Buyer and
Seller and shall consider only those matters set forth in the written notice
of disagreement upon which Buyer and Seller have disagreed and shall be
required to resolve the matters. In submitting a dispute to the Accounting
Arbitrator, each of Buyer and Seller shall concurrently furnish, at its own
expense, to the Accounting Arbitrator and the other Party such documents
and information as the Accounting Arbitrator may request. Each of Buyer and
Seller may also furnish to the Accounting Arbitrator such other information
and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all
such documents and information being concurrently given to the other Party.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have or conduct any communication with the
Accounting Arbitrator without the other Party's either being present or
receiving a concurrent copy of any written or email communication.

  



  

(d) The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve each item of disagreement
based solely upon the presentations and supporting material provided by the
Parties (the foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Accounting Arbitrator
from determining proper application of or the terms of this Agreement with
respect to the subject matter of the objections and disagreement between the
Parties). The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a detailed written report
that sets forth the resolution of all items in dispute and that contains a
final calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Such report shall be final and binding
upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred
in connection with the determination of the disputed items by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in an amount proportionate to
the dollar amount contested and not awarded to such Party as a percentage of
the total dollar amount contested by the Parties, as determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator. Each Party shall cooperate fully with the
Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to all requests for
information or access to documents or personnel made by the
Accounting Arbitrator or by the other Party, all with the intent to fairly
and in good faith resolve all disputes relating to the Adjusted EBITDA as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

  



  

(e) Upon the final determination of the Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to
this _Section 2.2_ , if the final Adjusted EBITDA is less than the lower of
the Adjusted EBITDA Threshold or the Closing Adjusted EBITDA then, the Seller
will pay to the Buyer the amount of the difference thereof (without, for the
avoidance of doubt, the application of any multiple) within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination thereof.

  



    

-18-

--- 

    



  

(f) The process set forth in this _Section 2.2_ shall be the
exclusive remedy (except in the case of fraud) for the Buyer Group for any
disputes related to items reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA but only to the
extent any Loss subject to a claim under _Section 9.1(a)_ or _ARTICLE III_
would result in duplicative recovery for the same Loss.

  



  

2.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Parties agree that the
Purchase Price, increased by the Assumed Liabilities and other relevant
items, shall be allocated for Income Tax purposes as between Seller, Barnes
Canada, Barnes China and Barnes Mexico in accordance with the methodology set
forth in _Exhibit G_ (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). The Parties further
agree to file all Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule and to not take any position for Income Tax purposes that
is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable Law.

  



  

2.4 _Consent of Third Parties_.

  



  

(a) For each Transferred Contract and Transferred Permit where
consent of a third party is required for assignment but such consent is not
received prior to Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(which shall not include the payment of any consent fees) to obtain the
consent and approval of such third party to such Transferred Contract or
Transferred Permit, as applicable, to novate the Seller Group's obligations
and rights to the Buyer Group (as directed by Buyer), so that Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as directed by Buyer) is
substituted for the Seller Group under such Transferred Contract
or Transferred Permit, as applicable, and the Seller Group is relieved of all
further obligations and rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
(x) require Seller to seek a novation or consent for assignment of a
Transferred Contract or Transferred Permit where such Transferred Contract or
Transferred Permit does not require consent, or (y) constitute an assignment
or novation of any Transferred Contract or Transferred Permit if the
attempted assignment or novation thereof without consent of the third
party thereto would constitute a breach thereof or would be ineffective with
respect to any party to such Transferred Contract or Transferred Permit (an "
_Unassignable Contract_ "). 

  



  

(b) With respect to any Unassignable Contract, Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer)
shall be deemed such member of the Seller Group's agent for purpose of
completing, fulfilling and discharging all of such member of the Seller
Group's liabilities thereunder. The provisions of this _Section 2.4_ shall in
no way limit the obligation of Seller pursuant to this Agreement to seek such
consents prior to the Closing. Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer) when
received all monies received by the Seller Group under any
Transferred Contract net of any costs of collection relating thereto.

  



  

(c) To the extent that any such consents and waivers are not
obtained, or until the impediments to such assignment are resolved,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not include the
payment of any consent fees) to (i) provide to Buyer (or, as applicable,
another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer), at the request of
Buyer, the benefits of any such Transferred Contract or Transferred Permit to
the extent related to the Business, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and
lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer) and
(iii) enforce, at the request of and for the account of Buyer, any rights of
the Seller Group arising from any such Transferred Contract or
Transferred Permit against any third Person (including any Governmental
Authority) including the right to elect to terminate in accordance with the
terms thereof. Buyer (or, as applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as
designated by Buyer) shall perform, at its sole expense and liability, on
behalf of the Seller Group and for the benefit of any third Person (including
any Governmental Authority) the obligations of the Seller Group under each
Transferred Contract and Transferred Permit or in connection therewith.

  



    

-19-

--- 

    



  

(d) It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, so long as Seller uses its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer as contemplated by
this _Section 2.4_ , Seller will not have any liability or obligation to
Buyer if any consent is not obtained or if Buyer is not able to obtain the
benefits referred to above, and Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates with respect to any third party claims arising from Seller's
compliance with the obligations set forth herein.

  



  

2.5 _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing,
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices,
assumptions and such other reasonable instruments, and shall take such
further commercially reasonable actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to
fully and effectively transfer, assign and convey unto Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer) and
their respective successors or assigns, the Transferred Assets and to
effectively assign unto Buyer (or, as applicable, another member of the Buyer
Group as designated by Buyer) and their successors and assigns, the
Assumed Liabilities and, subject to any Permitted Liens, to put Buyer (or, as
applicable, another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer) in
actual possession thereof, including (i) transferring back to Seller any
asset or liability not contemplated by this Agreement to be a Transferred
Asset or an Assumed Liability (including any Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability), respectively, which asset or liability was transferred to Buyer
Group at the Closing, and (ii) transferring to Buyer (or, as applicable,
another member of the Buyer Group as designated by Buyer) any asset or
liability contemplated by this Agreement to be a Transferred Asset or an
Assumed Liability, respectively, which was not transferred to Buyer Group at
the Closing.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
 ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE

  



  

3.1 _Pre-Closing Calculation_. No less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
written statement (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ") setting forth Seller's
good faith estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital calculated in
accordance with the methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.1_ (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") and, based thereon, a good faith estimate
of the Working Capital Excess Amount (the " _Estimated Working Capital Excess
Amount_ ") or the Working Capital Deficiency Amount (the " _Estimated Working
Capital Deficiency Amount_ "), as the case may be. To the extent that the
Estimated Net Working Capital results in an Estimated Working Capital Excess
Amount, the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing will be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such Working Capital Excess Amount.
To the extent the Estimated Net Working Capital results in an Estimated
Working Capital Deficiency Amount, the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing
will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such Working
Capital Deficiency Amount. The Purchase Price as calculated pursuant to this
_Section 3.1_ is referred to as the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ".

3.2 _Post-Closing Calculation_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a balance sheet of the Business together with a
statement of the Closing Net Working Capital calculated in accordance with the
methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.1_ and, as applicable, the Working
Capital Excess Amount or Working Capital Deficiency Amount (the " _Statement
of Closing Net Working Capital_ ") as of the Closing Date and a copy of all
work papers relating to the preparation of the Statement of Closing Net
Working Capital in a manner consistent with _Schedule 1.1_ , including the
sample balance sheet attached thereto. The Statement of Closing Net Working
Capital shall be based upon the books and records of the Seller Group and the
Business. The Buyer, and any accountants or advisors retained by Buyer, shall
be permitted access to the books and records of Seller and to the personnel
familiar with the preparation of the Preliminary Statement for the purposes of
preparing the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, in each case during
normal business hours with reasonable advance notice. The Seller, and any
accountants or advisors retained by Seller, shall be permitted access to the
books and records of Buyer and to the personnel familiar with the
preparation of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital for the purposes
of reviewing the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, in each case
during normal business hours with reasonable advance notice. The Parties agree
that the sole purpose of preparing the Statement of Closing Net Working
Capital and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_  is to measure the changes in Net Working Capital, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies that are inconsistent with the
methodology and the Closing Net Working Capital example set forth on _Schedule
1.1_.

  



  

(b) The Statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall be final and
binding on the Parties unless Seller shall, within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, deliver to Buyer
written notice of any disagreement with the Statement of Closing Net Working
Capital, which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement. If
Seller raises any objections within the aforesaid thirty (30) day period,
then Seller and Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve the
disputed matter. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all disagreements
within thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of a written notice of
disagreement, then within ten (10) days thereafter, Seller and/or Buyer shall
submit such items that remain in dispute for resolution to Deloitte and Touche
LLP, or if Deloitte and Touche LLP is not available or does not accept the
engagement, then another mutually acceptable nationally recognized accounting
firm (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ").

  



  

(c) The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert, and not as an
arbitrator, to determine only those issues still in dispute between Buyer and
Seller and shall consider only those matters set forth in the written notice
of disagreement upon which Buyer and Seller have disagreed and shall be
required to resolve the matters in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. In submitting a dispute to the Accounting Arbitrator, each of
Buyer and Seller shall concurrently furnish, at its own expense, to the
Accounting Arbitrator and the other Party such documents and information as
the Accounting Arbitrator may request. Each of Buyer and Seller may also
furnish to the Accounting Arbitrator such other information and documents as
it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other Party. Neither Buyer nor
Seller shall have or conduct any communication with the Accounting Arbitrator
without the other Party's either being present or receiving a concurrent copy
of any written or email communication.

(d) The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve each item of
disagreement based solely on the presentations and supporting material
provided by the Parties (the foregoing, however, shall not preclude the
Accounting Arbitrator from determining proper application of or the terms of
this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of the objections and
disagreement between the Parties). The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a
detailed written report that sets forth the resolution of all items in dispute
and that contains a final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital. Such
report shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in connection with the determination of
the disputed items by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne by Seller and
Buyer in an amount proportionate to the dollar amount contested and not
awarded to such Party as a percentage of the total dollar amount contested by
the Parties, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator. Each Party shall
cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis
to all requests for information or access to documents or personnel made by
the Accounting Arbitrator or by the other Party, all with the intent to fairly
and in good faith resolve all disputes relating to the Statement of Closing
Net Working Capital as promptly as reasonably practicable.

  



  

(e) Upon the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ , the Purchase Price shall be
recalculated taking into account the final calculations of Closing Net
Working Capital, Working Capital Excess Amount and Working Capital
Deficiency Amount. To the extent such final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Seller shall remit to Buyer
in immediately available funds the amount of such deficiency. To the extent
the final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, within
five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Buyer shall remit to Seller in immediately available
funds the amount of such excess.

  



  

(f) The process sets forth in this _Section 3.2_ shall be the
exclusive remedy for the Parties for any disputes related to items
required to be reflected on the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital or,
included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, but only to the
extent any Loss subject to a claim under _Section 9.1(a)_ or Article II would
result in a duplicative recovery for the same Loss.

assumed by any member of the Buyer Group, as applicable, pursuant to the
Employee Matters Agreement provides for a deferral of compensation that could

shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish to the representatives of Buyer such
additional financial and operating data and other material information
regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as Buyer may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such furnishing of
information shall be conducted during normal business hours, and in such a
manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Business;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any requests by Buyer for such furnishing
of information shall be made in writing to Seller's General Counsel (such

other, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, allow Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective representatives, reasonable access to the
Books and Records and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or

calculate and verify the amounts set forth in the preparation of Seller's Tax
Returns and to facilitate the investigation, litigation, defense and final
disposition of any Proceedings that may have been or may be made against any
Party or its Affiliates. Each Party shall be entitled to recover its out-of-
pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred in providing such Books and
Records to the other Party. All such information accessed by Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective representatives shall be considered to be
included in the definition of "Confidential Information" and governed by
_Section 6.14_. Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in confidence all
confidential information identified as such by, and obtained after the

any of its Affiliates that is reasonably necessary for Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to exercise its rights or satisfy and perform its covenants
and obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, in
each case shall not be deemed to be confidential information. If Buyer or any
of its Affiliates is requested or required by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or other documents in legal
proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or any other similar
process, pursuant to the applicable rules of any stock exchange or self
regulatory organization on which Buyer or any of its Affiliates lists
securities or pursuant to any applicable Law, to disclose any confidential
information, then Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt written notice of
such request or requirement so that Seller may seek a protective order or
other remedy in respect of such disclosure. If such a protective order or
other remedy is not obtained by or is not available to Seller, then Buyer and
its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that only
the minimum portion of such confidential information that is legally required
to be disclosed is so disclosed, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment shall be given to such confidential information. In addition, the
Parties agree that confidential information may only be used for the purpose
for which it was supplied.

  



  

(d) Each Party agrees to consult in good faith and cooperate with
the other Party and its representatives, advisors and employees, including by

regular closing schedule and procedures.

  



  

(e) From the date hereof until the date which is 30 days from the
date hereof (provided that Seller has complied with its obligations under
this _Section 6.4(e)_ ), upon reasonable advance notice from the Buyer,
Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to permit Buyer and its
environmental consultant, at mutually agreed upon dates and times, to have
reasonable nonexclusive access to the properties listed on _Schedule 6.4(e)_
and to the extent of any such leased property, the portion of the property to
which Seller or its Subsidiary has the right to occupy or access (subject to
the last sentence of this _Section 6.4(e)_ , " _Phase I Properties_ "), for
the limited purpose of undertaking, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, ASTM
E1527-05 Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and all other comparable
environmental site assessments (together, subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 6.4(e)_ , the " _Phase I Assessments_ "), provided however,
Buyer and its environmental consultant shall not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries or undertake any invasive or
destructive testing on the Phase I Properties and, provided further that
Buyer agrees to provide, prior to Closing, copies of all reports prepared by
Buyer's environmental consultant on the Phase I Properties. Notwithstanding
the list of Phase I Properties on _Schedule 6.4(e)_ , if after Seller's
commercially reasonable efforts, Buyer and its environmental consultant
are not allowed reasonable access to any Leased Real Properties by any such
Leased Real Properties' lessors and are not able to complete Phase I
Assessments for any of such Leased Real Properties, then such Leased Real
Properties shall not be deemed to be Phase I Properties. Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with any environmental consultant engaged by
Buyer in order to timely complete the Phase I Assessments. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in order to be included as a Phase I
Assessment, a Phase I Assessment must be completed within thirty (30) days of
the date hereof (provided that Seller has complied with its obligations under
this _Section 6.4(e)_ ) and any Phase I Property with respect to any such
Phase I Assessment that is not completed in such thirty (30) day period
(provided that Seller has complied with its obligations under this
_Section 6.4(e)_ ) shall no longer be deemed a Phase I Property.

the right to update the Disclosure Letter (the " _Updated Schedules_ ") but
only with respect to a matter arising after the date hereof but prior to the
Closing and which, to the Seller's Knowledge, did not exist in such condition
as of the date hereof, which would result in the condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(c)_ not being satisfied. If Buyer receives such
Updated Schedules from Seller, then Buyer shall have the right to (a)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(i) _within five (5)
Business Days of receipt thereof, or (b) proceed with the Closing, provided
that upon the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all claims
against Seller, including all indemnity claims pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , for
all such matters set forth in such Updated Schedules.

Seller or any of its Affiliates of the stock, business or assets of any
Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in Seller Competitive
Activities, and the continuation of such Seller Competitive Activities
following such acquisition shall not be in breach of the terms of this
_Section 6.6_ if: the portion of the revenues of such Person and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the fiscal year ending prior to
the date of such acquisition that is attributable to Seller Competitive
Activities by such Person and its subsidiaries (" _Seller Competitive
Revenues_ ") account for less than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues of
such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such fiscal
year; and, reasonably promptly after the acquisition thereof, Seller offers,
or causes its Affiliates to offer the portion of such business or assets that
represent Seller Competitive Activities to Buyer and negotiates in good faith
with Buyer as to the terms and conditions of Buyer's purchase of such business
and assets, provided that (A) if Buyer notifies Seller in writing that it is
unwilling to purchase such business or assets, or (B) if following such good
faith negotiations, the Parties are unable to reach agreements on the terms
of such a purchase, Seller promptly uses its commercially reasonable efforts
to sell such business or assets, including by actively marketing the business
or assets on commercially reasonable terms, but, in any event, causes such
sale within twelve (12) months of the acquisition thereof.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ will restrict or prevent Seller or
any of its Affiliates from maintaining and/or undertaking passive investments
in Persons primarily engaged in Seller Competitive Activities so long as the
aggregate interest represented by such investments does not exceed five
percent (5%) of any class of the outstanding equity or debt securities of any
such Person.

  



  

6.7 _Covenant Not to Solicit_. During the Restricted Period,
Seller will not and will not permit any of its Affiliates to hire or
engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or engage or enter
into any business relationship with (a) any of the officers or management
employees of the Business as of the date hereof, (b) any sales, sales support
or sales management employee of the Business as of the date hereof, or (c)
any direct report to the President of the Business as of the date hereof.
Nothing in this  _Section 6.7_ prevents Seller and its Affiliates from (i)
general solicitations that are not directed specifically to these employees
(but the hiring of any of these employees of the Business is still prohibited
unless the prior written consent of Buyer has been obtained) or (ii) hiring
any employee whose employment was terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates.

  



  

6.8 _Enforcement_. 

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that the covenants in _Section 6.6_ impose a
reasonable restraint on Seller and its Affiliates in light of the activities
and operations of the Business on the date of the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) the provisions of
_Sections 6.6_ , _6.7_ and _6.14_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Buyer, (ii) any breach by Seller of any of
its covenants contained in any of _Sections 6.6_ , _6.7_ or _6.14_ would
result in irreparable injury to Buyer, the exact amount of which may be
difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain or estimate, and (iii) the
remedies at law for any such breach may not be reasonable or adequate
compensation to Buyer for such breach. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if Seller, directly or indirectly, breaches any
of its covenants or obligations under any of _Sections 6.6_ , _6.7_ or _6.14_
, then, in addition to any other remedy which may be available to Buyer at
law or in equity, Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
against the breaching Party, without posting bond or other security, and
without the necessity of proving actual or threatened damage or harm.

(c) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of _Section 6.6_ or _Section 6.7_ is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closer to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  



  

6.9 _Agreements Regarding Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) To the extent that any real and personal property Taxes are
imposed on the Transferred Assets for a Straddle Period, such Taxes (to the
extent not included in the Closing Net Working Capital) shall be prorated
between the Seller Group and the Buyer Group pursuant to this _Section
6.9(a)_ in the following manner: the amount apportioned to the Seller Group
shall be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in such Straddle Period; and the amount not
apportioned to the Seller Group in the foregoing shall be apportioned to Buyer
Group. If any such Tax was not included in the Closing Net Working Capital,
the Seller Group shall pay its apportioned amount to the Buyer within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Tax bill for such Straddle Period. All refunds
of real and personal property Taxes received with respect to the
Transferred Assets apportioned to a Party pursuant to this Section 6.9(a)
shall be the property of such Party, and any such refunds received by the
other Party shall be remitted to the Party within ten (10) business days of
receipt by such other Party.

  



  

(b) Any applicable sales, use, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, real
property transfer or similar Taxes that are, or become due and payable as a
result of the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller. The Parties will timely
cooperate with each other in minimizing the amount of any Transfer Taxes to
the extent permitted by applicable Law (including the provision of any
information or preparation of any documentation that may be necessary or
useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any
such Transfer Taxes). To the extent permitted under subsection 167(1) of Part
IX of the Canadian Excise Tax Act, section 75 of the Quebec Sales Tax Act, and
any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or
territorial legislation imposing a similar value added or multi-staged Tax,
the applicable member of the Buyer Group and Barnes Canada shall jointly elect
that no Tax be payable with respect to the purchase and sale of Transferred
Assets by Barnes Canada under this Agreement. The applicable member of the
Buyer Group and Barnes Canada shall make such election(s) in prescribed form
containing prescribed information and the applicable member of the
Buyer Group shall, on a timely basis, file such election(s) in compliance
with the requirements of the applicable legislation. Buyer shall indemnify
and save harmless Barnes Canada from and against any such Tax imposed on
Barnes Canada as a result of any failure or refusal by any Governmental
Authority to accept any such election.

(c) In accordance with the requirements of the Canadian Income Tax
Act, the regulations thereunder, the administrative practice and policy of
the Canada Revenue Agency and any applicable equivalent or corresponding
provincial or territorial legislative, regulatory and administrative
requirements, applicable member of the Buyer Group and Barnes Canada shall
make and file, in a timely manner a joint election(s) to have the rules in
section 22 of the Canadian Income Tax Act, and any equivalent or corresponding
provision under applicable provincial or territorial tax legislation, apply
in respect of the debts of Barnes Canada that are the subject of
such election, and shall designate therein that portion of the Purchase Price
and Assumed Liabilities allocated to such debts in accordance with the
procedures set out in Section 2.3 of this Agreement as the consideration paid
by the applicable member of the Buyer Group to Barnes Canada. The applicable
member of the Buyer Group and Barnes Canada shall prepare and file their
respective Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such election.

  



  

(d) In accordance with the requirements of the Canadian Income Tax
Act, the regulations thereunder, the administrative practice and policy of

provincial or territorial legislative, regulatory and administrative
requirements, the applicable member of the Buyer Group and Barnes Canada shall
make and file, in a timely manner a joint election(s) to have the rules in
subsection 20(24) of the Canadian Income Tax Act, and any equivalent or
corresponding provision under applicable provincial or territorial Tax
legislation, apply to the obligations of Barnes Canada in respect of
undertakings which arise from the operation of the Business and to which
paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Canadian Income Tax Act applies. Buyer and Barnes
Canada acknowledge that Barnes Canada is transferring assets to the applicable
member of the Buyer Group which have a value equal to the elected amount as
consideration for the assumption by the applicable member of the Buyer Group
of such obligations of Barnes Canada. The applicable member of the Buyer
Group and Barnes Canada shall prepare and file their respective Income
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such election.

  



  

6.10 _Certain Real Property Matters_.

  



  

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall reimburse Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries, as designated by Seller prior to Closing, in immediately
available funds for an amount equal to the total of any and all security
deposit monies then being held by the landlords under each
Lease (collectively, the " _Lease Deposits_ ") to the extent any such amounts
are not included in the Closing Net Working Capital. In the event that any
landlord under a Lease holds a letter of credit or other similar instrument
(each, a " _Lease Security Instrument_ ") as security for performance of the
tenant's obligations under such Lease, Buyer shall promptly and, in any
event, within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, cause each and
every such Lease Security Instrument to be canceled and returned to Seller.
Seller shall deliver a written description of each Lease Deposit and Lease
Security Instrument to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to

advertising media of any type (collectively, the " _Seller Signage_ ")
relating to the Seller Group or containing any intellectual property of the
Seller Group other than the rights of the Seller Group (if any) which were
transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any damage to the Seller Signage
in connection with the removal of same, and following such removal, Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller of such removal and deliver all such Seller
Signage to Seller at such location as may be specified by Seller, unless
Seller provides a written request to Buyer for Buyer to promptly destroy such
Seller Signage and dispose of same in accordance with applicable Law.

(c) Seller has provided Buyer with its most recent surveys, title
policies and title reports, which relate to the Owned Real Property and are
in Seller's possession and control. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in connection with ordering and obtaining updated surveys and title

therewith, for each Owned Real Property at or prior to Closing. All survey
and title policy charges, including any endorsements thereto, and any loan
policies and endorsements required by Buyer's lender, if any, shall be at
Buyer's sole cost and expense.

  



  

(d) Immediately following the Closing (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date), the applicable member of
the Seller Group shall deliver written notice to the landlord under the China
Lease terminating the China Lease as of the earliest possible date. The
Seller shall be responsible for causing the applicable member of the Seller
Group to pay all costs and expenses related to the termination of the China
Lease. The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for any such costs and expenses
including the termination fee and any liquidated damages and expenses
rightfully charged by the landlord under the China Lease, in cash,
promptly following receipt by the Buyer of written documentation therefor,
including, from the landlord under the China Lease detailing such termination
fee. The Seller shall take, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
take, all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize all such
damages, fees and expenses of the China Lease.

  



  

6.11 _Buyer Non Solicit_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
(i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date which is one hundred eighty (180) days
after the date this Agreement is terminated as set forth in _ARTICLE X_ below,
Buyer will not and will cause each of its Subsidiaries not to employ or
solicit for employment the following: (a) any of the officers or management
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries with whom Buyer has had direct
contact as a result of its consideration of a possible transaction, or
(b) any sales, sales support or sales management employee of the Business or
any direct report to the President of the Business; provided, however, that
the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to the employment or solicitation
for employment of any of the foregoing Persons pursuant to the Employee
Matters Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ prevents Buyer from (i)
general solicitations that are not directed specifically to these employees
(but the hiring of any of these employees other than pursuant to the
Employee Matters Agreement is still prohibited unless the prior written
consent of Seller has been obtained) or (ii) hiring any employee whose
employment was terminated by Seller.

  



  

6.12 _Assumption of Remaining Canadian Obligations_. From and after
the Closing Date and conditional upon Closing, the Buyer agrees to pay,
satisfy and be responsible for the Remaining Canadian Obligations.

  



    

\- 49 -

6.13 _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until termination of this
Agreement (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), Seller will not (and will instruct
its representatives, investment bankers and any other person acting on its
behalf, not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate submission
of any proposals or offers from any corporation, partnership, person or group
relating to any acquisition, purchase or option to purchase all or
substantially all of the assets of the Business (a " _Competitive Transaction_
"), (ii) engage in any negotiations or discussions with respect to any such
Competitive Transaction or (iii) furnish any information with respect to a
Competitive Transaction to any person or any entity. Seller agrees that any
discussions or negotiations with any potential acquirer of the Business with
respect to any Competitive Transaction that are in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall cease during the Exclusivity Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller may respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding a
Competitive Transaction by indicating that it is subject to an exclusivity
agreement and is unable to provide any information relating to the Business
or entertain any proposals or engage in negotiations or discussions during the
Exclusivity Period. Further notwithstanding the foregoing, a Competitive
Transaction shall not include an offer, proposal or transaction regarding a
sale of Seller or its assets not specifically relating primarily to the
Business.

  



  

6.14 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that, through its
ownership and/or management of the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Remaining Canadian Obligations and the Business, Seller and
other members of the Seller Group have occupied positions of trust and
confidence with respect to the Business and have had access to and become
familiar and will continue to have access until the Closing with confidential
and proprietary information relating to the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Remaining Canadian Obligations and the Business
(collectively the " _Confidential Information_ "), including: (i)
customer and supplier lists, target customer information, current and
anticipated customer requirements, price lists, market studies and business
plans; (ii) research and development plans, activities and results; (iii)
Intellectual Property; (iv) historical and projected sales data, financial
data and projections, capital spending budgets and operating budgets; (v)
employee personnel files; and (vi) environmental studies, reports, and
analyses, and any related regulatory filings or submissions, including
summaries, memoranda, reports, compilations or other derivations thereof.

  



  

(b) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the protection of the
Confidential Information is necessary to protect and preserve the value of
the Transferred Assets and the Business, and that without such protection,
Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement and consummated the
Transactions. Accordingly, subject to the provisions of Section 6.14(c),
Seller hereby covenants and agrees, for itself and its Subsidiaries and their
successors and permitted assigns, that, following the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, disclose to
any Person or use for its own account or benefit or for the account or benefit
of any other Person any Confidential Information.

(c) The provisions of _Section 6.14(b)_ shall not apply to information
(i) that is in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this
Agreement; (ii) information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to any
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or other documents
in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or any other
similar process, pursuant to the applicable rules of any stock exchange or
self regulatory organization on which Seller or any of its Affiliates lists
securities, or pursuant to any applicable Law, or (iii) disclosed by Seller
that is reasonably necessary for Seller to exercise its rights or satisfy and
perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements. If any member of the Seller Group is requested or
required by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or other
documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or any
other similar process, pursuant to the applicable rules of any stock exchange
or self regulatory organization on which Seller or any of its Affiliates lists
securities or pursuant to any applicable Law, to disclose any Confidential
Information, then Seller shall provide Buyer with prompt written notice of
such request or requirement so that Buyer may seek a protective order or
other remedy in respect of such disclosure. If such a protective order or
other remedy is not obtained by or is not available to Buyer, then Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that only the minimum
portion of such Confidential Information that is legally required to be
disclosed is so disclosed, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment shall be given to
such Confidential Information.

  



  

6.15 _Financial Statements and Additional Financial Information_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer true, correct
and complete copies of the audited financial statements of the Business as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2012, together with notes relating
thereto, all prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X and in accordance
with GAAP in a manner consistent with the Seller's 2012 audited financial
statements (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ") and accompanied by the
report of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Auditor_ ").  In addition, if
the Closing occurs on or after May 15, 2013, then Seller also will deliver
prior to the Closing unaudited interim financial statements for the periods
required by Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X, including the comparable prior
year period (the " _Unaudited Interim Period Financial Statements_ " and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Historical Financial
Statements_ "). The Historical Financial Statements shall be prepared at
Seller's sole expense and shall comply with all of the requirements of
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act and as applicable to
Buyer.

  



  

(b) Upon Buyer's reasonable request reasonably prior to the delivery
date thereof, no later than within 60 days after the Closing or, if earlier,
15 days prior to the filing deadline for any periodic report under the
Exchange Act, Seller will deliver to Buyer such additional financial
information (the "Additional Financial Statements"), prepared at Buyer's
sole expense and necessary to prepare pro forma financial statements required
by Article 11 of Regulation S-X or necessary to prepare financial statement
disclosures required by ASC 805-10-50-2(h).

  



  

(c) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer at Buyer's sole expense with
respect to any reasonable request in connection with the obligations of Buyer
to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Historical
Financial Statements and the Additional Financial Information, including by
requesting, in conjunction with Buyer, that the Auditor provide customary
consents, comfort letters and documents that may be required or reasonably
necessary.

(d) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller with respect to any reasonable
request in connection with the obligations of Seller pursuant to this 
_Section 6.15_.

  



  

6.16 _Post-Closing Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after Closing, Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in order to make available to Buyer any insurance coverage carried by
Seller in relation to the Assumed Liabilities which covers occurrences prior
to Closing (the " _Seller Policies_ "), whether or not claims relating to
such occurrences are made prior to or after the Closing. In the event of an
occurrence for which coverage may be available under one or more Seller
Policies, Seller shall, after consultation with and at the reasonable
request of Buyer, submit a claim for such occurrence to the appropriate
insurer under the applicable Seller Policy (such claim, a " _Covered Claim_
"). Seller further agrees to (i) provide such commercially reasonable
assistance as Buyer may require in order to determine whether a claim is a
Covered Claim and (ii) if it is a Covered Claim, use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue such Covered Claim with the applicable insurer (including,
if necessary, acting as the direct contact for all purposes with such insurer
and using commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such Covered Claim on
behalf of and subject to the reasonable direction of Buyer). __ In
consideration thereof, Buyer shall be responsible for paying, and shall
reimburse Seller for, (A) all out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by
Seller and its Subsidiaries in providing such assistance (including, a
reasonable charge for wages, salaries, benefits or other overhead expenses
associated with the Seller's own employees in connection with any such
Covered Claim) and (B) any letter of credit fees, actuarial fees and other
expenses incurred in connection with maintaining from and after the Closing
any such Seller Policies with respect to any such Assumed Liabilities or
pursuing any Covered Claims, which payments in each case shall be made to
Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days of Buyer's receipt from Seller of a
written invoice therefor (together with such supporting documentation as Buyer
may reasonably request). For purposes of the foregoing, the liability
associated with a Covered Claim, to the extent covered by a Seller Policy,
shall be deemed to be an Excluded Liability hereunder solely to the extent
necessary to effectively file claims under any such Seller Policy and only to
the extent coverage is actually provided, it being acknowledged and agreed
that any such matter shall not be an Excluded Liability hereunder for any
other purpose (and shall remain for all such purposes an Assumed Liability)
including with respect to the indemnification provided in _ARTICLE IX_ hereof
for which Seller shall have no liability (other than to the extent of
Seller's obligation to remit proceeds to the Buyer from such Seller Policies
to the extent set forth in  _Section 6.16(b))._

  



  

(b) Seller shall promptly remit to the Buyer any recovery Seller
obtains under any Seller Policy with respect to a Covered Claim to which the
Buyer is entitled pursuant to _Section 6.16(a)_ other than to the extent (i)
the proceeds of such Covered Claim are otherwise used by Seller or its
Subsidiaries to repair the loss or destruction or settle the liability giving
rise to such Covered Claim prior to or after the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement, (ii) Seller has indemnified Buyer with respect to such
matter hereunder (without giving effect to the limitations in _ARTICLE IX)_
or (iii) such loss, destruction or liability is otherwise included in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital in amounts greater than the amounts
reflected in the Net Working Capital Target, if any.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be responsible for paying,
and shall reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries for, (i) any
applicable deductible or self-insured retention amount actually payable with
respect to any such Covered Claims, (ii) any amounts in excess of the
coverage provided by such Seller Policies, and (iii) all defense costs
incurred by Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith, which
payments (to the extent payable to Seller) shall be made to Seller within
fifteen (15) Business Days of Buyer's receipt from Seller of a written
invoice therefor (together with such supporting documentation as Buyer may
reasonably request). Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with any issuer of a Seller Policy and comply with the
requirements thereof in connection with any such Covered Claims. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be deemed an assignment of any
Seller Policy, and the Seller shall retain all of its rights under the Seller
Policies. The provisions of this Section are only for administrative
purposes. Seller does not ensure that any such Seller Policies shall be
available to Buyer or cover any such Assumed Liabilities nor shall Seller
shall have any liability if any such insurer fails to cover or limits coverage
of any such Covered Claim.

9.2 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All representations
and warranties in this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement shall expire on
the fifteen (15)-month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that the representations and warranties in _Sections 4.1 (Corporate
Existence)_ , _4.2 (Authorization of Transaction)_ , _4.4 (Finders; Brokers)_
,  _4.5 (Title to Assets)_ , _4.11 (Tax Matters)_ , _5.1 (Corporate
Existence)_ , _5.2 (Authorization of Transaction)_ ,  _5.4 (Finders;
Brokers)_ and _5.7 (Due Diligence and Independent Investigation)_ shall
survive until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the
sections set forth in this _Section 9.2_ , the " _Fundamental Representations_
"). The covenants, agreements or obligations of the Parties in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements shall survive the Closing and expire at such
time as such covenants, agreements or obligations have been fully performed or
satisfied. Any cause of action for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, failure
or breach of a representation or warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement shall expire and terminate
unless the Party claiming that such inaccuracy, misrepresentation, failure or
breach occurred delivers to the appropriate Indemnifying Party written notice
and a reasonably detailed explanation of the alleged inaccuracy,
misrepresentation, failure or breach on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern time, on
the date on which such representation or warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation expires pursuant to this _Section 9.2_. If any claim
for indemnification or other recovery is timely asserted pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to bring an action,
suit or proceeding with respect to such claim within one (1) year after first
giving the Indemnifying Party notice thereof, but may not bring such action,
suit or proceeding thereafter.

  



  

9.3 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) If any Indemnitee shall believe that such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1_ in respect of any Losses
pursuant to a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnitee shall give the
appropriate indemnifying Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice
within ten (10) Business Days of its becoming aware of such Third Party Claim,
which notice shall specify in reasonably sufficient detail the facts alleged
to give rise to a claim for indemnification and the amount the Indemnitee
seeks hereunder from Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure
to give such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its
obligations under this _ARTICLE IX_ , provided this written notice is given
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period specified in
_Section 9.2_ for the relevant representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, or obligation and the interests of the Indemnifying Party have not
been prejudiced by the failure.

  



    

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) In connection with any claim for which indemnification has been
sought under this _ARTICLE IX_ resulting from or arising out of any claim or
Proceeding against an Indemnitee by a Person that is not a Party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim (unless such Indemnitee elects not to seek
indemnity hereunder for such Third Party Claim), upon receipt of the written
notice given pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_. If the Indemnifying Party shall
have assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with this
_Section 9.3(b)_, then the Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to settle,
or consent to the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party
Claim, without the prior written consent of such Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness thereof; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of any Indemnitee or to
agree to any restriction that would apply to any Indemnitee or to its conduct
of business; and _provided_ , _further_ , that a condition to any such
settlement shall be a complete release of such Indemnitee and its Affiliates,
officers, employees, consultants and agents with respect to such Third Party
Claim. Each Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in (but not control)
the defense of any such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its
own expense. The Indemnifying Parties shall select counsel and consultants of
recognized standing and competence and shall diligently pursue the resolution
of such Third Party Claim. Each Indemnitee shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates, officers, employees, consultants and agents to, cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim being
defended by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.3_. The
assumption of any defense hereunder by an Indemnifying Party shall not be
deemed an admission of responsibility for the Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section 9.3_ or the Indemnifying Party
has failed to diligently pursue such defense, as the circumstances
warrant, then the Indemnitee shall assume and defend against such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 9.3(b) _and proposes to settle such Third Party
Claim prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with respect
thereto, then the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of a
settlement or a judgment arising from a Third Party Claim unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) or (ii) a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is
entered against the Indemnitee for such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(c) Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made by the
Indemnitee (unless the Indemnifying Party has the exclusive right to settle
or compromise under _Section 9.3_) or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may
be, of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in
and in accordance with _Section 9.3_ shall also be binding upon the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee, as the case may be, in the same manner
as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise.

  



  



  

9.4 _Direct Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") may be asserted by
notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give
such prompt notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its
obligations under this _ARTICLE IX_ , provided written notice is given prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period specified in _Section
9.2_ for the relevant representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or
obligation and the interests of the Indemnifying Party have not been
prejudiced by the failure. Such notice by the Indemnitee shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Losses that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) Business Days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnitee within such twenty
(20)-Business Day period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity
obligation to the Indemnitee for any Losses with respect to such claim, then
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes the assertion of a claim, then the Parties
covenant and agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
their dispute with respect to such claim.

--- 

    



  

9.5 _Subrogation and Mitigation_. To the extent that any Indemnifying
Party discharges any claim for indemnification hereunder, such
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of any Indemnitee
against third parties, including all rights relating to claims under any
insurance, contracts, common law or otherwise. Such Indemnitee (and its
Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party will execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence or further protect such subrogation rights.
The Indemnitee shall take, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
take, all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize their Losses to
the maximum extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

  



  

9.6 _Indemnification Calculations_. The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be
computed net of any insurance proceeds or other recoveries made by any
Indemnitee in connection with such Losses and net of any Tax benefits arising
by reason of any such Loss. Each Indemnitee shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and recoveries. If any
such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnitee (or any of
its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Party has
made a payment to the Indemnitee with respect thereto, then the Indemnitee (or
such Affiliate) shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
such proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
Party's payment). All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  



  

9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. With respect to the enforcement of this
Agreement prior to Closing, the Parties shall be entitled to any and all
remedies at law or in equity. After the Closing, other than (i) in cases of
fraud by any member of Seller Group or Buyer Group, (ii) rights to specific
performance and injunctive relief with respect to the covenants and agreements
set forth in _Sections 6.6_ ,  _6.7_ and _6.14_ , (iii) pursuant to _Sections
2.4_ or _3.2_ , or (iv) pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or
Transition License Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE
IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties (and all
Indemnitees) for any breach of the obligations, covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, or for any other claims or causes of actions arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the Transactions, the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Remaining Canadian
Obligations. From and after the Closing, to the extent that Buyer or any
Buyer Indemnitee, or any of their respective Affiliates has any Losses for
which it may assert any other right to indemnification, contribution or
recovery from Seller or any of its Affiliates (whether under this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or under any common law theory or any statute or other
Law), Buyer hereby waives, releases and agrees not to assert such right, and
Buyer agrees to cause each Buyer Indemnitee and their respective
Affiliates to waive, release and agree not to assert such right, regardless
of the theory upon which any claim may be based, whether statutory or common
law, contract, equity, tort, warranty, strict liability or any other theory of
liability.

  



  



  

ARTICLE X 
  
 TERMINATION

  



  

10.1 _Termination Events_. Without prejudice to other remedies which

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

  



  

(b) by Buyer or Seller, by written notice to the other if:

  



  

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the
Termination Date, unless extended by written agreement of the Parties; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
perform or comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement shall have
been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date; or

  



  

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, promulgated,
issued, entered or enforced (A) any Law prohibiting the Transactions or
making them illegal, or (B) any injunction, judgment, order or ruling or
taking any other action, in each case, permanently enjoining, restraining or
prohibiting the Transactions, which shall have become final and nonappealable.

  



  

(c) by Buyer:

  



  

(i) if the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ shall have become
incapable of fulfillment; or

  



  

(ii) if all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ shall have
been satisfied and Seller shall not have made all of the deliveries required
by _Section 8.3_ on or before the date designated for Closing pursuant to
_Section 8.1_; or

  



  

(d) by Seller:

  



  

(i) if the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3_ shall have become

(ii) if all of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ shall have
been satisfied and Buyer shall not have made all of the deliveries required
by _Section 8.2_ on or before the date designated for Closing pursuant to
_Section 8.1_.

  



  

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of any termination of
the Agreement as provided in _Section 10.1_ above, then all further
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate without
further liability on the part of any Party to the others, other than (a) with
respect to the obligations of Buyer and Seller under the Non-Disclosure
Agreement and _Sections 6.3_ , _6.11_ and _10.2_ and _ARTICLE XI_ of this
Agreement, (b) liability for any fraudulent misrepresentation in connection
with any warranty, representation, covenant or obligation given, occurring or
arising pursuant to this Agreement, including failing to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) specific performance as contemplated
in _Section 11.9_. Nothing herein nor any termination hereof shall limit the
right of the non-breaching Party to seek specific performance and all other
remedies available at law or equity. Subject to _Section 10.2(b)_ , a Party's
right to terminate this Agreement is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other legal or equitable rights or remedies which such Party may have.

  



    

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any termination
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ (other than as a result of the condition
set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_ becoming incapable of fulfillment), at Seller's
election within 10 Business Days of such termination, Buyer shall pay to
Seller within five (5) Business Days of Seller's election set forth above a
fee equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Termination Fee_
") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller as liquidated damages and, subject to the next sentence,
as Seller's sole remedy hereunder. If Seller does not elect to accept the
Termination Fee hereunder, Seller shall have the right to pursue any other
remedy to which Seller may be entitled, whether at Law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and the existence or amount of the Termination
Fee shall not be evidence of, or serve as an estimate of, Seller's damages. If
Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee and Seller commences a suit which
results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Buyer for the Termination
Fee or any portion thereof, then Buyer shall pay Seller its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit.

11.8 _Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_. The Parties agree

limitation";

  



  

(d) the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement;

  



  

(e) all terms defined in this Agreement have the defined meanings when

unless otherwise defined therein;

  



  

(f) the definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the

(n) the Party asserting a Material Adverse Effect hereunder (including
_Section 6.5_ or _Section 7.2_ ) shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

11.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any Proper Court to be illegal, void or unenforceable, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. With respect to any provision of
this Agreement finally determined by a Proper Court to be unenforceable, Buyer
and Seller hereby agree that such court shall have jurisdiction to reform
such provision so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, and the Parties agree to abide by such court's determination. If any
such provision of this Agreement cannot be reformed, such provision shall be
deemed to be severed from this Agreement, but every other provision of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

11.13 _Disclosure Letter_. Any information disclosed pursuant to a
particular section of the Disclosure Letter hereto shall be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section of the Disclosure Letter to which
it is readily apparent that such information is applicable to such section of
the Disclosure Letter and corresponding representation and warranty,
notwithstanding the omission of a cross-reference thereto. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific
item or matter in the Disclosure Letter or any schedule to any Ancillary
Agreement is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts,
or the item or matter so specified or included, or other items or matters,
are or are not material, shall not be employed as a point of reference in
determining any standard of materiality under this Agreement and no Party
shall use the fact of the specification of any such amount or the
specification or inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any item or matter is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Neither
the specification of any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in
the Disclosure Letter or any schedule to any Ancillary Agreement is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not
in the ordinary course of business and no Party shall use the fact or the
specification or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any item or matter is or is not
in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

11.14 _Language_. Seller and Buyer agree that the language used in this
Agreement is the language chosen by the Parties to express their
mutual intent, and that no rule of strict construction is to be applied
against Seller or Buyer. Each of Seller and Buyer and their
respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated the terms of this Agreement.

11.15 _Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws_. The Parties hereby waive
compliance with the provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with
respect to the sale of any or all of the Transferred Assets and the Business
to Buyer and its Affiliates; it being understood that any liabilities or
Losses arising out of the failure of any member of the Seller Group to comply
with the requirements and provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed
Liabilities or Remaining Canadian Obligations shall be treated as Excluded
Liabilities.
