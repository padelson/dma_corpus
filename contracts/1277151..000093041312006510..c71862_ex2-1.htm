 (d) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

    Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a)  _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall enter into an Exchange Agent Agreement, in form and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with a bank or trust company selected by Buyer with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to which the Exchange Agent shall act as paying agent and exchange agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration for the issued and outstanding Shares. 

  

 (b)  _Provision of Shares_. Buyer shall provide to the Exchange Agent on or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) sufficient cash to be paid for the aggregate Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation Fund") and (ii) evidence of shares of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such shares of Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock, at Buyers election) issuable pursuant to Section 2.1. 

  

 (c)  _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail to each holder of record of outstanding Shares a letter of transmittal (which shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) to be used for surrendering Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d)  _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of each Share in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay, without interest and not more than 60 days following the Effective Time, any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and have not been paid prior to such surrender, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e)  _No Liability_. None of Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement that remains unclaimed for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer, upon demand, and any holders of Shares which have not been surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for delivery of the Merger Consideration and any distributions with respect to Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock, in each case without interest thereon, subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws. Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of the date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   (f)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld therefrom with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person. 

  

 (g)  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have properly exercised, perfected and not subsequently withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Article 15 of the VSCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not have any of such Shares converted into the right to receive, or become exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration. The holders of such Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Article 15 of the VSCA unless and until such holders fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights under Article 15 of the VSCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each of such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if it had been converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as provided in Section 2.1 hereof. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make all payments required to be made under such Article 15 of the VSCA in respect of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Buyer and Acquisition Sub (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments relating to a shareholders assertion of rights of appraisal and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the VSCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquisition Sub, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 (h)  _Purchase Price Allocation_. Any time prior to ninety days after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare a schedule allocating the Merger Consideration (including assumed liabilities) among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The Parties agree not to take any position inconsistent with such schedule for Tax reporting purposes. 

  

 (i)  _Tax Reporting_. To the extent that the Company has a net capital gain for its taxable year ending on the Closing Date, it will to the extent the Company or its successor determines it to be legally permissible and pursuant to Section 857(b)(3)(C) of the Code designate as capital gain dividends the dividends that it pays during that year, the dividends that Section 858 of the Code deems it to pay during that year, or deficiency dividends under Section 860 of the Code that it pays for that year.

 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

  

 Section 5.1. _Preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement; Shareholder Meetings_.

  

 (a) Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and Acquisition Sub shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act with respect to the Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock issuable in the Merger, a portion of which Form S-4 shall also serve as the proxy statement with respect to the shareholder meeting of the Company (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the "Company Shareholders Meeting") in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of the Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall furnish all information concerning such Party, its Affiliates, directors and officers and such other matters that is required to be included in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as may be reasonably requested by another Party in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by another Party in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The respective Parties will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the Contemplated Transactions, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and its shareholders as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or Acquisition Sub in connection with such action. Except for annual, quarterly and current reports filed or furnished with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which may be incorporated by reference therein (but subject to Section 5.5), no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or mailing to the Companys shareholders or the SEC, will be made by the Company, Buyer or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, without the other Parties prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing the other Parties the opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each Party will advise the others, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Surviving Corporation Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Merger 

   for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4,
comments thereon or any other communication therefrom, and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC of its staff for additional information, and will
promptly provide the others with copies of any written communication with the
SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any such communication. Each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to Buyer, Acquisition Sub or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by Buyer, Acquisition Sub or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to (i) the Form S-4 so that it would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that it would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company.

  

 (b) The Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 has become effective for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. Except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company has effected a Change of Recommendation in compliance with Section 5.4, the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall take all lawful action to solicit such the Company Shareholder Approval, including by timely mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and soliciting proxies from its shareholders. The Company shall keep Buyer updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting: (i) after consultation with Buyer, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is required by Applicable Law is timely provided to the Companys shareholders; (ii) with the consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld), if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient Common Shares or Series A Preferred Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Company Shareholders Meeting; or (iii) with the consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld), if additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the Agreement, including the Plan of Merger. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by a Change of Recommendation.

  

 Section 5.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and shall cause each its Subsidiaries to, afford to Buyer and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of the Companys properties, books, Contracts, personnel

   and records, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Buyer (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel,
as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
require the Company to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would violate its obligations with respect to
confidentiality to a third party (if the Company has used reasonable best
efforts to obtain permission or consent of such third party to such
disclosure). Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall hold any nonpublic information
concerning the Company in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms
thereof, notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
termination hereof.

  

 Section 5.3. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Takeover Statutes; Notification_.

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to use (and the Company agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such Party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities or third parties and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger, this Agreement or the consummation of any of the other Contemplated Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any Contemplated Transaction, (i) without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation and (ii) none of the Buyer Parties shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. Buyer shall take the risk of obtaining, and shall direct the negotiations relating to, all consents, approvals, waivers or exemptions from any non-governmental third parties under the Companys loan, management and franchise agreements listed on Schedule 5.3(a) to the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Third Party Consents") (including the payment by Buyer of all fees and expenses required in connection with such loan, management and franchise agreements), and the Company shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with obtaining such Third Party Consents. In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any Third Party Consent, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Buyer, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and the Buyer and Acquisition Sub and their respective businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such Third Party Consent. 

   (b) Buyer and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the view of the other in connection with all filings made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. Buyer and the Company each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Contemplated Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. To the extent practicable, neither Buyer nor the Company shall permit any of its officers or any other of its Representatives to participate in any meeting or substantive conversations with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and Applicable Law, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. 

  

 (c) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Buyer, Acquisition Sub, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to Buyer, Acquisition Sub, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, this Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions.

  

 (d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer and Acquisition Sub, and Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (i) there is any action, claim, demand, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation of, in each case, in or before any court or administrative agency of any Governmental Entity or before any arbitrator (other than personal injury or other routine tort litigation arising in the Ordinary Course of Business), (ii) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or material adverse effect becomes untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (iii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iv) any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required under a Material Contract in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (and the Companys or Subsidiaries response); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

  

 (e) The Company shall keep Buyer and its Representatives informed of the status of, and any developments regarding, the Investigation and the Class Action, including promptly furnishing Buyer with copies of all submissions, filings and substantive correspondence (not including transmittal letters and other routine matters) received or made by the Company or its

   Representatives and responding to reasonable requests by Buyer for
information regarding the Investigation or the Class Action. The Company
shall comply with all of its obligations under the Release and
Indemnification Agreement. Buyer agrees, to the extent necessary, to execute
any confidentiality agreements governing the sharing of information and/or
documents pertaining to the Investigation or the Class Action prior to
receiving such information and/or documents.

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall promptly request that each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company within twelve months prior to the date hereof or that has not terminated in accordance with its terms in connection with that Persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that Person by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement.

   faith, (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors legal
duties under Applicable Law, and (B) after consulting with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal.

  

 (d) The Company shall notify Buyer promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the parties and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written inquiries, requests, proposals or offers, including any proposed agreements) and, thereafter, the Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Buyer.

    |  



    
     



    |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys compliance with the provisions of Section 5.4, prior
to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Board of
Directors of the Company may approve or recommend (and in connection
therewith withdraw or modify its approval of this Agreement and the Merger) a
written unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation
of this Section 5.4 that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, if and only if, (w) prior
to taking such action the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors legal duties
under Applicable Laws; (x) the Company notifies Buyer in writing at least
three Business Days in advance that it intends to take such action or that
the Company

   intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), which notice
shall specify the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and
all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach
the most current version of any proposed transaction agreement (and any
related agreements) providing for such Superior Proposal and any financing
commitments relating thereto; (y) after providing such notice and prior to
taking any such action or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(g), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate
in good faith with Buyer and Acquisition Sub during the three Business Day
period (to the extent Buyer desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or the
Limited Guaranty as would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to
take such action or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g); and
(z) following the end of the three Business Day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after
taking into account any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
and the Limited Guaranty proposed in writing by Buyer, that the Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes
proposed by Buyer were to be given effect; _provided_  that in the event such
Superior Proposal is thereafter modified by the Person making such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall provide a new written notice with respect to such
modified Superior Proposal and shall again comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.4(e).

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state laws with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to shareholders of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is an Acquisition Proposal (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or recommend (publicly or otherwise), such Acquisition Proposal) or effect a Change of Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.4(e).

  

 (g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions under any Takeover Statutes or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 7.1(g).

 Section 5.7. _Related Party Transactions_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time but after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, the Company shall (i) cause each Apple Affiliate Agreement and all other Related Party Transactions (other than the Apple Transfer Agreements) to be terminated without any payment or obligation on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be released from all liabilities or obligations arising out of or relating the Apple Affiliate Agreements and all other Related Party Transactions (other than the Apple Transfer Agreements); _provided_ that (A) any indemnification rights in favor of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives under the Apple Affiliate Agreements or other Related Party Transactions shall remain in full force and effect, and (B) the Companys indemnification obligations under the Organizational Documents of the Company and the indemnification obligations under Section 5.8 shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) the Company shall provide evidence of the foregoing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

   Corporation nor Buyer shall be obligated under this Section 5.8(a) to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to the extent
that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests
in the outcome of such action; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party unless, in connection with such legal action, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation, if and to the extent required by Applicable Law,
receive an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay
such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined under
Applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses under this Section 5.8, upon learning of any such
legal action, shall notify in writing the Surviving Corporation and Buyer,
_provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations
under this Section 5.8(a) of the Surviving Corporation and Buyer, except to
the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

  

 (b)  _Liability Coverage_. The Surviving Corporation shall obtain and maintain for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time "run-off" or "tail" director and officer liability coverage to the directors and officers of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any claim made after the Effective Time and related to any period of time prior to the Effective Time without reduction of existing coverage under, and having other terms not materially less favorable to the insured Persons than, the director and officer liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by the Company for 2012 for such insurance (the "Insurance Cap Amount") and the Company hereby represents that the amount paid for such insurance for 2012 is as set forth in Schedule 5.8(b) to the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance Cap Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Insurance Cap Amount.

The Surviving Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party or his or her heirs or his or her personal representatives in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the Merger and are in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled under the Organizational Documents of the Company. In the event that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the successors and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party covered hereby.

Buyer shall not take any action not otherwise required or expressly permitted under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result in termination of, any of the Financing Commitments. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain any such portion from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to consummate the Contemplated Transactions on terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer and Acquisition Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer) than the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, but in all cases at or prior to the Closing. Buyer shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments, of which Buyer or Acquisition Sub becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Buyer shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting the Company or, if such amendment would or would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any material respect Buyers ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

 (b) Subject to Applicable Law, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish such financial, statistical and other pertinent information and projections relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (ii) make appropriate officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries available for due diligence meetings and for participation in meetings, presentations, road shows and sessions with rating agencies and prospective sources of financing, (iii) assist Buyer and its financing sources with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents necessary, proper or advisable in

   connection with the Financing, (iv) reasonably cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and its financing sources for any Financing to be raised by
Buyer to complete the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, (v)
provide and execute documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (vi)
form new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (vii) transfer or otherwise
restructure its ownership of existing Subsidiaries, properties or other
assets, including causing any of its Subsidiaries designated by Buyer to be
converted into a limited liability company, in each case, pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and effective as of or
immediately prior to and conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time,
(viii) provide timely access to diligence materials, appropriate personnel
and properties to allow sources of financing and their representatives to
complete all due diligence, (ix) provide assistance with respect to the
review and granting of mortgages and security interests in collateral for the

reasonably satisfactory to any potential lender, (xi) cooperate in connection
with the repayment or defeasance of any existing indebtedness of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (including the defeasance
of the Hillsboro Note) including delivering such payoff, defeasance or
similar notices under any existing loans of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Buyer, and (xii) permit Buyer and its
Representatives to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering
inspections of each real estate property owned and, subject to obtaining
required third party consents with respect thereto (which the Company shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) neither Buyer nor its
Representatives shall have the right to take and analyze any samples of any
environmental media (including soil, groundwater, surface water, air or
sediment) or any building material or to perform any invasive testing
procedure on any such property, (B) Buyer shall schedule and coordinate all
inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least two
(2) Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection
that Buyer or its Representatives intend to conduct, and (C) the Company
shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times during any
such inspection); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or require the
Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, or give any
indemnities prior to the Effective Time (except those that the Company is
reimbursed for by Buyer). Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs in excess of an
aggregate of $500,000 incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
performing their obligations under this Section 5.9(b) and all out of pocket
costs in connection with the defeasance of the Hillsboro Note, but not
including any principal or interest under the Hillsboro Note or the deposit
of or payments for any defeasance securities in connection therewith, and
indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in
the event the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions are not
consummated, Buyer shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs not previously reimbursed). None of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be
deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions
taken by the Company at the request of Buyer set forth in this Section
5.9(b).

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3 of this Agreement, in connection with any indebtedness that Buyer intends not to repay or cause the

   Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to repay at the Closing, the Company
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in connection with maintaining such continuing indebtedness. In furtherance
of the foregoing, at the option of Buyer, Buyer shall approach any such
lender regarding maintaining the indebtedness and make all determinations and
decisions regarding such indebtedness and any payment of costs or fees
relating thereto and the Company shall provide Buyer with reasonable access
to any such lender and shall, if requested by Buyer, provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with such indebtedness in the same manner and with
the same conditions as provided in Section 5.9(b) above.

  

 (d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant to Section 5.9(b) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not cause a Triggering Event (as defined in the Companys articles of incorporation, as amended to the date hereof) to occur other than the occurrence of a Triggering Event upon the termination of the Apple Affiliate Agreements after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained and upon the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In the event that Buyer is obligated to pay the Buyer Termination Fee or any Company Expenses pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 7.2(d), Buyer shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Company from the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described below in this Section 7.2(d) or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside legal counsel as described below in this Section 7.2(d), an amount equal to the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure Buyers obligation to pay these amounts, Buyer shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Buyer Termination Fee and any Company Expenses with an escrow agent selected by the Company and on such terms (subject to this Section 7.2(d)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Buyer Termination Fee and any Company Expenses by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.2(d) shall be made at the time Buyer is obligated to pay the Company such amounts pursuant to this Section 7.2(d) by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a 

   letter from the Companys independent certified public accountant indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys
counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service holding that the receipt by the Company of the Buyer
Termination Fee and the Company Expenses would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or, alternatively, the Companys outside legal
counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the
Company of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses would
constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise
disqualify the Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall
release the remainder of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses
to the Company. Buyer and Acquisition Sub agree to amend this Section 7.2(d)
at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion
of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses that may be distributed
to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the
Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
Section 7.2(d) or (z) assist the Company obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside legal counsel as described in this Section 7.2(d). The
escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Buyer Termination
Fee and the Company Expenses held in escrow for five years shall be released
by the escrow agent to the Company. Any costs and expenses of the escrow
agent shall be borne solely by the Company. Buyer shall not be a party to the
escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have any liability
resulting from the escrow agreement.

  

 (e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, that the damages resulting from the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee and the Buyer Expenses or the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses, as applicable, are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.2 are a reasonable forecast of the actual damages which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. If a Party fails to pay a termination fee that it is required to pay under this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain payment, the Party to whom the fee is owed brings suit which results in a judgment against the defaulting Party, the defaulting Party shall pay the costs and expenses of the Party bringing suit (including attorneys fees), together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on all of the amounts owed at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., in effect from time to time during such period plus two percent (2%).

  

 Section 7.3. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Buyer as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any of its Affiliates or Representatives), except that (i) the provisions of Section 7.2 (other than Section 7.2(b)), this Section 7.3 and Article VIII and the indemnification and reimbursement provisions contained in the next to last sentence of Section 5.9(b), the Limited Guaranty and the 

   Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement,
and (ii) subject to Section 7.2(d) and Section 8.8, no termination shall
relieve any Party from any liability to another Party for any willful and
material breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  

 Section 7.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors or comparable governing bodies at any time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by Applicable Law would require further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such approval.

  

 Section 7.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Buyer may, subject to Applicable Law (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.4, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 Section 8.1. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

 Section 8.5. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 Section 8.6. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (except (i) to the extent the mandatory provisions of Virginia law are applicable and (ii) that Virginia law governs the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company) without giving effect to the principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

  

 (b) In any action or proceeding between any of the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, each of the Parties consents to exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and any courts from which appeals from judgments of that court are heard), or to the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in Delaware (and any courts from which appeals from judgments of that court are heard). Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objections it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions in any such Delaware state or federal court in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.6. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

   (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.6(C).

  

 Section 8.7. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the Companys shareholders, Buyer may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a party to the Merger in lieu of Acquisition Sub, in which event all references herein to Acquisition Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Acquisition Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_  that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of Contemplated Transactions. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 Section 8.8. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. 

  

 (a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The foregoing rights are in addition to and without any limitation of any other remedy to which Buyer and Acquisition Sub may be entitled at Law or in equity. The Company further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. The Company hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate, and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The Parties agree that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Acquisition Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Buyer 

   or Acquisition Sub or otherwise, shall be the remedy set forth in Sections
7.2(d); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to prevent any breach by Buyer or Acquisition Sub of the
last sentence of Section 5.2.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer and Acquisition Sub together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company relating to the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated, to a breach of this Agreement by Buyer or Acquisition Sub or otherwise shall be limited to the sum of the Buyer Termination Fee, the amount of any Company Expenses, the payment of any costs and expenses pursuant to Section 7.2(d) and the payment of any indemnification and reimbursement amounts pursuant to the next to last sentence of Section 5.9(b) (the "Liability Limitation"), and in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. The Company agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Buyer Parties (other than Buyer or Acquisition Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement), through Buyer, Acquisition Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempting piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer or Acquisition Sub against any Buyer Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any Applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Buyer Party) under and to the extent provided in the Limited Guaranty and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Buyer Party (other than Buyer or Acquisition Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Buyer or Acquisition Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Buyer Party (other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Limited Guaranty and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein). 

  

 (c) None of the officers, directors or shareholders of the Company shall be personally bound or have any personal liability hereunder. Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall look solely to the assets of the Company for satisfaction of any liability of the Company with respect to this Agreement. Buyer and Acquisition Sub will not seek recourse or commence any action against any of the shareholders of the Company or any of their personal assets, and will not commence any action for money judgments against any of the directors or officers of the Company or seek recourse against any of their personal assets, for the performance or payment of any obligation of the Company hereunder.

   Section 8.9. _Incorporation_. The Company Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits attached hereto and thereto and referred to herein and therein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  

 Section 8.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, (i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon, including Sections 7.2(c), 7.2(d) and 8.8, be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a partys liability or obligations hereunder or the Limited Guaranty.
