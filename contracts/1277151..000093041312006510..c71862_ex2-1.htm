Buyer shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Company from the Buyer
Termination Fee and the Company Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance

Termination Fee and the Company Expenses and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum
amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as

856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (&#147;<B>Qualifying Income</B>&#148;), as

outside legal counsel as described below in this Section 7.2(d), an amount

Termination Fee and any Company Expenses with an escrow agent selected by the

the Company&#146;s independent certified public accountant indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the
Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from the Company&#146;s accountants revising that
amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company&#146;s counsel indicating that the
Company received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service holding that the
receipt by the Company of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or,
alternatively, the Company&#146;s outside legal counsel has rendered a legal opinion
to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Buyer Termination Fee and
the Company Expenses would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or

agent shall release the remainder of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company
Expenses to the Company. Buyer and Acquisition Sub agree to amend this Section
7.2(d) at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the
portion of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses that may be
distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve
the Company&#146;s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
7.2(d) or (z) assist the Company obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside legal counsel as described in this Section 7.2(d). The escrow agreement
shall also provide that any portion of the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company
Expenses held in escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to
the Company. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne solely
by the Company. Buyer shall not be a party to the escrow agreement and shall

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are
an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, that the damages resulting
from the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee and the Buyer Expenses or
the Buyer Termination Fee and the Company Expenses, as applicable, are payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 7.2 are a reasonable forecast of the actual
damages which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and that without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement. If a Party fails to pay a termination fee that it is
required to pay under this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain payment, the
Party to whom the fee is owed brings suit which results in a judgment against
the defaulting Party, the defaulting Party shall pay the costs and expenses of
the Party bringing suit (including attorneys&#146; fees), together with interest
from the date of termination of this Agreement on all of the amounts owed at
the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., in effect from time to time during
such period plus two percent (2%).</FONT></P>

this Agreement.</FONT></P>

contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.4, waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its
