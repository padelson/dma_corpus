 **STOCK PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **THIS STOCK PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT** dated as of May 7, 2012, is made
by and among Energy Equity Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("
**Seller** "), the " **Individual Owners** " (as defined in _Article XII_ ),
solely for the purposes of _Section 7.14(a)_ , _Section 7.15_ , and _Article
X_ of this Agreement and, with respect to Michael A. Park only, _Section 7.13_
, and Clearfield Energy, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (" **Clearfield

Delaware corporation (" **Appalachian Oil** "), Kentucky Oil Gathering

OOGC Disposal Company I, an Ohio corporation (" **OOGC** "), MandB Gas Services,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **M andB**"), Clearfield Ohio Holdings, Inc., an
Ohio corporation (" **Clearfield Ohio** "), Pike Natural Gas Company, an Ohio
corporation (" **Pike** "), Eastern Natural Gas Company, an Ohio corporation
(" **Eastern** ") and Southeastern Natural Gas Company, an Ohio corporation ("
**Southeastern** ") (Clearfield Energy, Clearfield Holdings, WV Gathering,
Appalachian Oil, KY Gathering, OH Gathering II, OH Gathering III, OOGC, MandB,
Clearfield Ohio, Pike, Eastern and Southeastern sometimes being referred to in
this Agreement individually as a " **Company** " and collectively as the "
**Companies** "), and Crosstex Energy Services, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" **Buyer** ").

 



 

 ** _RECITALS:_**

 



 

Seller is the owner of all of issued and outstanding common stock of
Clearfield Energy (the " **Clearfield Stock** ").

 



 

Clearfield Energy is the direct or indirect owner of all of the issued and
outstanding common stock of each of the other Companies (collectively the "
**Subsidiary Stock** ").

 



 

Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller,
all of the Clearfield Stock on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

Each Company desires to join in the execution of this Agreement for the
purpose of evidencing its consent to the consummation of the foregoing
transaction and for the purpose of making certain covenants and agreements
with Buyer.

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT:_**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, Seller, the Companies and Buyer do hereby agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I _ 
TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION_**

 



 

 **Section 1.1** ** ****_Agreement to Purchase and Sell Clearfield Stock_**.
Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase, for the consideration
hereinafter set forth and subject to the terms and provisions herein, the
Clearfield Stock.

 



 

 **Section 1.2** ** ****_Purchase Price_**. In consideration of the sale of
the Clearfield Stock to Buyer, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Buyer will pay to Seller an aggregate cash purchase price of
$210,000,000 (the " **Purchase Price** "). The Purchase Price, as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.3_ , is the " **Adjusted Purchase Price**."

 



 

 **Section 1.3** ** ****_Potential Adjustments to the Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price will be:

 



 

(i) increased by the amount of any positive Working Capital;

 



 

(ii) decreased by the amount of any negative Working Capital;

 



 

(iii) increased by the amount of capital expenditures made by the Companies
between January 1, 2012 and the Closing Date and approved by Buyer;

 



 

(iv) increased by any amounts under _Section 7.18_ of this Agreement;

 



 

(v) decreased by any amounts under _Section 7.19_ of this Agreement; and

 



 

(vi) increased or decreased as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by
Seller and Buyer.

 



 

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
will prepare and submit to Buyer a statement setting forth, in reasonable
detail, Seller혪s good faith and reasonable computation of the estimated
adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided in _Section 1.3(a)_ , including
the estimated Working Capital of the Companies (" **Estimated Closing Working
Capital** "), derived from an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Companies as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " **Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet** "). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated
Closing Working Capital shall be prepared by Seller using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation and accrual
methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Company혪s Financial
Information (as defined in _Section 4.9_ ) as if such Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Working Capital were being prepared as of
a fiscal year end. Seller will furnish to Buyer, together with such
computation, copies of back-up and other supporting information and such other
documentation as Buyer may reasonably request that reasonably supports such
computation. Buyer will have three (3) Business Days after receipt of Seller혪s
statement to review such statement. If Buyer fails to give notice of objection
within the three (3) Business Day period, then Seller혪s statement will be used
for the

 



      
 

 



 

purpose of determining the Adjusted Purchase Price. If Buyer, in good faith,
objects to any portion of such statement, it will notify Seller in writing
(setting forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such objections and, to
the extent reasonably determinable by Buyer, Buyer혪s computation of the
adjustments to the Purchase Price) within three (3) Business Days of receipt
of Seller혪s statement, and Buyer and Seller will endeavor in good faith to
resolve any disputed matters prior to Closing. If Buyer and Seller resolve all
disputed matters prior to the Closing Date, the Adjusted Purchase Price at
Closing will be that mutually agreed amount. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
so resolve all disputed matters prior to Closing, the Adjusted Purchase Price
at Closing will be based on Seller혪s statement (including any amount still
being disputed by Buyer, but as adjusted to reflect all matters mutually
agreed upon). At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller will notify Buyer in writing of wiring instructions for payment.

 



 

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be
prepared and delivered to Seller a statement (the " **Final Settlement
Statement** ") setting forth the amount of the final adjustments to the
Purchase Price determined reasonably and in good faith in accordance with
_Section 1.3(a)_ (together with supporting documentation used by Buyer in
calculating each such amount and otherwise in preparing the Final Settlement
Statement and such other documentation as Seller may reasonably request). The
Final Settlement Statement shall be prepared by Buyer using the same
accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation and accrual
methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Company혪s Financial
Information as if such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing
Working Capital were being prepared as of a fiscal year end. Seller will
cooperate in good faith with Buyer in the preparation of the Final Settlement
Statement, and will promptly, but in any event within ten (10) days after
request, provide Buyer with, or access to, all documentation related to the
Final Settlement Statement reasonably requested by Buyer. Within thirty (30)
days after the Final Settlement Statement is delivered to Seller, Seller will
complete its examination thereof and may deliver to Buyer a written report
setting forth in reasonable detail any objections or, to the extent reasonably
determinable by Seller, proposed adjustments to the Final Settlement Statement
(the " **Objection Notice** "). Any objections or proposed adjustments that
are not included in a proper Objection Notice delivered to Buyer within thirty
(30) days after Seller혪s receipt of the Final Settlement Statement are
irrevocably waived and released by Seller. Seller and Buyer will each use
Reasonable Efforts to resolve any objections to the Final Settlement Statement
as described in the Objection Notice. If final resolution of such objections
is not obtained within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the
Objection Notice, Seller and Buyer will refer any unresolved objections to the
Referral Firm for its resolution. The resolution by the Referral Firm will be
binding on Seller and Buyer, and will be final and non-appealable. The scope
of the Referral Firm혪s engagement shall be limited to the resolution of the
items described in the Objection Notice and the corresponding calculation of
the adjustments pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_. In resolving any disputed item,
the Referral Firm (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 1.3_
and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for
such items claimed by either party. Seller will bear 50%, and Buyer will bear
50%, of the fees and expenses of the Referral Firm.

 



 

(d) Upon the resolution of the adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance
with _Section 1.3(c)_ (whether by agreement of Seller and Buyer (including
Seller혪s failure to timely

 



      
 

 



 

deliver an Objection Notice) or as determined by the Referral Firm), the
amount of the Purchase Price as so adjusted will be the " **Post-Closing
Adjusted Purchase Price**." If the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price
exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing, Buyer will pay Seller the
amount by which the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Adjusted
Purchase Price. If the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing, Seller will pay Buyer the amount by which
the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price.
If requested by Buyer, Buyer and Seller will issue written disbursement
instructions to the issuer of the Letter of Credit for the release of funds
from the Letter of Credit to Buyer in such amount.

 



 

(e) Within three (3) Business Days from the determination of the Post-Closing
Adjusted Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller will issue written instructions and
make payment of any amounts owed in accordance with _Section 1.3(d)_ ,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment
thereof at the "Prime Rate" as reported in the Wall Street Journal at the time
payment is due. Upon the resolution of the adjustments to the Purchase Price
in accordance with _Section 1.3(c)_ (whether by agreement of Seller and Buyer
(including Seller혪s failure to timely deliver the Objection Notice) or as
determined by the Referral Firm), there will be no further adjustments to the
Purchase Price (or Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price), except to the
extent, and for the purposes, provided in this Agreement.

Additionally, _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth (x) a
description of any contract covering services and compensation of any Person
engaged by a Company as an independent contractor or in such other non-
employee capacity and (y) a list of each employee of Seller or other Affiliate
of the Companies (other than Company Employees), if any, that provides
services to the Companies (each being an " **Affiliate Employee** ").

 



 

(b) _Section 4.16(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each
Employee Benefit Plan. None of the Companies has any binding obligation
arising from any communication to any Company Employee or to any other person
to materially modify any Employee Benefit Plan or to establish or implement
any other material benefit plan, program, or arrangement.

 



 

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated, and administered
in all material respects in accordance with such Employee Benefit Plan혪s
respective terms, and in material compliance with all Applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code. Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete
copies of the following: (i) the governing documents (such as written plans,

Employee Benefit Plans, and any related trust agreements, annuity contracts or
other funding instruments (other than any plan set forth in _Section 4.16(f)_
of the Disclosure Schedule); (ii) the latest IRS determination letter, if any,
obtained with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; (iii) all current summary plan

under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " **Qualified Plan** ") has received, from
the Internal Revenue Service, a favorable determination letter (or in the case
of a master or prototype plan, a favorable opinion letter or in the case of a
volume submitter plan, a favorable advisory letter) as to its qualification
under Section 401(a) of the Code, and Seller is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in revocation of any such letter. With respect to each such
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, except as set forth in _Section 4.16(c)_ of the Disclosure

"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

or a pension plan subject to the minimum funding standards of Section 302 and
Section 303 of ERISA or Section 412 and 430 of the Code, other than the Seller
Profit Sharing Plan and the Seller Pension Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA has, within the past six years, been
terminated and no proceedings have been instituted by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation to terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan. No material
liability has been incurred or is reasonably expected to be incurred under
Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.16(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that provides welfare benefits of the
type described in Section 3(1) of ERISA, no such plan provides medical or
death benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former
employees or partners of the Companies or their ERISA Affiliates beyond their
termination of employment, other than coverage mandated by Sections 601 - 608
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or similar applicable state law.

 



 

(g) To the Knowledge of Seller, no condition exists with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan that could result in the Companies becoming liable
directly or indirectly (by indemnification or otherwise) for any material
liability, except as has already been satisfied.

 



 

(h) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and administered in
compliance, and complies in form, with the requirements of, Section 409A of

solely responsible for any and all costs associated in any way with
implementation of the Phase II environmental investigation and will notify its
representatives they must look solely to Buyer to secure payment for any work
done or material furnished by those representatives in connection with the
Phase II investigation. Buyer and its representatives will conduct their
activities in such a way to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible,
interference with the activities and operations of Seller and the Companies.

 



 

(c) Seller is entitled to true, accurate and complete copies of any and all
reports, lab data and field notes prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in
connection with the Phase II investigation (with allowance to redact
privileged information), including the Phase II Report. If the Phase II

notification.

 



 

(d) All of Buyer혪s Phase II investigation activities will be conducted in
accordance with standard industry practice and with Applicable Law. Buyer will
be solely responsible for obtaining any necessary permits or approvals for

(e) Seller and Buyer will treat, and will require that its respective
representatives treat, as confidential all reports, data, studies, notes or

lenders and advisors in connection with Buyer혪s purchase of the Assets.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold each Company, Seller,
Affiliates of Seller, and their respective owners, officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, contractors, successors, and assigns
harmless from and against any and all Damages to the extent resulting from

including in connection with the Phase II investigation of the Assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.2 _Confidentiality Agreement_**. The Confidentiality Agreement,
except to the extent modified herein, will remain in full force and effect
until Closing, at which time it will automatically terminate without further
action by the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.3 _Reasonable Efforts_**. Each party to this Agreement agrees
that it will not voluntarily undertake any course of action inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement and will use its Reasonable Efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, (i) cooperation in determining whether any consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, waivers, declarations, filings, registrations or other
obligations of, with or to any Governmental Entity or third Person are
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) Reasonable Efforts to obtain any such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, and waivers and to effect any such obligations,
declarations, filings, and registrations; (iii) Reasonable Efforts to cause to
be lifted or rescinded any judgment, decree, injunction or restraining order
or other order restricting, preventing, prohibiting or otherwise adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) Reasonable Efforts to defend, and cooperation in
defending, all lawsuits or other legal Proceedings challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) the
execution of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Additionally, if, after the
Closing Date, either Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates, including any of the Companies) receives any payment or other
benefit from a third Person that is owed to the other party under this
Agreement, including but not limited to, any amounts included in the Retained
Accounts Receivable, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, will promptly pay that
amount or benefit over to the party to which it is owed.

 



 

 **Section 7.4 _Notice of Litigation_**. Until the Closing, (a) Buyer, upon
learning of the same, will promptly notify the Companies and Seller of any
Proceeding which is commenced or threatened against Buyer and which affects
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) Seller, upon
obtaining Knowledge of the same, will promptly notify Buyer of any Proceeding
which is commenced or threatened in writing against that Seller or any Company
and which affects the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
any Proceeding which is commenced or threatened against any Company which
would have been listed in _Section 4.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule if such
Proceeding had arisen prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Seller will give prompt notice to Buyer of: (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which is
reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty made by Seller in
_Article III_ or _Article IV_ to be untrue at or prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing of which Seller has Knowledge, (ii) any discovery that any
representation or warranty of Seller in _Articles III and IV_ is untrue, and
(iii) any failure of Seller or any Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Seller
or any Company hereunder prior to Closing. Buyer will give prompt notice to
Seller of: (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in _Article V_ to be untrue at or prior to the Closing, (ii) any
discovery that any representation or warranty of Buyer in _Article V_ is
untrue, and (iii) any failure of Buyer to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Buyer hereunder
prior to Closing. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates obtains Knowledge of a
breach by any of the Companies or Seller of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by any of the Companies or Seller contained in this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable Buyer will notify Seller and the
Companies of such breach.

 



 

(b) The delivery of any notice or of any supplements or amendments to the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section will not be deemed to: (i) modify
the representations or warranties hereunder of the party delivering such
notice, (ii) modify the conditions set forth in _Article X_ or (iii) limit or
otherwise affect the remedies (if any) available under this Agreement to the
party receiving such notice; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs and
the Disclosure Schedule has been supplemented or amended to reflect an
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event which arises after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing (each, a " **Post-Signing Event** ") which
did not arise out of a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant or
Seller or the Companies set forth in this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement, for the purposes of determination of Seller혪s indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Article X_, the amendment or supplement of the
Disclosure Schedule regarding such Post-Signing Event will be deemed to be
included in the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of determining whether or not
any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller and the Companies
has occurred.

 



 

 **Section 7.6 _Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) The Company Employees set forth on _Section 7.6(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be terminated by the applicable Company prior to the Closing
and shall not be deemed as "Continuing Employees" for purposes of this
_Section 7.6_.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a written list of those Affiliate Employees, if any, who
Buyer would like to continue as employees (the " **Business Employees** ") of
Buyer, the Companies or their Affiliates after the Closing. Within at least
five Business Days following Buyer혪s delivery of the list described in the
preceding sentence, Seller shall provide, in writing, to Buyer the information
described in clauses (i) through (v) of _Section 4.16(a)_ with respect to
each Business Employee (and without regard to the fact that each such Business
Employee is not, as of such time, a Company Employee). Buyer, in its sole
discretion, shall make offers of employment to any or all of the Business
Employees within at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing, and each
such Business Employee shall have five Business Days from receipt of an offer
from Buyer to accept the offer. Seller, the Companies and their Affiliates,
shall not induce or otherwise attempt to influence any such Business Employee
to resign or to not accept his or her offer of employment from Buyer. Prior to
the Closing Date, (i) the employment of all Business Employees who have
accepted Buyer혪s offer of employment shall be transferred to the Companies, it
being understood

 



      
 

 



 

that such Business Employees will thereafter become Company Employees (and
Continuing Employees) for purposes of this _Section 7.6_ and (ii) Buyer and
Seller will cooperate in good faith to identify the Company to which each such
Business Employee shall be transferred pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 



 

(c) Seller will be responsible for discharging all obligations under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. 짠 2101, et seq.)
(" **WARN Act** ") and similar applicable local laws for the notification of
Company Employees of any "employment loss" within the meaning of the WARN Act
and similar applicable local law which occurs on or prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer acknowledges that it has not informed Seller of any planned or
contemplated decisions or actions by Buyer that would require the service of
notice under the WARN Act. Buyer agrees that it will not take, or omit to
take, any action that causes the notice provisions of the WARN Act to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to create any
liability or penalty to Seller or any of its Affiliates for any employment
terminations under Applicable Law (including, without limitation, under the
WARN Act or any Applicable Law prohibiting discrimination in employment);
provided that Seller will provide Buyer at Closing with a list of employees
who have been terminated or notified of their termination during the ninety-
day period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, Seller shall take all such action as necessary to ensure the (i)
removal of all current and former union employees of the Companies (the "
**Removed Employees** ") as participants in the Profit Sharing Plan for
Employees of Clearfield Energy, Inc., Ohio Oil Gathering Corporation, II and
Eastern Shore Gas Company (the " **Seller Profit Sharing Plan** "), and (ii)
creation of a separate Qualified Plan (the " **Spin-Off Profit Sharing Plan**
") and trust that will be substantially identical to the Seller Profit Sharing
Plan and trust, such that, immediately prior to the Closing Date, the only
participants in the Spin-Off Profit Sharing Plan shall include (as of such
time) the Removed Employees, and in no event shall any Removed Employees
remain as participants in the Seller Profit Sharing Plan as of such time.
Buyer and Seller will cooperate in good faith to effect a transfer of assets
from the Seller Profit Sharing Plan혪s trust to the Spin-Off Profit Sharing
Plan혪s trust in compliance with Applicable Law. Upon the transfer of assets
described in the preceding sentence, the obligations for all benefits owed by
the Seller Profit Sharing Plan attributable to each of the Removed Employees
as participants in that plan will be assumed by the Spin-Off Profit Sharing
Plan and, as applicable, the Companies as participating employers therein. Any
resolutions, plan amendments and/or restatements, notices or other
documentation (" **Official Plan Materials** ") required to effect the
conditions of this _Section 7.6(d)_ shall be made in a manner reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, it being understood that, within a reasonable time prior
to finalizing such Official Plan Materials, and in any event, no later than
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
drafts of any such Official Plan Materials for Buyer혪s review and comment.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, Seller shall take all such action as necessary to ensure that,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Seller Profit Sharing Plan
shall be terminated, (ii) the sponsor and plan administrator of the Seller
Profit Sharing Plan are transferred or otherwise changed to Seller for any
post-Closing termination activities, (iii) none of the Companies shall be
participating employers in the Seller Profit Sharing Plan, and (iv)
distribution of benefits for the remaining

 



      
 

 



 

participants in the Seller Profit Sharing Plan shall be paid in accordance
with such plan혪s terms. Buyer shall permit the current employees of the
Companies, other than the Removed Employees, that are employed by Buyer on and
after the Closing Date to roll over their account balances and outstanding
loan balances, if any, under the Seller Profit Sharing Plan into any "eligible
retirement plan" maintained by Buyer within the meaning of Section
402(c)(8)(B) of the Code, subject to any restrictions on loan balance
transfers under Buyer혪s applicable "eligible retirement plan." Any Official
Plan Materials required to effect the conditions of this _Section 7.6(e)_
shall be made in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer, it being understood
that, within a reasonable time prior to finalizing such Official Plan
Materials, and in any event, no later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer drafts of any such Official Plan
Materials for Buyer혪s review and comment.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, Seller shall take all such action as necessary to ensure that the
sponsor and plan administrator of the Pension Plan of Ohio Oil Gathering
Corporation II and Retirement Plan of Pike Natural Gas Company (" **Seller
Pension Plan** ") is transferred or otherwise changed to Seller, such that,
upon the Closing, none of the Companies shall be participating employers in
such Seller Pension Plan. Promptly after the execution date of this Agreement,
Seller shall begin to take the steps necessary to terminate the Seller Pension
Plan, including distribution of all required notices and the making of all
filings required by Applicable Law. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
terminate the Seller Pension Plan as promptly as possible following the
Closing.

 



 

(g) Within fifteen Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall provide notice to all current employees of the Companies of the
termination of the post-retirement health and other post-retirement welfare
benefits described in _Section 4.16(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule ("
**Seller Retiree Welfare Arrangements** "). Prior to the Closing Date, and
notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Seller shall transfer
the Seller Retiree Welfare Arrangements to a plan to be adopted by Seller, and
shall retain all responsibility and liability under the Seller Retiree Welfare
Arrangements for all eligible former employees and their dependents who are
eligible as of the Closing Date to receive such benefits thereunder (each, a "
**SRWA Participant** "), subject to the terms and conditions of such Seller
Retiree Welfare Arrangements as they may from time to time be amended. Other
than Excluded Liabilities or any other covenants or agreements of Seller
expressly provided in this Agreement, Seller shall not have any responsibility
and liability for post-retirement health and other post-retirement benefits
for any Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) As of the Closing and subject to applicable state insurance laws, Title I,
Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, (i) Buyer may
continue to maintain, or cause the Companies to continue to maintain any
Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by any of the Companies immediately prior to
the Closing (" **Continued Plans** ") for the benefit of Company Employees who
are employed by the Companies, Buyer or an Affiliate thereof, as applicable,
after the Closing (the " **Continuing Employees** "), as well as the
dependents of such employees (collectively, with the Continuing Employees, the
" **Affected Participants** "), and (ii) with respect to any such Continued
Plan, the Affected Participants shall be entitled to participate in such
Continued Plan pursuant to its terms and conditions from and after the Closing
until such time that Buyer or an Affiliate thereof, as applicable, suspends
participation in or terminates such Continued Plan or the accrual of benefits
thereunder (the " **Transition Period** "). Prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Seller
shall take all such action as necessary to ensure that, immediately prior to
the Closing Date, the only participants in the Continued Plans shall be the
Affected Participants and only the Companies shall be participating employers
in the Continued Plans. Seller or its Affiliates shall have no responsibility
therefor and thereafter, for any claims of the Affected Participants under the
Continued Plans provided, however, that the Seller or its Affiliates shall
remain liable for any claims incurred prior to the Closing Date under the
Continued Plans for any individual who is not an Affected Participant. Buyer
shall have no responsibility for any claims incurred either prior to or on and
after the Closing Date under the Continued Plans for any individual other than
an Affected Participant. For the purposes of this _Section 7.6(h)_, a claim
will be deemed incurred, in the case of hospital, medical or dental benefits,
when the services that are the subject of the charge are performed and, in the
case of other benefits (such as disability or life insurance), when an event
has occurred that entitles the employee to the benefit. Prior to the Closing
Date, and notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Seller and
Buyer shall take all such action as necessary to ensure that (i) the
Clearfield Energy, Inc. Group Health Plan and (ii) any other Employee Benefit
Plans sponsored by any of the Companies as of the date hereof and designated
by Seller and Buyer as a "TSA Plan" (clauses (i) and (ii) hereof being, the "
**TSA Plans** ") shall be transferred to Seller as an Excluded Asset and
maintained by Seller for the benefit of Affected Participants for a limited
time following the Closing as agreed by Seller and Buyer (the " **Applicable**
**TSA Period** "). The Transition Services Agreement shall provide, with
respect to any TSA Plans, that Seller shall, at the request and expense of
Buyer, acquire stop loss coverage for any such TSA Plan effective as of the
Closing. Any Official Plan Materials required to effect the conditions of this
_Section 7.6(h)_ shall be made in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer, it
being understood that, within a reasonable time prior to finalizing such
Official Plan Materials, and in any event, no later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer drafts of any such
Official Plan Materials for Buyer혪s review and comment.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing or the Transition Period, as applicable, Buyer may
elect to have the Affected Participants commence participation in the
applicable employee benefit plans, programs or policies, if any, maintained by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each, a " **Buyer Plan** ") on terms to be
determined by Buyer and its Affiliates subject to the eligibility requirements
of each such Buyer Plan and the provisions of this Agreement, subject to
applicable state insurance laws, Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code. Any such participation in the Buyer Plans that are
group health, life and disability plans as well as other employee welfare and
fringe benefit plans and programs shall be on the same basis as Buyer혪s new
hires, except that Buyer will recognize service with Buyer, the Companies,
Seller or their Affiliates to determine benefit eligibility. Buyer Plans will
credit Affected Participants for all applicable payments made for health care
expenses under Seller혪s health care plans during the applicable plan year,
policy year or calendar year for purposes of deductibles and maximum out-of-
pocket limits in which the Affected Participants commence participation
therein; provided that such Affected Participants shall provide Buyer with
reasonable back-up data with respect to such co-payments, deductibles and
offsets upon Buyer혪s request. Seller shall be solely responsible for offering
and providing any COBRA continuation coverage required under Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar state law ("
**COBRA** "), with respect to any Company Employee or Affiliate Employee who
experiences a qualifying event prior to the Closing, and for any Company
Employee or Affiliate Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee who
experiences a qualifying event on or after the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for offering
and providing any COBRA continuation coverage required with respect to any
Continuing Employee who experiences a qualifying event on or after the
Closing. "Qualifying event" and "continuation coverage" are as defined in
Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. It is
also understood that, except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer reserves the
right to change, modify, discontinue or terminate any or all of its own
welfare benefit plans (including the Continued Plans) at the discretion of
Buyer at any time following the Closing Date.

 



 

(j) Subject to Applicable Law, (i) the Companies (or Seller, as applicable)
shall determine the monetary value of any vacation time that is accrued and
unused by each Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) the unpaid portion of the annual bonus, if any, that was earned by each
such Continuing Employee as set forth in _Section 7.6(j)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule for the annual bonus measurement period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, " **Accrued Entitlements** ") and shall pay such
Accrued Entitlements (less any withholding tax) in cash or a cash equivalent
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior the Closing. Buyer shall
provide Continuing Employees with paid vacation benefits on the same basis as
Buyer혪s new hires, except that Buyer will recognize service with Buyer, the
Companies, Seller or their Affiliates to determine benefit levels under its
applicable policies and practices. For the avoidance of doubt, for Continuing
Employees represented by a union, Buyer will provide vacation benefits,
including vacation pay, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
collective bargaining agreement.

 



 

(k) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, to the extent that any
Affected Participant becomes eligible to participate in any Buyer Plan, then
for all purposes (including determining eligibility to participate and
vesting), service recognized by the Companies, Seller and its Affiliates shall
be treated as service under such Buyer Plan; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized for benefit accrual purposes under any Buyer
Plan which is a qualified defined benefit pension plan, or to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. To the extent
that Buyer maintains or establishes a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
on or after the Closing Date for the benefit of Continuing Employees (the "
**Buyer Defined Contribution Plan** "), which shall be at Buyer혪s sole
discretion, Buyer will recognize prior service with the Companies, Seller and
its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and vesting purposes under the
Buyer Defined Contribution Plan. In addition, to the extent permissible under
the terms of a Buyer Plan, and absent any change in such Buyer Plan혪s coverage
Buyer shall waive any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions,
proof-of-good-health requirements, evidence of insurability and waiting
periods with respect to participation by and coverage in connection with the
participation and coverage requirements in connection with the medical, dental
and vision benefits that the Affected Participants may be eligible to receive
pursuant to such Buyer Plan after the Closing or the Transition Period, as
applicable.

 



 

(l) The parties to this Agreement agree to furnish each other with such
information concerning employees and employee benefit plans, and to take all
such other action, as is necessary and appropriate to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 7.6_, subject to any applicable restrictions
under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as
amended, and other federal and state privacy laws. Where any required
information is in the possession of third parties controlled by Seller, such
as insurers or trustees, Seller shall use

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to cause those third parties to cooperate in providing any
such information to Buyer. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller or its Affiliate will transfer each Continuing Employee혪s employment
records to Buyer.

 



 

(m) Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period beginning as of the
Closing and ending on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
**Continuation Period** "), (i) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to each Continuing Employee a base salary or hourly wage that is not
less than such Company Employee혪s base salary or hourly wage, as applicable,
in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, subject to _Section 7.6(i)_, participate in
commission, incentive and bonus compensation plans and programs through the
Continuation Period that are substantially similar to the commission,
incentive and bonus plans and programs for similarly situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates. The provision of compensation to the Company
Employees pursuant to this _Section 7.6(m)_ may be transitional in nature and
in no event shall this _Section 7.6(m)_ be construed as guaranteeing
employment for any specific period of time.

 



 

(n) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 7.6_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in
any other person, including, without limitation, any employees, former
employees, any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan or any
beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the Companies, Buyer
or any of their Affiliates, or particular benefits or coverage in any Employee
Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan. The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ shall not
constitute an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan.

 



 

 **Section 7.7 _Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer will be responsible and, as applicable, cause the Companies to pay,
and Buyer agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Seller, for any and all (i)
Taxes of the Companies for all Post-Closing Straddle Periods, (ii) tax periods
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (iii) one-half of any Transfer
Taxes. Seller shall be responsible, and agree to hold harmless and indemnify
Buyer and the Companies, for (i) Taxes of the Companies for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, (ii) all Taxes of the Companies for all Pre-Closing Straddle
Periods and (iii) one-half of any Transfer Taxes (other than any Taxes taken
into account in determining the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section 1.3_). Buyer and Seller agree not to take any position with
respect to Taxes inconsistent with the intended tax treatment of this
transaction and the provisions of this Section 7.7(a).

 



 

(b) Seller will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Companies that are required to be filed after
the Effective Time with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (the " **Pre-
Closing Returns** "). Seller will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes imposed on
the Companies shown as due and owing on such Pre-Closing Returns and any
amendments to such Tax Returns, except to the extent any such Taxes are taken
into account in determining the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section 1.3_. Seller will prepare or cause to be prepared the respective
Pre-Closing Returns consistently with the most recent customs and practices of
the Company, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Within a reasonable period of time prior to filing a Pre-Closing Return,
Seller will furnish a copy of such Pre-Closing Return to Buyer.

 



 

(c) Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Return covering a
Straddle Period that is required to be filed after the Effective Time with
respect to any of the Companies (the " **Straddle Period Returns** ")
consistently with the most recent customs and practices of the Company (or its
Affiliate, as applicable), unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Within
a reasonable period of time prior to the due date (including extensions) of
any Straddle Period Return, Buyer will furnish a copy of such Straddle Period
Return to Seller, together with a request for Seller혪s payment to Buyer of the
amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period (other than
Taxes taken into account in determining the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 1.3_) and reasonable supporting documentation. If
Seller has no objections to the content of the Straddle Period Return, Seller
will pay Buyer the amount requested. Buyer will thereafter pay such amount to
the Governmental Entity to which the Taxes are owed and provide reasonable
documentation to Seller confirming such payments within ten (10) days of the
dates of such payments. Seller will notify Buyer in writing of the existence
of any comments or objections (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and
basis of such comments or objections) of Seller to any items set forth on the
draft Straddle Period Return for the Company (a " **Tax Dispute Notice** ").
Buyer and Seller will consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If
Buyer and Seller, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve the
dispute within thirty (30) days after the Tax Dispute Notice was delivered to
Buyer, then Seller and Buyer will submit such dispute to the Referral Firm.
The resolution of the Referral Firm will be binding on Seller and Buyer, and
will be final and non-appealable. Seller will bear 50%, and Buyer will bear
50%, of the fees and expenses of the Referral Firm. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the terms and provisions of this _Section 7.7(c)_ will not
prohibit Buyer from timely filing the Straddle Period Returns, but Buyer will
file, or cause to be filed, an amended Straddle Period Return to the extent
necessary to reflect the applicable parties혪 agreed resolution of the
objections contained in the Tax Dispute Notice or the determination of the
Referral Firm after the original filing due date.

 



 

(d) For purposes of allocating Taxes of the Company between that portion of
the Straddle Period ending prior to the Effective Time (the " **Pre-Closing
Straddle Period** ") and that portion of the Straddle Period beginning at the
Effective Time (the " **Post-Closing Straddle Period** "), the portion of such
Taxes related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be deemed to be: (i) in
the case of Taxes (other than income Taxes, franchise and margin Taxes, Taxes
measured in whole or in part by reference to gross revenues or receipts,
income, excise, employment, withholding, gross receipts and other similar
Taxes and sales and use Taxes), equal to the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, provided that Seller will not be required to pay any Taxes to the
extent such Taxes were taken into account in determining the Adjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 1.3_; and (ii) in the case of income Taxes,
franchise and margin Taxes, Taxes measured in whole or in part by reference to
gross revenues or receipts, income, excise, employment, gross receipts and
other similar Taxes and sales and use Taxes, will be allocated between the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period as though the
taxable year of the Company terminated based on interim closing of the books
as of the Effective Time, and based on accounting methods, elections and

 



      
 

 



 

conventions that do not have the effect of distorting income and expenses. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations will be
made in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company with respect
to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Buyer will notify Seller promptly after receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or
similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period for which Seller may be liable under this Agreement (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " **Tax Matter** ").
Seller, at its own expense, will have the exclusive authority to represent the
interests of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or with respect to any
Tax Matter before the IRS or any other Governmental Entity involving the
Company and will have the sole right to control the defense, compromise or
other resolution of such Tax Matters, including responding to inquiries,
filing Tax Returns and settling audits; _provided, however_ , that Seller will
not settle, compromise or concede any such Tax Matter without first obtaining
Buyer혪s consent if such settlement, compromise or concession could materially
increase Taxes or taxable income or reduce tax deductions for Buyer, the
Company or their Affiliates in any Post-Closing Tax Period (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer will execute or
cause to be executed powers of attorney or other documents necessary to enable
Seller to take all actions desired by Seller with respect to such Tax Matters,
but only with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Seller may in its sole
discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, Proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any Governmental Entity with respect to such Tax
Matter for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and subject to _Section 7.7(g)_, may
initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return, or take any other
action which is deemed appropriate by Seller with respect to such Tax Matter,
but only with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Seller will keep Buyer fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
Tax Matter over which Seller has such exclusive authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller and Buyer will jointly control all proceedings in connection
with any Tax Matter relating solely to Taxes for a Straddle Period, and will
bear and pay costs and expenses related to such proceedings in proportion to
their respective shares of Taxes claimed in respect of such Tax Matter. No
party will settle a Tax Matter relating solely to Taxes of the Companies for a
Straddle Period without the other party혪s prior written consent (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and which consent
will be considered to be unreasonably withheld if such settlement has no
adverse effect on the other party).

 



 

(f) Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Companies), on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will cooperate with each other in
contesting any Tax Matter, which cooperation will include, without limitation,
the retention and, at the contesting party혪s request and expense, the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Matter, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Matter.

 



 

(g) Except as may be required by Applicable Law, Seller will not file or cause
or permit to be filed any amended Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods
for any Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without
receiving prior written consent from Buyer, which may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Except as may be required by

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Law, Buyer will not file or cause to be filed any amended Tax
Returns or make any Tax election covering any period or adjusting any Taxes
for a period with respect to a Company which includes (i) any Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which may be withheld in
Seller혪s sole discretion, or (ii) a Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Seller, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer
will not make any election under Code Section 338 (or any similar provision
under state, local or foreign law) with respect to the acquisition of any
Company; provided that, if any such action is required by Applicable Law,
Buyer will notify Seller prior to taking such action.

 



 

(h) Any refund or credit of Taxes paid or payable that is attributable to the
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Pre-Closing Straddle Period
will be for the account of Seller. Any refunds or credits of Taxes paid or
payable that are attributable to the Companies for any other taxable period
will be for the account of Buyer. Buyer, if Seller so requests and at Seller혪s
expense, will cause the Companies to file for and obtain any refunds or
credits attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to which Seller or the
Companies are entitled under Applicable Law. Buyer will cause the Companies to
forward to Seller any such refund (along with any interest received thereon)
within ten (10) days after the refund is received (or reimburse Seller for any
such credit within ten (10) days after the credit is applied against another
Tax liability); provided, however, that Seller will indemnify Buyer for any
amount paid pursuant to this _Section 7.7(h)_ if any such refund or credit is
subsequently disallowed.

 



 

(i) Buyer혪s allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price to the restrictive
covenants set forth in _Section 7.15_ will be subject to Seller혪s approval
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(j) Seller and Buyer agree to furnish to each other at Closing or as soon
thereafter as practicable any and all information and documents reasonably
required to comply with Tax and financial reporting requirements and audits.

 



 

 **Section 7.8 _Fees and Expenses_**. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement by Seller and the Companies will be borne by
and paid by Seller, regardless of whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement by Buyer will be borne by and paid by Buyer, regardless of whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

 



 

 **Section 7.9 _Public Announcements_**. If Buyer or Seller desires to issue
any press release or make any statement to the public generally with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the party desiring
to issue a release or make a statement will obtain the prior consent of the
other party (except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.9_). If Buyer or
Seller requests consent to issue a press release or make a public statement,
the party receiving the request will not unreasonably withhold or delay the
consent, if the consent is given verbally, the consenting party will confirm
it in writing within one (1) Business Day after verbally consenting.
Regardless of the foregoing, however, any party to this Agreement may make any
public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Applicable Law, the
rules of any exchange upon which its securities are publicly traded, or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case, if Buyer is the disclosing party, it will advise Seller, and if
Seller or a Company is the disclosing party, Seller will advise Buyer, in each

 



       
 

 

instance before making the disclosure and will provide the other, to the
extent practicable, with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed
disclosures).

 



 

 **Section 7.10** ** ****_Books and Records_**. At or as soon as reasonably
practicable after Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer all records of the
Companies, including original minute books and other corporate books and
records and accounts, policies of insurance, real property, equipment,
materials and service contracts, Permits, and all regulatory, environmental,
tariff, financial, audit, and tax data, records, reports, returns, filings,
notices, correspondence, memoranda, and other information (in physical or
digital form), including all documents supporting such reports, returns,
filings, correspondence and memoranda. Buyer will preserve all records so
delivered by Seller for a period of six (6) years following the Closing and
will allow Seller reasonable access to such records at all reasonable times
for a purpose reasonably related to (i) Seller혪s ownership of the Companies or
the Assets or (ii) the performance by it of its obligations, and the
enforcement by it of its rights, hereunder. If Buyer desires to dispose of any
such records prior to the expiration of the six (6)-year period referenced
above, Buyer will provide notice of same to Seller, and Seller will have a
period of ten (10) days to deliver written notice to Buyer that Seller elect
to have such records delivered to them (at the expense of Seller). If Seller
fails to deliver such notice within the ten (10)-day period referenced above,
Buyer may dispose of the subject records.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** ** ****_Excluded Assets_**. After the date hereof and at
least one (1) Business Day prior to Closing, (a) Clearfield Holdings will
convey, transfer and assign all of the stock in the Excluded Companies to
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other than a Company, and (b) any Company
owning any right, title or interest in the assets and properties described in
_Section 7.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " **Excluded Assets** ") will
convey, transfer and assign that right, title or interest in the Excluded
Assets to Seller or a party designated in writing by Seller (other than a
Company). Each such conveyance, transfer and assignment will be (i) for no
consideration whatsoever, save and except for the assumption by the assignee
of all liabilities attributable or relating directly or indirectly to the
Excluded Assets or the Excluded Companies, whether arising before, on or after
the date of assignment, and (ii) on an "as is, where is" basis without any
representations and warranties by Clearfield Energy or any other Company
including any warranty of title, fitness for purpose, or merchantability.

 



 

 **Section 7.12** ** ****_HSR Filing_**. Within ten (10) days following
execution of this Agreement, Seller (or its ultimate parent entity, as
applicable) and Buyer will file with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice, as applicable, the notification and report forms
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " **HSR Act** "), and will seek "early termination" of the
statutory waiting period. The Parties will comply with their respective
obligations under _Section 7.3_ in connection with the preparation of that
filing and responding to any inquiries or requests in connection therewith.
Buyer and Seller will, as promptly as practicable, furnish any supplemental
information which may be requested in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller
will use Reasonable Efforts to: (a) make or modify all other filings and
submissions on a prompt and timely basis in connection with the filings
required under the HSR Act, and (b) promptly resolve any objection asserted by
any Governmental Entity to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer will each bear all of their own costs and expenses relating
to its compliance with this Section; provided, however, that all filing fees
required with respect to the filings pursuant to the HSR Act shall be paid by
Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer and Seller will furnish to the other such necessary information and
assistance as reasonably requested by the other party in connection with any
necessary filings and submissions pursuant to the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller
shall notify and keep the other party informed as to any material
communication from the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of
Justice or any other applicable Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall (a) participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with
the other party in advance, and if permitted, allows the other party the
opportunity to participate, or (b) consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other.

 



 

 **Section 7.13** ** ****_Termination of Certain Affiliate and Other
Arrangements_**. Except for obligations specified in this Agreement and the
agreements and arrangements listed in _Section 7.13_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, all of which will continue after the Closing in accordance with
their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, all agreements and
arrangements between and among the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller and
their Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand, and all
liabilities and obligations of the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller and
their Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand, will
automatically terminate in their entirety effective as of the Closing without
any further actions by the parties and thereby be deemed voided, cancelled and
discharged in their entirety. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except with respect to the agreements and arrangements listed in
_Section 7.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule effective upon the Closing, all
intercompany accounts among the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller and
their Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand, that then
remain outstanding will be terminated, voided, cancelled and discharged.
Additionally, Clearfield Energy and Michael A. Park hereby agree to terminate
that certain Executive Employment Agreement, dated May 1, 2011, between
Clearfield Energy and Michael A. Park on or prior to the Closing Date, upon
which termination all liabilities and obligations of Clearfield Energy to Mr.
Park under that Executive Employment Agreement will automatically terminate
and be deemed entirely voided, cancelled and discharged.

 



 

 **Section 7.14** ** ****_Release_**.

 



 

(a) Effective on and as of the Closing, Seller, for itself and its Affiliates
(excluding the Companies, but including each current and past officer,
director and shareholder of each Company, Seller and its Affiliates) and its
and their respective successors and assigns, and each Individual Owner, hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably releases, waives and forever discharges Buyer
and each Company and their respective Affiliates and their respective agents,

claims, demands, losses, actions and causes of action, suits, judgments and
controversies of any kind whatsoever (whether known or unknown, contingent or
fixed, accrued or unaccrued) in connection with or otherwise related to the
Companies or their respective businesses (other than claims by Seller for
indemnification which Seller is entitled to make pursuant to _Article X_ or
for any liabilities or obligations of Buyer under this Agreement or for any
agreements or arrangements that this Agreement expressly provides will
continue after Closing) (collectively, the " **Seller Released Claims** ")
that Seller, its Affiliates (excluding the

 



      
 

 



 

Companies, but including each current and past officer, director and
shareholder of each Company, Seller and its Affiliates) or its and their
respective successors or assigns, has or claims to have now or arising in the
future out of events or circumstances accruing on or before the Closing Date
against any or all of Seller Released Parties. Seller further agrees not to
file or bring any claim, suit, action, complaint or arbitration with respect
to Seller Released Claims and Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller Released Parties from Seller Released Claims brought by
Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Companies, but including each current
and past officer, director and shareholder of each Company, Seller and its
Affiliates) or its and their respective successors or assigns.

 



 

(b) Effective on and as of the Closing, Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) and its and their respective successor and assigns,
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably releases, waives and forever discharges
Seller and its respective Affiliates and their respective agents, employees,
representatives, officers, directors, managers, past and present, and the

**Buyer Released Parties** "), from any and all debts, liabilities, claims,
demands, losses, actions and causes of action, suits, judgments and
controversies of any kind whatsoever (whether known or unknown, contingent or
fixed, accrued or unaccrued) in connection with or otherwise related to the
Companies or their respective businesses (other than claims by Buyer for
indemnification which Buyer is entitled to make pursuant to _Article X_ or
for any liabilities or obligations of Seller or the Individual Owners under
this Agreement or for any agreements or arrangements that this Agreement
expressly provides will continue after Closing) (collectively, the " **Buyer
Released Claims** ") that Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Companies) or
its and their respective successor or assigns has or claims to have now or
arising in the future out of events or circumstances accruing on or before the
Closing Date against any or all of Buyer Released Parties. Buyer further
agrees not to file or bring any claim, suit, action, complaint or arbitration
with respect to any Buyer Released Claim and Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Buyer Released Parties from any Buyer Released Claims
brought by Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Companies) or its and their
respective successor or assigns.

 



 

 **Section 7.15** ** ****_Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation;
Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and each
Individual Owner will not, and Seller will cause each of its Affiliates
(collectively, the " **Restricted Persons** ") not to, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, engaged in crude oil, condensate, natural gas
liquids and natural gas gathering, transportation, distribution or marketing,
or water treatment or brine disposal (a " **Restricted Business** ") within
the States of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia (the "
**Restricted Area** "); provided, however, that no such Restricted Person will
be deemed to be so competing by reason of: (i) ownership, management,
operation, control or participation in the ownership, management, operation or
control of the Excluded Companies to the extent the business of the Excluded
Companies is the business conducted by the companies as of the date of this
Agreement, or (ii) the acquisition, directly or indirectly (including by
purchase, exchange, joint venture, merger or otherwise) of a Restricted
Business so long as the amount of the consideration in that acquisition that
is allocated to assets within the Restricted Area is no more than 10% of the
aggregate consideration in the overall transaction, or (iii) owning securities
in

 



      
 

 



 

companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange,
or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic
Quotation System (NASDAQ) or any other securities exchange in the United
States or any other country, provided that the direct and beneficial ownership
of any class of securities in any of such entities by any such Restricted
Person is not more than 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares,
units or interests of such class of securities.

 



 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates nor any Individual Owner will solicit, raid,
encourage, entice or induce, directly or indirectly, any Company Employee
employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, to (i) terminate his or her
employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) refrain from extending or
renewing the same (upon the same or new terms), (iii) refrain from rendering
services to or for Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (iv) become employed by or
to enter into contractual relations with any persons other than Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, or (v) enter into an employment or contractual relationship
with a competitor of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided that the
foregoing shall not prohibit solicitations through advertisements and other
customary employment marketing practices which are not targeted to any Company
Employees.

 



 

(c) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and each
Individual Owner will not, and Seller will cause each other Restricted Person
and their respective officers, directors, consultants, employees and advisors
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate
to any Person, any Confidential Information (as defined below) other than: (x)
to authorized officers, directors, consultants, employees and advisors of
Seller and Seller혪s Affiliates that have a reasonable need to know and that
agree to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information in
accordance with this Agreement and (y) as reasonably required, to exercise any
rights or obligations or in connection with any dispute under this Agreement
or (ii) use or otherwise exploit any Confidential Information for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Buyer. The Restricted Persons
will not have any obligation to keep confidential any Confidential Information
if and to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by Law;
provided, however, that in the event disclosure is required by applicable Law,
Seller shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide Buyer with prompt
notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Buyer may
seek an appropriate protective order. For purposes of this _Section 7.15(c)_,
" **Confidential Information** " shall mean any confidential information that
applies solely to any Company or any of the Assets, including, to the extent
applicable, customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, trade
secrets, plans, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized
information or proprietary matters. Confidential Information does not include,
and there shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that
(i) is generally available to the public on the Closing Date or (ii) becomes
generally available to the public or Seller or a Restricted Party other than
as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section relate to matters
which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a violation of
any of the terms of this Section will cause irreparable injury to the parties,
the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which
cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, without the necessity of proving
actual damages, Buyer will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this

 



      
 

 



 

Section. The rights and remedies provided by this Section are cumulative and
in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may have hereunder or
at law or in equity. If Buyer were to seek damages for any breach of this
Section, the portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price which is allocated by the
parties hereto to the foregoing covenant, if any, shall not be considered a
measure of or limit on such damages.

 



 

(e) The parties to this Agreement agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified
time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or
any other relevant feature of this Section is unreasonable, arbitrary or
against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be reasonable, not
arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable
party.

 



 

 **Section 7.16** ** ****_Acquisition Proposal_**. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, Seller and the Companies will not, and Seller and the Companies
will cause their Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives, consultants, advisors or agents (collectively, the
" **Company Parties** ") not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),
(b) engage in discussions or in negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal
with any person or entity, or (c) disclose any nonpublic information relating
to any of the Companies or the Assets to any person or entity that is
considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal. If any of the Company
Parties receives any Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement,
Seller must immediately communicate to Buyer that an Acquisition Proposal has
been received. The term " **Acquisition Proposal** " means any offer or
proposal for, or any indication of interest (other than from Buyer) in, a
merger, sale, consolidation or other business combination involving any of the
Companies, or any of the Assets, or the acquisition of any equity interest in
any of the Companies. Notwithstanding the above, the restrictions in this
Section do not apply to any of the Excluded Companies or the Excluded Assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.17** ** ****_Confidentiality of Others_**. Effective immediately
prior to Closing, Seller or the Companies, as applicable, shall assign to one
or more of the Companies, all rights under any transferable confidentiality
and/or non-disclosure agreements entered into in connection with any attempt
by Seller to market or sell the Assets or the Companies. From and after
Closing, upon Buyer혪s written request and at Buyer혪s sole cost, Seller will
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to enforce any non-transferable agreements
with other Persons with respect to the confidentiality and non-disclosure of
confidential information of the Companies.

 



 

 **Section 7.18** ** ****_Inactive Easements_**. If, at any time within the
ten (10)-year period following the Closing Date, Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates, including the Companies) sells or uses for the ownership, use,
operation or maintenance of any of its assets or properties any of the rights-
of-way, easements, leases and servitudes identified on _Section 7.18_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (each, an " **Inactive Easement** "), then Buyer will pay
Seller for that Inactive Easement so used or sold an amount equal to ten
dollars ($10.00) per linear foot used or sold included in that Inactive
Easement within ten (10) days of such use or sale. Within fifteen (15) days of
each of the ten anniversaries of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller
with a report listing each Inactive Easement sold or used in the prior annual
period and the total linear feet used or sold

 



      
 

 



 

included in each such Inactive Easement. Buyer shall provide Seller with
reasonable access to the books and records of Buyer and its Affiliates with
respect to the Inactive Easements to the extent reasonably requested by Seller
in order to audit the reporting of and payment for the use or sale of such
Inactive Easements as required herein, provided, however, Seller shall not be
permitted to perform more than one (1) audit in any quarterly period. Within
thirty (30) days following the expiration of that ten (10)-year period, Buyer
will pay to Seller (a) $10,000,000 less (b)(i) any amounts paid by Buyer to
Seller for Inactive Easements under this _Section 7.18_ and (ii) any amounts
owed to Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee for any unsatisfied liability or
obligation of Seller or any Individual Owner under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.19** ** ****_Title Review of LDC Properties and Title
Defects_**.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Title Defect** " means: (i)
any matter identified on _Section 4.18(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and
designated as a "Title Defect" and (ii) any breach by Seller of _Section
4.18(b)_, _Section 4.18(c)_, _Section 4.18(d)_, or _Section 4.18(e)_ with
respect to the LDC Properties identified by Buyer prior to the expiration of
the LDC Properties Title Review Period in accordance with its review of the
LDC Properties following execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practical after the execution of this Agreement, but
in no event later than 5:00 p.m. (CST) on June 1, 2012 (the " **LDC Properties
Title Review Period** "), Buyer will notify Seller of any matter that is a
Title Defect with respect to the LDC Properties (an " **LDC Properties**
**Title Defect Notice** "). Seller will notify Buyer within five (5) days
following Seller혪s receipt of an LDC Properties Title Defect Notice of whether
Seller will: (i) attempt to cure the Title Defect identified in that notice;
or (ii) accept a downward adjustment in the Purchase Price equal to an amount
mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer for that Title Defect, which, in the
case of Easements, will be an amount equal to ten dollars ($10.00) per linear
foot included in that Easement.

 



 

(c) Except for any Title Defect for which Seller elects to accept a downward
adjustment in the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 7.19(b)_, Seller
will use its commercially reasonable efforts, at Seller혪s sole cost and
expense, to cure all Title Defects (whether a Title Defect as defined under
clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 7.19(a))_ on or prior to Closing in a manner
that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer. If, despite Seller혪s commercially
reasonable efforts, Seller is unable to cure a Title Defect prior to Closing
and the Purchase Price is adjusted for that Title Defect at Closing, Seller
will have no further liability or obligation to Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnitee under this Agreement with respect to that Title Defect. If, despite
Seller혪s commercially reasonable efforts, Seller is unable to cure a Title
Defect prior to Closing and the Purchase Price is not adjusted for that Title
Defect at Closing, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts, at
Seller혪s sole cost and expense, to cure the Title Defect within 90 days
following the Closing Date. If Seller has not cured the Title Defect within
that 90-day period, the Adjusted Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount
mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer for that Title Defect (which, in the
case of Easements, will be an amount equal to ten dollars ($10.00) per linear
foot included in that Easement) and Seller will have no further liability or
obligation to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee under this Agreement with
respect to that Title Defect.

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; or

 



 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if:

 



 

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before September 30, 2012, unless such
failure to close is due to a breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i); or

 



 

(ii) there is any statute, rule, or regulation that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited or
a Governmental Entity has issued a final and non-appealable Order restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) by Seller, if (i) Buyer has failed to fulfill any of its material
obligations under this Agreement; or (ii) any of the representations and
warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement are not true and correct in
all material respects and, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) such

Adverse Effect so long as Seller or the Companies are using Reasonable Efforts
to cure.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 9.2** ** ****_Effect of Termination_**. If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 by Seller, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other, written notice of the termination will promptly be given
to the other party or parties specifying the provision of this Agreement

void and have no effect, except that the agreements contained in this _Article
IX_, in _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.8_, and in _Articles

hand, or Buyer, on the other, may: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the

as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power, or privilege.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X _ 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS; 
INDEMNIFICATION; LETTER OF CREDIT_**

 



 

 **Section 10.1** ** ****_Survival_**.

 



 

(a) Each covenant and agreement of the parties to this Agreement that is
contained in this Agreement will survive the Effective Time and the Closing
Date for the period of the statute of limitation (plus any extensions or
waivers thereof) applicable to that covenant or agreement, other than this
_Article X_, which will survive indefinitely. The representations and
warranties of the parties to this Agreement that are contained in this
Agreement will survive the Effective Time and the Closing Date as follows: (i)
the Specified Representations and Warranties of Seller and the representations
and warranties of Buyer in _Article V_ will survive Closing indefinitely; and
(ii) all other representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement (except for Seller혪s representations and warranties in _Section
4.12_ (Taxes)) will survive for a period of eighteen (18) months after the
Effective Time, and (iii) the representation and warranties of Seller in
_Section 4.12_ (Taxes) will survive Closing and shall expire thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the end of
the survival period specified in each of _Sections 10.1(a)(i)_ , _(a)(ii)_
and _(a)(iii)_ being an " **Expiration Date** "); provided that any
representation or warranty as to which a claim is asserted in compliance with
this _Article X_ prior to the applicable Expiration Date shall survive until
such claim and the indemnity with respect thereto are resolved.

 



 

(b) No party to this Agreement will have any indemnification obligation
pursuant to this _Article X_ or otherwise in respect of any representation,
warranty or covenant that survives Closing unless it has received from the
party seeking indemnification written notice of the existence of the claim for
or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such representation,

 



      
 

 



 

warranty or covenant is being sought on or before the applicable Expiration
Date. Such notice will set forth with reasonable specificity to the extent
reasonably known at that time (i) the basis under this Agreement, and the
facts that otherwise form the basis of such claim, (ii) the estimate of the
amount of such claim (which estimate will not be conclusive of the final
amount of such claim) and an explanation of the calculation of such estimate,
including a statement of any significant assumptions employed therein, and
(iii) the date on and manner in which the party delivering such notice became
aware of the existence of such claim.

 



 

 **Section 10.2** ** ****_Indemnification by Seller_** ** _and the Individual
Owners_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_, from and
after Closing, Seller and each Individual Owner, jointly and severally, will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including the
Companies), and their respective directors, managers, partners, officers,
agents, employees, successors and assigns (" **Buyer Indemnitees** ") from and
against any and all Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or
incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee, directly or indirectly, by reason of or
resulting from (a) any breach by Seller of any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the certificate delivered by Seller
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_ and for which notice is received by Seller in
accordance with _Section 10.1_ before the Expiration Date applicable to the
representation or warranty that Buyer alleges has been breached (and following
the determination of whether any such representations or warranties have been
breached, and solely for purposes of determining the Damages attributable to
such breach, each such representation and warranty and any qualification with
respect thereto contained in the Disclosure Schedule will be read without
regard or giving effect to any "material," "Material Adverse Effect,"
"materiality" or "substantial" qualifications, or words of similar meaning,
that may be contained therein), (b) any breach by Seller of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement other than the covenants contained in
_Section 7.4_ or _Section 7.5_ or (c) any Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

Neither Seller nor any Individual Owner will have any right of contribution
against any Company with respect to any breach by any Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** ** ****_Indemnification by Buyer_**. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this _Article X_, from and after the Closing, Buyer will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, managers, partners, officers, agents, employees,
successors and assigns (" **Seller Indemnitees** ") from and against any and
all Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by any
of them, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from (a) any breach
by Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement or the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ and (b) except to the extent Seller is required to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees in accordance with _Section 10.2_, whether incurred or
resulting from events or circumstances that occur before, on or after the
Closing Date, the ownership and operation of the Companies and their
respective properties and other assets, or any and all Damages in any way
relating to the Companies.

 



 

 **Section 10.4** ** ****_Indemnification Proceedings_**. If any claim or
demand for which a party (an " **Indemnifying Party** ") would be liable to
another party to this Agreement under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ ("
**Indemnified Party** ") is asserted against or sought to be collected from an

 



       
 

 



 

Indemnified Party by a third party, the Indemnified Party will with reasonable
promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, but the
failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this _Article X_, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have thirty (30)
days from receipt of the above notice from the Indemnified Party (in this
_Section 10.4_, the " **Notice Period** ") to notify the Indemnified Party
whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Party혪s
sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or
demand; provided, that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and
during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or demand,
the Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel at its
own expense and to participate in the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to assume the defense of such claim or demand (or fails to
give notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period), the
Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume the defense of such claim or
demand with counsel of its own choice, at the expense, and upon the approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), of the Indemnifying
Party. If the claim or demand is asserted against both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and based on the advice of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party there are one or more defenses available
to the Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party or
there is a conflict of interest which renders it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for paying separate counsel for the
Indemnified Party of its own choice, upon the approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party will not be responsible for paying for
more than one separate firm of attorneys to represent all of the Indemnified
Parties, regardless of the number of Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of such claim or demand, (i) no compromise
or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the
Indemnified Party혪s written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld)
unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party will have no liability
with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its
written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld). This _Section
10.4_ shall not apply to Tax Matters, which shall be governed by _Section
7.7(e)_.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** ** ****_Exclusivity_**. Seller, each Individual Owner, each
Company and Buyer agree that after Closing, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, including in _Section 7.15_ and _Section 11.10_
of this Agreement, the sole and exclusive relief and remedy available to any
party to this Agreement in relation to any breach, default, or nonperformance
of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made or entered into
by a party to this Agreement or under any certificate, instrument, or document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement: (a) will be Damages, and (b) any claim
for those Damages can only be brought under, and in accordance with, the terms
and provisions of this _Article X_, provided, that there shall be no such
limitations on remedies with respect to claims involving fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct. Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee
is entitled to payment from the Letter of Credit of any payment required to be
made by Seller under this _Article X_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 10.6** ** ****_Limitation of Liability_**.

 



 

(a) This _Section 10.6(a)_ does not apply to a breach of the Specified
Representations and Warranties or to claims under _Section 10.2(b)_ or
_Section 10.2(c)_. Except for Damages arising from a breach of the Specified
Representations and Warranties, Seller is not liable, and will not be required
to indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees, on account of any Damages
under _Section 10.2(a)_, until the aggregate Damages arising from all
breaches exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the total Post-Closing
Adjusted Purchase Price (the " **Deductible** "). If Damages under _Section
10.2(a)_ (other than the Specified Representations and Warranties for which
Seller will be, subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 10.6(b)_,
liable to the full extent of all Damages under _Section 10.2(a)_) exceed the
Deductible, then, subject to the limitations in _Section 10.6(b)_, Seller
will be liable to the full extent of all Damages under _Section 10.2(a)_ in
excess of the Deductible (other than the Specified Representations and
Warranties for which Seller will be, subject to the conditions set forth in
_Section 10.6(b)_, liable to the full extent of all Damages under _Section
10.2(a)_).

 



 

(b) This _Section 10.6(b)_ does not apply to claims for indemnification
relating to Excluded Liabilities under _Section 10.2(c)_, which are not
subject to any Deductible or Cap Limitation (as defined below). Subject to all
of the terms and conditions of this _Article X_, neither Seller nor any
Individual Owner is liable to the Buyer Indemnitees, and the Buyer Indemnitees
are not entitled to indemnification from Seller or any Individual Owner and
the Buyer Indemnitees waive and release Seller and its Affiliates and each
Individual Owner from any such liability for: (a) all indemnifiable Damages
under _Section 10.2(a)_ (except for Damages arising from a breach of any of
the Specified Representations and Warranties), in excess of $21,000,000, and
(b) Damages arising from a breach of any of the Specified Representations and
Warranties or arising under _Section 10.2(b)_ in excess of the total Post-
Closing Adjusted Purchase Price (the maximum limit in (a) or (b) as applicable
being a " **Cap Limitation** "). Seller is not liable for any Damages under
_Sections 10.2(a)_ or _(b)_ in excess of the applicable Cap Limitation.

 



 

(c) The Buyer Indemnitees혪 right to make a claim for indemnification for any
Damages shall be reduced by (i) any tax benefits to the Buyer Indemnitee or
any other Affiliate of Buyer associated with such Damages, (ii) any insurance
proceeds available to cover such Damages, whether or not the Buyer Indemnitee
elects to make and process a claim under the applicable insurance policy or
policies, and (iii) any proceeds recovered from a third party. Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Damages.

 



 

(d) In no event shall Seller be liable for any amount that is specifically
reflected as a liability of a Company on the Final Settlement Statement or the
balance sheet underlying such statement.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** ** ****_Limited to Actual Damages_**. The obligations of
the parties under this Agreement, including the indemnification obligations of
the parties provided in _Section 7.1(f)_ and _Article X_, will be limited to
actual Damages and will not include incidental, consequential, indirect,
punitive, special or exemplary Damages or Damages for lost profits (except for
lost profits that constitute direct damages with respect to a breach of
_Section 4.13_ (Contracts)), provided that any incidental, consequential,
indirect, punitive, special or exemplary Damages recovered by a third Person
(including a Governmental Entity, but excluding any Affiliate of any

 



      
 

 



 

party) against a party entitled to indemnity pursuant to _Article X_ will be
included in the Damages recoverable from the indemnitor under such indemnity.

 



 

 **Section 10.8** ** ****_Reliance_**. Notwithstanding any right of Buyer to
fully investigate the affairs of Seller and the Companies and notwithstanding
any knowledge of facts determined or determinable by Buyer pursuant to such
investigation or right of investigation, Buyer has the right to rely fully
upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller, the
Companies and the Individual Owners contained in this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.9** ** ****_Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_**. All
indemnity payments made under this Agreement, including any payment made under
_Section 7.7(a)_, will be treated as Purchase Price adjustments for Tax
purposes.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** ** ****_Letter of Credit_**.

 



 

(a) At Closing, Seller will provide Buyer the Letter of Credit for the Letter
of Credit Amount to secure payment of amounts owed under _Section 1.3(c_) and
Section 1.3(d) and Seller혪s indemnity obligations under _Article X_. Buyer
may draw against the Letter of Credit Amount only, as applicable, by: (i)
agreement of Seller and Buyer, (ii) upon the final, non-appealable order of a
Governmental Entity, or (iii) with respect to payment due Buyer pursuant to
Section 1.3(d), upon a determination by the Referral Firm in accordance with
Section 1.3(c) and if requested by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(d). Seller
and Buyer will execute and deliver written instructions to the issuer of the
Letter of Credit or as otherwise required to implement the terms of this
Section, including disbursement instructions for amounts owed to Buyer, if
any, upon resolution of the Post-Closing Adjusted Purchase Price (if requested
by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(d) _)_ or any claim by Buyer for
indemnification. Seller will pay all fees and charges relating to the Letter
of Credit.

 



 

(b) The Letter of Credit Amount will be utilized solely to satisfy payment of
amounts owed by Seller to Buyer under _Section 1.3(d)_, if any (and if
requested by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(d) _)_ , and any indemnification
obligations of Seller and the Individual Owners under this Agreement, but the
existence of the Letter of Credit or the Letter of Credit Amount in no way
limits the parties혪 payment obligations under _Section 1.3(d)_ or Seller혪s or
any Individual Owner혪s indemnification obligations under this Agreement. The
Letter of Credit shall, subject to clause (d) below, have a term of twelve
(12) months commencing on the Closing Date (as may be extended in accordance
with this Section, the " **LC Term** ").

 



 

(c) If Buyer (or any other Buyer Indemnitee) asserts a claim for
indemnification against Seller or any Individual Owner under _Article X_ of
this Agreement prior to the expiration of the LC Term and Seller does not
dispute such claim, that Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
by Seller and the Individual Owners in accordance with _Article X_, and the
Buyer Indemnitee shall have the right to draw from the Letter of Credit, and
the parties will issue any required disbursement instructions for the
distribution to the Buyer Indemnitee of, funds in an amount equal to the
amount of Damages for which the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled for such claim
under _Article X_. If the amount to which the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled
exceeds the Letter of Credit Amount by more than the amount equal to (i)
$10,000,000 minus (ii) any amounts paid

 



      
 

 



 

to Seller pursuant to _Section 7.18_ hereof, Seller and the Individual Owners
are responsible for prompt payment to the Buyer Indemnitee of that excess
amount. If, however, Seller disputes a claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for
indemnification, that Buyer Indemnitee shall receive from the Letter of Credit
(and the parties will issue any required disbursement instructions for the
distribution to the Buyer Indemnitee of) any undisputed amount, but shall not
be entitled to receive any such disputed portion thereof from the Letter of
Credit with respect to such claim prior to resolution of such dispute in
accordance with this Agreement and, if such dispute extends beyond the
expiration of the LC Term, Seller shall issue a replacement letter of credit
for the disputed amount, and if Seller does not issue such replacement letter
of credit, the parties shall issue disbursement instructions for the
distribution of the disputed amount into a joint interest bearing account at
PNC Bank, National Association to be held until resolution of the dispute.

 



 

(d) Any payment required to be made to any Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this
_Article X_ for indemnification claims made by any Buyer Indemnitee under
_Section 10.2_ shall be paid first by release of all or a portion, as
applicable, of the Letter of Credit Amount pursuant to the terms of the Letter
of Credit and second by offset against amounts due Seller pursuant to _Section
7.18_ (including offset against amounts due Seller from Buyer under _Section
7.18_ for used or sold Inactive Easements). Any payments required to be made
to any Buyer Indemnitees following the date that is eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date pursuant to this _Article X_ for indemnification
claims made by any Buyer Indemnitee under _Section 10.2(a)_ shall be
satisfied first by offset against any amounts that due to Seller pursuant to
_Section 7.18_ on and after the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date (including offset against amounts due Seller from Buyer under
_Section 7.18_ for used or sold Inactive Easements).

should refuse to perform under the provisions of this Agreement, monetary

addition to any other remedies which may be available, including money
damages, and without the necessity of proving actual damages have resulted or
would result in the absence thereof, to obtain specific performance of the
terms of this Agreement. In the event of any action to enforce this Agreement
