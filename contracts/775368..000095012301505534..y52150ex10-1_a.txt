                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE MERGER

                  Section 2.1 The Merger.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, MergerSub shall be merged (the
"Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"),
and the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease. Following the
Effective Time, the Company shall be the surviving corporation (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation").

                  (b) Not later than the second Business Day after satisfaction
or, to the extent permitted hereby, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to those conditions), the Company and MergerSub will
file articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Department of
Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin and make all other filings or
recordings required by the WBCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such date and time (but not later than the close of business
of the date of Closing) which the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and
designated in the Articles of Merger filed with the Department of Financial
Institutions of the State of Wisconsin in accordance with the WBCL as the
effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").

                  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of MergerSub and the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of MergerSub and
the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue its corporate
existence under the WBCL.

                  (d) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall be held at
the offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY
(or such other place as agreed by the parties) at 10:00 a.m. New York City time
on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby,
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to those
conditions), unless the parties hereto agree to another date or time.

                  Section 2.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The articles of incorporation of MergerSub, as in effect
immediately prior


                                      -8-
<PAGE>   13
to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. The bylaws of MergerSub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

                  Section 2.3 Board of Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time (until successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified), (i) the directors of MergerSub at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation. Immediately following the Effective Time,
the headquarters of the Surviving Corporation shall be located in Madison,
Wisconsin.


                                  ARTICLE III
                  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES AND RELATED MATTERS

                  Section 3.1 Conversion of Capital Stock.

                  (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each
Merger Share shall be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to
receive $16.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

                  (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Common Share held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration
therefor and cease to exist.

                  (c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of
MergerSub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  Section 3.2 Payment.

                  (a) Paying Agent. Promptly after the date hereof, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
as a paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the benefit of holders of Company
Common Shares. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide to the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this Section 3.2,
through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount equal to (1) (x) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of Merger Shares (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions in accordance with this Article III, deliver to the
holders of Company Common Shares and Company Options the cash contemplated to be
issued pursuant to this Article III out of the Fund. Except as contemplated by
this Section 3.2, the Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Such funds
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however,
that such


                                      -9-
<PAGE>   14
investments shall only be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of the Company Common Shares. If for any reason (including losses) the
Fund is inadequate to pay the cash amounts to which holders of shares of Company
Common Shares and Company Options shall be entitled, Parent shall in any event
remain liable to pay such amounts to such holders, and shall make available to
the Paying Agent additional funds for the payment thereof. The Fund shall not be
used for any purpose, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

                  (b) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (each, a "Certificate")
that formerly represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, a letter
of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form reasonably
approved by the Company prior to the Effective Time and specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) for use in the exchange for payment
contemplated by this Section 3.2. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying
Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III (after giving effect to any required withholding
Tax). In no event will holders of Company Common Shares be entitled to interest
on the Merger Consideration. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If any portion of
the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the proper amount of the Merger
Consideration, as contemplated by this Article III.

                  (c) No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Shares.
As of the Effective Time, all Company Common Shares shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Company Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate, the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the Company's stock transfer books of Company


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   15
Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for payment as provided in this
Section 3.2.

                  (d) Return of Merger Consideration. Upon demand by Parent, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent any portion of the Fund deposited with the
Paying Agent that remains undistributed to holders of Company Common Shares six
months after the Effective Time. Holders of Certificates who have not complied
with this Section 3.2 prior to such demand shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration.

                  (e) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Company Common Shares for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

                  (f) Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration payable hereunder to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign income Tax
Law. To the extent that Parent so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.

                  Section 3.3 Company Stock Options.

                  (a) Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.3(b) below, at
the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Shares
(each, a "Company Option") shall entitle the holder to receive in settlement and
cancellation thereof a lump sum cash payment equal to (x) the product of (i) the
total number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Company Common Share subject to such Company Option, less
(y) the amount of any Federal, state and local and foreign income and employment
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the Company and/or any Subsidiary
from, or with respect to, the exercise of the Company Option.

                  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company's
stock option plan and other compensation plans or any Employee Program) that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.3(a).
Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all outstanding Company Options, including the holder, number of Company
Common Shares subject to each such Company Option and exercise price per Company
Common Share. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts (i) to enter into with each holder of an outstanding
Company Option an amendment of the terms of the agreement pursuant to which such
Company Option was granted, which amendment shall be in a form satisfactory to
Parent and shall provide for the disposition of the Company Option as
contemplated by Section 3.3(a), and (ii) to obtain the consent of each holder of


                                      -11-

an outstanding Company Option to such amendment. It shall be a condition to the
payment to any holder of a Company Option of the amounts contemplated by Section
3.3(a) that such holder consent to the amendment of the terms of the agreement
pursuant to which such Company Option was granted as contemplated by this
Section 3.3(b).

each case as listed on Exhibit C hereto, and (v) all other consents, approvals,
actions, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings except

likely, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair or interfere with
the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to conduct
their businesses substantially in the manner as such businesses are now being
conducted or otherwise have a Company Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the
"Company Government Approvals"); provided, however, that no representation is
made with respect to any of the foregoing that Parent, MergerSub or the Company
may be required to obtain because of its specific legal or regulatory status or
any other facts that specifically relate to Parent or MergerSub or any business
in which they engage.

                  Section 4.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and

notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default) under or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right
or obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss of any
benefit or status to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled

that would not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  Section 4.5 Capitalization.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of

imposing liability for unpaid wages). Neither the


                                      -13-

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for unpaid wages except

                  (b) Except (i) as set forth in this Section 4.5 and (ii) for
changes since May 31, 2001 resulting from the exercise of stock options, there
are no outstanding (x) shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company, (y) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, or (z) options,
warrants or other rights of any kind (including, without limitation, preemptive
rights or subscription rights) to acquire from the Company, and there is no
obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting
securities of the Company (the items in clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred
to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Company Securities.

                  Section 4.6 Subsidiaries.

                  (a) Section 4.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly incorporated or an entity duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing, under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the requisite corporate power
and authority required to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, in each case
with such exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.6(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) true and complete copies of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable organizational
documents) of each of the Subsidiaries of the Company as currently in effect and
(ii) a true and correct list of the current officers and directors of each of
the Subsidiaries of the Company.

                  (b) The Company conducts its insurance operations through the
Subsidiaries listed in Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Company Insurance Subsidiaries"). Each of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance
company in its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized,
or otherwise eligible to act, as an insurance company in each other jurisdiction
where it is required to be so licensed, authorized or eligible, and (iii) duly
licensed, authorized or eligible in its jurisdiction of incorporation and each
other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as being
written in the Company Statutory Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined).
Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of the insurance licenses, authorizations and other approvals of the
Company and each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries (including the
jurisdictions in which the Company and each of such Company Insurance
Subsidiaries possess such insurance licenses, authorizations or other
approvals), together with true and correct copies of such licenses. To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of the Company


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   19
Insurance Subsidiaries is improperly transacting any insurance or reinsurance
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not authorized or permitted to
transact such business. All of the licenses and authorizations set forth on
Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are valid and in full force
and effect. None of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has at any time after
January 1, 1991 had its license or qualification to conduct insurance business
in any jurisdiction revoked or suspended and, to the knowledge of the Company,
(i) none of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has at any time prior to January
1, 1991 had its license or qualification to conduct insurance business in any
jurisdiction revoked or suspended and (ii) no proceeding is pending in any
jurisdiction with a review to revocation or suspension of such license or
qualification. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 1991, none of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries has been involved in a proceeding in any such
jurisdiction with a view to revocation or suspension of any such license. The
Company has made all required filings under applicable insurance holding company
statutes except where the failure to file, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None
of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries is commercially domiciled for insurance
regulatory purposes in any jurisdiction.

                  (c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (subject to
the provisions of Wis. Stats. Sec. 180.0622(2)(b), Wis. Stats. Sec. 611.33(1)(d)
or any other statutes imposing liability for unpaid wages), and are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, free and
clear of any Lien and free of any other limitation or restriction (including any
limitation or restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock or other ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests in any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) options,
warrants or other rights of any kind (including, without limitation, preemptive
rights or subscription rights) to acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests in, any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding securities of any of its
Subsidiaries or any capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, any of
its Subsidiaries. Except for the Investment Securities (as hereinafter defined),
the Company does not directly or indirectly own any interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity other than
the Subsidiaries.

                  Section 4.7 The Company SEC Documents.

                  (a) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
copies of the Company SEC Documents listed on Exhibit B hereto. The Company has
filed all reports, filings, registration statements and other documents required
to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 1998. No Subsidiary of the
Company is required to file any form, report, registration statement or
prospectus or other document with the SEC.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>   20
                  (b) As of their respective filing dates or, if amended, as of
the date of the last such amendment filed prior to the date hereof, each Company
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be.

                  (c) (i) No Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange
Act contained, as of its filing date or mailing date, as applicable, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) no Company SEC Document
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as amended or supplemented, if applicable,
contained, as of the date such document or amendment became effective, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

                  Section 4.8 Financial Statements; Reserves.

                  (a) The audited consolidated financial statements included in
the Company 10-Ks (the "Company Audited Financial Statements") were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently
applied throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto regarding the adoption of new accounting policies). The Company Audited
Financial Statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, and present fairly
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods then
ended. The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the
Company 10-Q (the "Company Interim Financial Statements", and together with the
Company Audited Financial Statements, the "Company GAAP Financial Statements")
were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
periods involved and in a manner consistent with that employed in the Company
Audited Financial Statements. The Company Interim Financial Statements contain
limited footnote disclosures and are subject to normal recurring year-end
adjustments, but otherwise present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated
therein except as otherwise set forth therein.

                  (b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true
and complete copies of the NAIC Annual Convention Statement for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the Quarterly Convention Statement for the
quarterly period ended March 31, 2001 of each of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries as filed with the applicable insurance regulatory authorities,
including all exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and any actuarial
opinions, affirmations or certifications or other supporting documents filed in
connection therewith (collectively, the "Company Statutory Financial
Statements"). Except as expressly set forth in the notes, exhibits or schedules
thereto, the Company Statutory Financial Statements fairly present in all
material respects, in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed
or


                                      -16-
<PAGE>   21
permitted by the applicable insurance regulatory authority applied on a
consistent basis, the statutory financial position of such Company Insurance
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the statutory results of
operations of such Subsidiaries for the respective periods then ended. The
Company Statutory Financial Statements complied in all material respects with
all applicable Laws when filed, and no deficiency has been asserted with respect
to any Company Statutory Financial Statements by the applicable insurance
regulatory body or any other governmental agency or body. The annual statutory
balance sheets and income statements included in the Company Statutory Financial
Statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, and the Company has delivered
to Parent true and complete copies of all audit opinions related thereto.

                  (c) The Company's methodology for providing insurance loss
reserves on the Company GAAP Financial Statements and on the Company Statutory
Financial Statements is accurately described in the Actuarial Report.

                  (d) (i) The reserves carried on the Company Statutory
Financial Statements of each Company Insurance Subsidiary for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the three-month period ended March 31, 2001 for unearned
premiums, losses, loss adjustment expenses, claims and similar purposes
(including claims litigation) are in compliance with the requirements for
reserves established by the insurance departments of the jurisdiction of
domicile of such Company Insurance Subsidiary, were determined in accordance
with commonly accepted actuarial standards of practice and principles
consistently applied, were based on actuarial assumptions that were in
accordance with or stronger than those called for in relevant policy and
Contract provisions, and are fairly stated in accordance with commonly accepted
actuarial and statutory accounting principles; (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, as of the dates of submission of the Company Statutory Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2001, the reserves reflected thereon were in the aggregate
adequate to cover the total amount of all liabilities of the Company and each
Company Insurance Subsidiary under all outstanding insurance, reinsurance and
other applicable agreements as of the respective dates of such Company Statutory
Financial Statements, and as of such dates the admitted assets of the Company
and each Company Insurance Subsidiary as determined under applicable Laws are in
an amount at least equal to the minimum amounts required by applicable Laws; and
(iii) there are no agreements to which any Company Insurance Subsidiary is a
party concerning the maintenance of any reserves by any of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries that go beyond normal legal requirements of Law.

                  (e) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all actuarial reports, actuarial certificates and loss
and loss adjustment expense reserve reports prepared and signed by Alan J.
Hapke, FCSA, MAA, doing business as Aspect, Inc., and any other report prepared
by any third-party actuarial consultant on behalf of or made available to the
Company or any of its Affiliates, in each case relating to the adequacy of the
reserves of any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries for any period ended on or
after December 31, 1996 (the "Actuarial Analyses"). To the knowledge of the
Company the information and data furnished by the Company or any of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries to its independent actuaries in


                                      -17-

complete in all material respects as of their respective dates of delivery.

                  Section 4.9 Agents and Producers; Fronting.

                  (a) Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth each Contract with any agent, broker, intermediary, manager or producer
("Broker") to place or sell any insurance or reinsurance policies on behalf of
any Company Insurance Subsidiary since January 1, 1999. Except as set forth on
Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no single Broker generated
more than 5% of the aggregate gross written premium of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries during each of the years ended December 31, 1999 or December 31,
2000. To the knowledge of the Company, each Broker with more than 1% of the
aggregate gross written premium of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries during the
year ended December 31, 2000 is duly licensed (to the extent that such licenses
are required) in each jurisdiction in which the Broker places or sells insurance
or reinsurance on behalf of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries, and to the
knowledge of the Company, each such Broker is duly authorized and appointed by
the applicable Company Insurance Subsidiary pursuant to applicable insurance and
reinsurance Laws in all material respects. To the knowledge of the Company, all
Contracts between any Broker, on the one hand, and any Company Insurance
Subsidiary, on the other hand, are in compliance with all applicable insurance
and reinsurance Laws. Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the Company's procedures for handling disciplinary actions or proceedings
involving Brokers. To the knowledge of the Company, no Broker or Brokers who
individually accounted for more than 1% of the aggregate gross written premiums
of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2000, or
in the aggregate accounted for more than 10% of the aggregate gross premium
during the year ended December 31, 2000, have given or been given written notice
of termination or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or been
threatened with termination, or threatened or been threatened with a substantial
reduction in the amount of premiums to be written by such Person on behalf of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries. There is no dispute material to the Company
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Broker.

                  (b) Section 4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of the pools and fronting agreements,
Contracts or other instruments providing for insurance services (excluding
Insurance Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) to which
any Company Insurance Subsidiary has been a party since January 1, 1996, all of
which either (i) have been terminated prior to the date hereof or (ii) may be
terminated at the option of the Surviving Corporation on or after the date of
the Effective Time without the payment of any penalty.

                  (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
managing general agency Contracts or other similar arrangements under which an
independent party has authority to perform underwriting analysis and issue
insurance or reinsurance policies on behalf of any of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries or otherwise bind any of


                                      -18-
<PAGE>   23
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries without prior approval of the individual
insurance or reinsurance policy by the applicable Company Insurance Subsidiary.

                  Section 4.10 No Material Undisclosed Liabilities. (i) There
are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the
Company of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise ("Liabilities") that would be required by
GAAP to be and were not reflected on or reserved against in the Company Balance
Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto, and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company had any such
Liabilities whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against
in the Company Balance Sheet, other than in the case of clauses (i) and (ii),
(w) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the Company Balance
Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto; (x) liabilities or obligations incurred
or arising after December 31, 2000 and disclosed in the Company 10-Q or provided
for in the Company balance sheet (or notes thereto) included in the Company
10-Q; (y) liabilities or obligations arising pursuant to Insurance Contracts
entered into after December 31, 2000 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice; and (z) other liabilities or obligations which
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of
the Company to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  Section 4.11 Information to Be Supplied.

                  (a) The Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing thereof
and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting (as hereinafter defined),
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and all SEC regulations and with the WBCL.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any statements made or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by
Parent expressly for use therein.

                  Section 4.12 Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31,
2000, except as (i) disclosed in (x) the Company 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2000 included in the Company SEC Documents or provided for in the
financial statements (or notes thereto) included therein or (y) the Company 10-Q
included in the Company SEC Documents or provided for in the financial
statements (or notes thereto) included therein, or (ii) set forth on Section
4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
in all material respects conducted their business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, and since such date there has not been any
action, event, occurrence, development, change in method of doing business, or
state of circumstances or facts that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
December 31,


                                      -19-

2000, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has:

                  (a) changed (x) any accounting principles and methods from
those in effect at December 31, 2000, except as required by changes in GAAP or
statutory accounting practices prescribed by applicable insurance regulatory

or otherwise) other than (x) for claims, liabilities or obligations not in
excess of $500,000 individually or $1 million in the aggregate, (y) an insurance
claim arising in the ordinary course of business, and (z) ordinary course

                  (e) except for acquisitions in the ordinary course of the
investment activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with past

                  Section 4.19 Employees and Employee Benefits.

                  (a) Section 4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth an accurate, correct and complete list of every Employee Program existing
at the date hereof or within the five-year period prior thereto, maintained,
administered or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
with respect to which an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any contribution exists (except that employment Contracts set forth on
Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not be included on
Section 4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). Any Employee Program listed
in Section 4.15(a) or Section 4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is
referred to below as a "Company Employee Plan."

such Company Employee Plan, and (vii) any other written communications to any
employee or employees, or to any other individual or individuals, to the extent
that the provisions of such Company Employee Plan described therein differ
materially from such provisions as set forth or described in the other

                  (c) To the knowledge of the Company, each Company Employee
Plan which is (or ever was) intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified (or, if applicable, was so qualified upon its termination). Each
such Company Employee Plan has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service which states that such plan is so qualified, and on which the
Company and its Subsidiaries may currently rely.

                  (d) Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and with all applicable laws, and
no failure to so maintain any Company Employee Plan will result from the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event or events). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied material liability,
or any unpaid material fine, penalty or Tax, with respect to any Company
Employee Plan or any other Employee Program. There has been no "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code), or any breach of any duty under ERISA, any other applicable law or any
agreement, with respect to any Company Employee Plan which could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to material liability either directly or
indirectly (including, without limitation, through any obligation of
indemnification or contribution) for any damages, penalties, Taxes or any other
loss or expense. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made full and
timely payment of all contributions required to be made by it to each Company
Employee Plan by the terms of such plan or under the applicable law. There have
been no material violations of any reporting or disclosure requirements under
ERISA or the Code with respect to any Company Employee Plan, including any
requirement to file an annual return.

                  (e) No litigation or claim (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no governmental administrative proceeding, audit or
investigation, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with
respect to any Company Employee Plan.

                  (f) No Employee Program which has ever been maintained,
administered or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has ever had any obligation to make
a contribution, is or ever was (i) a "multiemployer plan", as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer plan", as described in Section 413(c) of
the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement", as defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA, (ii) subject to the funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code, (iii) subject to Title IV of ERISA, (iv) an unfunded
plan of deferred compensation, (v) a "voluntary

                                      -28-

employees' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code, or (vi) maintained outside of the United States.

                  (g) All health and medical benefit coverage, and all death
benefit coverage, under each Company Employee Plan is provided solely through
insurance. No Company Employee Plan provides health or medical coverage, life
insurance coverage, or coverage for any other welfare benefit to any Retiree,
except for continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or
Sections 601 to 608 of ERISA ("Continuation Coverage"). Any Continuation
Coverage provided under any Company Employee Plan is paid for solely by the
individual receiving such coverage. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability, with respect to any Company Employee Plan which
is funded wholly or partly through an insurance policy, in the nature of a
retroactive rate adjustment, a loss sharing arrangement or any other actual or
contingent liability arising from any event occurring on or before the Closing.

                  (h) No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any other individual, shall accrue or receive additional benefits, additional
credit for service, accelerated vesting or accelerated rights to payment of any
benefit under any Company Employee Plan, or become entitled to any severance,
termination allowance or similar payments or to the forgiveness of any
indebtedness, as a result of the execution and delivery of, or the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event or events). Such execution and delivery, or the
occurrence of such transactions, shall not result in any increase in the
contributions required to be made to any Company Employee Plan. No payment made
or contemplated under any Company Employee Plan, or by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, constituted, or would constitute, either (i) an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or (ii) a payment which
is not deductible by reason of Section 404 of the Code.

                  (i) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received services from (i) any individual whom the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has treated as an independent contractor, but
who should have been treated as a common-law employee, or (ii) any individual
who is treated as a leased employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 414(n) of the Code, and who must be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether any Company Employee Plan meets the requirements
of Section 414(n)(3) of the Code which apply to such Company Employee Plan.

                  (j) Except for the adoption of (i) an amendment to the ESOP or
(ii) a plan amendment which is needed to bring the plan documents into
conformity with statutory or regulatory changes enacted or promulgated in recent
years and as to which the period referred to in Section 401(b) of the Code will
not have ended prior to December 31, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is under any obligation (express or implied) to modify any Company
Employee Plan, or to establish any new Employee Program. The Company or one of
its Subsidiaries has expressly reserved to itself the right to amend, modify or
terminate each Company Employee Plan (and any service or funding agreement or
arrangement for each Company Employee

                                      -29-
<PAGE>   34
Plan), at any time without liability or penalty to itself (other than routine
expenses). No Company Employee Plan requires the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue to employ any employee, director or officer, or to
continue to use the services of any independent contractor. No Company Employee
Plan has invested in (i) insurance or annuity Contracts issued by an insurance
company with an A.M. Best Company, Inc. rating of claims-paying ability below
A++ or (ii) except for any Company Employee Plan which constitutes an "employee
stock ownership plan", within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code (an
"ESOP"), any employer securities or employer real property.

                  (k) There has been no amendment, interpretation or
announcement by the Company relating to any Company Employee Plan which would
materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of
expense incurred with respect to that plan for the year ended December 31, 2000.

                  (l) No ERISA Affiliate has any unpaid material liability,
fine, penalty or Tax with respect to any Employee Program for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries could be liable.

                  (m) Since January 1, 1998, there have been no repricings,
cancellations and regrants, or substitutions of any options to purchase Company
Common Shares awarded under any Company Employee Plan.

                  Section 4.20 Investment Securities. Attached as Section 4.20
of the Disclosure Schedule are the reports regarding the stocks, bonds and other
securities (the "Investment Securities") held in the Company's investment
portfolio, each of which reports is true and complete as of the date indicated
thereon. The Investment Securities were acquired by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. The acquisition and ownership
by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the Investment Securities complies with
all applicable insurance, trust and other Laws. The Company has good and valid
title to all such Investment Securities shown as assets in the balance sheet
included in the Company 10-Q (unless disposed of in the ordinary course of
business after the date of such balance sheet), free and clear of all Liens
except for restrictions in respect of deposits, statutory premium reserve
requirements and statutory pledges with state regulatory authorities disclosed
in the Company SEC Documents. None of the Company's Investment Securities are in
default in the payment of principal or interest or dividends or are materially
impaired. The NAIC Annual Convention Statements of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries contain a complete description of all securities of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries on deposit with each state insurance department as of
December 31, 2000.

                  Section 4.21 Compliance with Laws. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have all material licenses, permits and qualifications necessary to
conduct their businesses and own their properties in each jurisdiction in which
the Company or its Subsidiaries currently do business or own property, or in
which such license, permit or qualification is otherwise required. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all Laws
applicable to their businesses. The present use by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of their respective properties, and the business conducted

                                      -30-
<PAGE>   35
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, does not violate any such Laws, in each
case except for such violations as would not be reasonably likely, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of violation of any Law
or is in default with respect to any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity which would affect any of their respective
assets, properties or operations, except for such violations or defaults as
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received notice of any investigation or review being undertaken by, or
notice of any intention to conduct an investigation or review from, any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of
their officers or employees (in their capacities as such), and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no such investigation or review is threatened. To the knowledge
of the Company, since January 1, 1996, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
timely filed all insurance related reports and returns required by Law and all
such returns and reports are true and correct in all material respects, and
there are no material deficiencies with respect to such filings or submissions.
Section 4.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule indicates the most recent date
of the last completed insurance regulatory examination and audit, regular or
special, as the case may be, as to the Company and each of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries for the jurisdictions listed therein, and a copy of the most recent
report of such examination has heretofore been delivered to Parent. There is no
agreement or understanding between the Company or any of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any regulatory authority, on the other hand,
concerning the payment of dividends by the Company or such Company Insurance
Subsidiary or the maintenance of any NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information
System Ratio. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, employee or agent of any of them,
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has (i) used any funds for
unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful payments relating
to political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic
governmental official or employee or to any foreign or domestic political party
or campaign or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended, or (iii) made any other unlawful payment.

                  Section 4.22 Insurance Matters.

                  (a) Policy Forms; Rates; Other filings. Each form of insurance
policy, policy endorsement or amendment, reinsurance Contract, application form
and sales material issued by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries in any
jurisdiction since December 31, 1999, was, as of its respective date of
issuance, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and,
to the extent required under applicable Law, has been approved (or has been
submitted for approval, which is pending, or has been filed and not objected to
within the period provided for objection), where required by the appropriate
insurance regulatory authorities of such jurisdiction. Any premium rates with
respect to insurance or reinsurance policies or Contracts currently issued by
the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries which are required to be
filed with or approved by any Governmental Entity have been so filed or approved
in accordance with applicable Law, and such premiums charged thereon conform
thereto, except where the

                                      -31-
<PAGE>   36
failure to file, obtain such approval or conform would not be reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Since December 31, 1999, the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries have
made all filings with statistical agents and rating organizations required by
applicable regulatory authorities, except where the failure to make such filings
would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Underwriting Management and Administration Agreements. All
underwriting management and/or administration agreements entered into by the
Company and any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries as now in force are set
forth in Section 4.22(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and, to the extent
required under applicable Law, are in a form acceptable to applicable regulatory
authorities (or have been submitted for approval which is pending, or have been
filed and not objected to by such authorities within the period provided for
objection), except where the failure to obtain such approval or make such filing
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Reinsurance and Retrocession.

                  (i) Section 4.22(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
         contains a true and complete list of all Contracts, treaties or
         arrangements entered into after December 31, 1990 (including any
         terminated or expired treaty or agreement under which there remains any
         outstanding liability with respect to paid or unpaid case reserves in
         an individual amount in excess of $200,000 regarding ceding or
         assumption of reinsurance, coinsurance, excess insurance, or
         retrocessions ("Reinsurance Contracts")) to which any of the Company
         Insurance Subsidiaries is a party or by or to which any of them are
         bound or subject, as each such Reinsurance Contract may have been
         amended, modified or supplemented. To the knowledge of the Company,
         each of the foregoing Reinsurance Contracts is a valid and binding
         obligation of the parties thereto, is in full force and effect and is
         enforceable in accordance with its terms. None of the Company Insurance
         Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party
         thereto is in default in any material respect with respect to any such
         Reinsurance Contract. There are no material disputes as to reinsurance
         or retrocessional coverage pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
         threatened with respect to any such Reinsurance Contract. No such
         Reinsurance Contract contains any provision providing that any such
         other party thereto may terminate, cancel or commute the same by reason
         of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (ii) Except as reflected on Schedule F of the Company
         Statutory Financial Statements, each of the Company Insurance
         Subsidiaries is entitled under applicable Law to take full credit in
         its Company Statutory Financial Statements for all amounts recoverable
         by it pursuant to any Reinsurance Contract, and all such amounts
         recoverable have been properly recorded in the books and records of
         account of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries and are properly
         reflected in the Company Statutory Financial Statements. To the

                                      -32-
<PAGE>   37
         knowledge of the Company, all such amounts recoverable by the Company
         or any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries are fully collectible in
         due course. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         received notice that any other party to any Reinsurance Contracts
         intends not to perform under any such Reinsurance Contracts, and, to
         the knowledge of the Company, the financial condition of any other
         party to any Reinsurance Contract pursuant to which the Company and its
         Subsidiaries have ceded any premiums is not impaired to the extent that
         a default thereunder is reasonably anticipated.

                  Section 4.23 Directors' and Officers' Insurance Policies. The
Company does not have in effect any directors' and officers' insurance policies.

                  Section 4.24 Environmental Matters.

notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons, complaint or
order has been received or made by, and no investigation, action, claim, suit,
proceeding or review is pending or threatened by any Person against, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect to any applicable Environmental Law (as
hereinafter defined). Except as would not be reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and
its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and (ii) there are no liabilities or obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, direct or indirect, determined, determinable or otherwise,
arising under or relating to any Environmental Law (including, without
limitation, liabilities or obligations relating to divested properties or
businesses or predecessor entities).

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental
Laws" means any international, national, provincial, regional, Federal, state,
local, municipal and foreign Laws, judicial decisions, decrees, regulations,
ordinances, rules, judgments, orders, codes, injunctions, permits or
governmental agreements or other requirements relating to human health and
safety, to the environment, including, without limitation, natural resources, or

by-products or additives, asbestos, asbestos-containing material,
polychlorinated biphenyl's, radioactive material, hazardous substances or
wastes, or any other substance (including any product) regulated as harmful or
potentially harmful to human health or the environment.

                  Section 4.25 Title to Property; Leases. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have good, marketable and valid title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, or valid right under Contract to use, all of the real and tangible
personal property purported to be owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or used in or reasonably necessary for the conduct of their
respective businesses, free and clear of all Liens (collectively, the "Company
Assets"). The tangible Company Assets, taken as a whole, have been maintained in
a reasonably prudent manner, are in good operating condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted), and no maintenance with respect thereto has
been

                                      -33-

deferred or delayed in a manner that is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 4.26 Real Property. Section 4.26 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a description that is complete and accurate in all
material respects of all real property and interests in real property owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all leases of real property to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them holds a
leasehold interest that in any individual case involves the payment, pursuant to
the terms of such lease, by or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of
more than $50,000 annually (collectively, "Real Property"). There are no persons
other than the Company and its Subsidiaries in possession of any of the Real
Property or any portion thereof and there are no Contracts granting to any
person or persons other than the Company and its Subsidiaries the right of use
or occupancy of any portion of the Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is obligated under or bound by any option, right of first
refusal, purchase Contract, or other instrument to sell or otherwise dispose of
any Real Property or any other interest in any Real Property.

                  Section 4.27 Absence of Bank, Savings and Loan or Investment

                  Section 4.28 Insurance Ratings. To the Company's knowledge,
there is no reason to believe that (i) any rating from A.M. Best Company, Inc.
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any financial strength
rating by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be likely to be modified downward, qualified (other than
in a positive way), lowered or placed under surveillance for a possible
downgrade for any reason.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGERSUB

                  Except as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Schedule attached
hereto, which Parent Disclosure Schedule identifies the Section (or if
applicable, subsection) to which such exception relates, Parent and MergerSub
jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that:

                  Section 5.1 Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and
MergerSub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. Parent is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has
heretofore delivered to the Company true and complete copies of each of the
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of MergerSub, all as currently in effect.

                  Section 5.2 Corporate Authorization. Each of Parent and
MergerSub has full corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and MergerSub and the
consummation by each of them of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
either of them, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
MergerSub are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and MergerSub and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and MergerSub and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and MergerSub,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

                  Section 5.3 Governmental Authorization. The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and MergerSub of this Agreement, and the
consummation by Parent and MergerSub of the transactions contemplated hereby
require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity
other than (i) the filing of the Articles of Merger in accordance with the WBCL;
(ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (iii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; and (iv) the
filing of the applications and notices with applicable Commissioners of
Insurance and the approval of such applications or the grant of required
licenses by such authorities or the expiration of any applicable waiting periods
thereunder, in each case as listed on Exhibit C hereto (collectively, the
"Parent Government Approvals"); provided, however, that no representation is
made with respect to any of the foregoing that Parent, MergerSub or the Company
may be required to obtain because of the specific legal or regulatory status of
the Company or any other facts that

                                      -37-
<PAGE>   42
specifically relate to Company or any business engaged in by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

                  Section 5.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Parent and MergerSub of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and MergerSub of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the restated certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of MergerSub, (ii) subject to receipt of the Parent Government Approvals,
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
Law, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) constitute a breach or default (an event
which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or
default) under or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any right or obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
to a loss of any benefit or status to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit or other similar authorization
held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other
than, in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), any such items that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) be reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent or materially impair the ability
of Parent or MergerSub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  Section 5.5 Information to Be Supplied. The information to be
supplied in writing by Parent expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing thereof and at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

                  Section 5.6 Finders' Fees. Except for Merrill Lynch & Co.,
whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary who might be entitled to any fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

                  Section 5.7 Financing. Parent has and at the Effective Time
will have sufficient funds (i) to enable it to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and any other agreements contemplated hereby, and (ii) to pay all
of the related fees and expenses of Parent and MergerSub in connection with the
foregoing.

                  Section 5.8 Ownership of Company Common Shares. Other than as
a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements entered into by and between Parent and certain shareholders of the
Company dated the date hereof pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to
vote their Company Common Shares in favor of adopting and approving this
Agreement and the Merger, as

                                      -38-
<PAGE>   43
of the date hereof, neither Parent, MergerSub, nor, to Parent's knowledge, any
Affiliate of Parent is a "significant shareholder" of the Company as that term
is defined in the WBCL.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                            COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

                  The Company agrees that:

ability of the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries to obtain any
consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization required to be obtained

otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire any of
its securities or any securities of any of its Subsidiaries, except for (i)

intercompany dividends paid by Subsidiaries of the Company to the Company in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and subject to

provided that nothing in this Section 6.1(h) shall prohibit the Company from

Plan which prior to the Effective Time constitutes an

                                      -40-
<PAGE>   45
ESOP in such manner as Parent shall reasonably request pursuant to Section 6.5
hereof; or

                  (i) agree or otherwise commit to do any of the foregoing.

Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that any action described in clauses
(a) through (i) above which is taken by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
after receipt of the prior written consent of Parent shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
herein.

                  Section 6.2 Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall
cause a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") to be
duly called and held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (taking into account
the requirements of all applicable Laws). Except as expressly provided in this
Section 6.2, (i) the Company's Board of Directors shall submit this Agreement to
the shareholders of the Company and shall recommend to its shareholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Company
Recommendation"), and (ii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit the Company Shareholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations under this Section 6.2 to
duly call and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company
of any Acquisition Proposal or the withholding, withdrawal or modification by
the Board of Directors of the Company Recommendation. The Board of Directors of
the Company shall be permitted to (x) withhold the Company Recommendation or (y)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation, in
each case only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment (after consulting with its outside legal counsel) that such
action is necessary for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

                  Section 6.3 Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation.

                  (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and their officers, directors, employees, financial advisers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisers, representatives and agents (collectively,
"Representatives") to cease and cause to be terminated immediately any
discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Representatives,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) the submission, making or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) initiate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate or in
furtherance of any inquiries or the submission, making or announcement of any
proposal that constitutes, or may be reasonably expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of the Company's equity securities
or (iv) enter into any agreement,

                                      -41-
<PAGE>   46
arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that at any time before the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, solely in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from the breach of this Section
6.3 and following delivery to Parent of notice of such Acquisition Proposal in
compliance with its obligations under Section 6.3(c) hereof, the Company may (i)
furnish information to the party making the Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, initiate
and/or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding the Acquisition Proposal
and/or (iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of the Company's equity securities to the
third party making the Acquisition Proposal, but only if (x) the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines in its good faith judgment (A)
after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary
for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (B) after consultation with a financial adviser of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) prior to furnishing any information
to such Person, such Person shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with the Company on terms no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent dated as of April 9,
2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

                  (b) Unless the Company's Board of Directors has previously
withheld, withdrawn, or is concurrently therewith withdrawing, the Company
Recommendation, neither the Company's Board of Directors nor any committee
thereof shall recommend any Acquisition Proposal to the Company's shareholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.3(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Company's Board of Directors from
complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or making any disclosure required by applicable Law.

                  (c) Within one day following the date of receipt by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective directors,
officers, agents or advisers) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or
contacts concerning, or any request for information or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
request for a waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement, by
any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal or indicates that it is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall (i) notify Parent
that a Person has made or may be considering making an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) notify Parent of the identity of such Person and of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, contact, or request, and (iii)
provide copies of any written materials received by the Company in respect of
the foregoing. The Company agrees that it shall keep Parent reasonably informed
of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, contact or request, and keep Parent
reasonably informed as to the material details of any information requested of
or provided by the Company and as to the material details of all discussions

                                      -42-
<PAGE>   47
or negotiations with respect to any such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. The Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other Person or
group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously
provided to Parent.

                  (d) Upon notice and in accordance with the terms of Section
9.1 hereof, the Company may terminate this Agreement at any time before the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained if (i) the Company's Board of Directors
shall have authorized the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to enter into a binding agreement concerning a transaction that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company notifies Parent that it
intends to enter into such agreement, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such agreement and provides Parent with four Business Days (during
which period of four Business Days the Company shall refrain from entering into
such Agreement) to propose and agree to enter into a modification of this
Agreement, (iii) the Company's Board of Directors has duly considered any
proposals that Parent may make during the four Business Day period described in
(ii) above and the Company has fully cooperated with Parent during such four
Business Day period (including, without limitation, by complying with Section
6.3(c) of this Agreement) and the Company, after consideration of any proposals
made by Parent, determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal, (iv) Parent has received the Termination Fee (as hereinafter
defined) contemplated by Section 9.3(b), and (v) the Company intends, in good
faith, to enter into a definitive agreement to effect the Superior Proposal
immediately following such termination.

                  Section 6.4 Certain Litigation. The Company agrees that it
shall not settle any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the
Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of the Company relating to
the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent. In
addition, the Company shall not cooperate with any third party that may
hereafter seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger and shall
cooperate with Parent and MergerSub to resist any such effort to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger.

                  Section 6.5 Certain Tax and Company Employee Plan Matters. The
Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, prepare and file all Tax
Returns of or including the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that are required to
be filed (with extensions) on or before the Effective Time and shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns will be made
and filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company, prior to but
effective as of the Effective Time, shall adopt such amendments to each Company
Employee Plan which prior to the Effective Time constitutes an ESOP, in such
manner as Parent shall reasonably request to convert such ESOP into a plan which
is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code but which is no longer an ESOP.

                  Section 6.6 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or MergerSub, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of
the Company prior to

                                      -43-
<PAGE>   48
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations and the operations of the
Subsidiaries of the Company.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                 OTHER COVENANTS

                  Section 7.1 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

                  (a) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect in accordance with their terms all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") as provided in either (x) their respective articles of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) set forth in Section 4.1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 7.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and/or (y) the indemnification agreements in effect as of the date
hereof set forth in Section 7.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, copies of
which have been delivered to Parent. In the event that, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company presents to Parent a proposal for the purchase of a policy for
directors' and officers' insurance covering actions of directors and officers
prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees to consider approval of such
proposal, provided that (i) the aggregate cost to be incurred by the Company in
connection with the purchase of such policy does not exceed $100,000 and (ii)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to
procure any such policy subsequent to the Effective Time. To the extent that
Parent approves in writing a proposal for the purchase of directors' and
officers' insurance as contemplated by the preceding sentence of this Section
7.1(a), the existence of such policy at the Effective Time shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
herein.

                  (b) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section 7.1 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and his or
her heirs and legal representatives.

                  Section 7.2 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each party agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, including, without limitation, (i) preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions and filings and obtaining as promptly as
practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third
party and/or any

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   49
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) taking all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, permits and authorizations (including, without limitation, making
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and supplying as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and taking all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable), and (iii) defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed. Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall require or be construed to require
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree to sell,
license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a
specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of,
any assets of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or the
conduct of their business in a specified manner, whether as a condition to
obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any other Person or for any
other reason.

                  Section 7.3 Certain Filings; Cooperation in Receipt of
Consents.

                  (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. The
Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement, and any revision, amendment or supplement thereto, prior to
filing or transmission of such material to the SEC, and shall not so file or
transmit any such material to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the
Company as promptly as practicable (taking into account the requirements of all
applicable Laws) and, if necessary, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so
mailed, to promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. The
Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
request by the SEC for revision or amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon or requests by the SEC for additional information, and shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on any responses to such
comments or requests prior to filing with, or transmission of such material to,
the SEC, and shall not so file or transmit any such material to which Parent
reasonably objects. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to either party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, and the Company shall promptly file an appropriate

                                      -45-
<PAGE>   50
amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to Shareholders
of the Company. The Company shall not mail to its shareholders any Proxy
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably
objects.

                  (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in
(i) determining whether any other action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) seeking any such other actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making
any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking promptly to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.
Each party shall permit the other party to review, in advance of any filing or
submission, and comment on any communication proposed to be filed or submitted
by it with, and shall consult with each other in advance of any hearing, meeting
or conference with, any Governmental Entity, A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's,
Moody's or other rating agency, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the
applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such hearings, meetings and
conferences, in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

                  Section 7.4 Public Announcements. The parties shall consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation.

                  Section 7.5 Access to Information; Notification of Certain
Matters.

                  (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisers, auditors and other authorized representatives full access at
all reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice to their respective offices,
properties, books and records, Contracts, accountants, actuaries, management and
consultants, (ii) promptly furnish or make available to Parent, its counsel,

and (iii) agrees not to bring any action related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any other court (except to enforce the
judgment of such courts). Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
