                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT  AND  PLAN  OF  MERGER,  dated  as of  February  25,  2006  (this
"Agreement"),  by  and  among  NATIONAL  GRID  PLC,  a  public  limited  company
incorporated  under the laws of  England  and  Wales  with  registration  number
4031152 ("Parent"), NATIONAL GRID US8 INC. a New York corporation ("Merger Sub")
and KEYSPAN CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("KeySpan").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS,  the Boards of  Directors  of Parent,  Merger Sub and KeySpan have
each  approved,  and  deem it  advisable  and in the  best  interests  of  their
respective  stockholders  to consummate,  the business  combination  transaction
provided  for herein  pursuant  to which  Merger  Sub would  merge with and into
KeySpan (the  "Merger"),  with KeySpan as the surviving  entity,  as a result of
which Parent will, directly or indirectly, own all of the issued and outstanding
common shares of KeySpan; and

     WHEREAS,   Parent,   Merger  Sub  and  KeySpan   desire  to  make   certain
representations,  warranties  covenants and  agreements  in connection  with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and the  respective
representations,  warranties,  covenants and  agreements  set forth herein,  the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1.  Effective  Time of the  Merger.  Subject  to the  provisions  of this
Agreement,  a certificate of merger (the  "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly
prepared and  executed by KeySpan as the  Surviving  Corporation  (as defined in
Section 1.3) and thereafter  delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
New York for filing,  in such form as is required by and executed in  accordance
with the New York Business  Corporation  Law (the "NYBCL"),  on the Closing Date
(as defined in Section 1.2).  The Merger shall become  effective upon the filing
of the  Certificate  of Merger with the  Secretary  of State of the State of New
York or at such  subsequent time thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of
Merger (the "Effective Time").

     1.2. Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m.  (New York City time) on the date (the  "Closing  Date")  that is the
fifth business day after the  satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law)
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding  conditions  that, by their
terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date),  unless another time or date is
agreed to by the parties  hereto.  The  Closing  shall be held at the offices of
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue,  New York, New York 10017,
unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

     1.3.  Effects of the Merger.  At and after the Effective  Time,  Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into KeySpan and the  separate  existence of Merger Sub
shall cease.  The Merger will have the effects set forth in ss.906 of the NYBCL.

<PAGE>


As used in this Agreement,  "Constituent Corporations" shall mean each of Merger
Sub and KeySpan,  and "Surviving  Corporation" shall mean KeySpan,  at and after
the Effective Time, as the surviving corporation in the Merger.

     1.4.   Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  By-Laws.   The  Certificate  of
Incorporation  of Merger  Sub as in effect  immediately  prior to the  Effective
Time,  shall be the Certificate of  Incorporation  of the Surviving  Corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation  Certificate of Incorporation") except that the name
of the Surviving  Corporation shall be changed to KeySpan. The By-laws of Merger
Sub as in effect  immediately  prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws
of the Surviving  Corporation (the "Surviving  Corporation By-laws") except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to KeySpan.

     1.5. Directors and Officers.  The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to  the  Effective  Time  shall  be  the  initial  directors  of  the  Surviving
Corporation,  each  to  hold  office  in  accordance  with  the  certificate  of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation.  At the Effective Time,
the officers of the  Surviving  Corporation  shall be the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  together with any additional  officers
as may be agreed upon prior thereto by Parent and KeySpan or as may be appointed
thereafter.

                                   ARTICLE II

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

     2.1.  Effect on Capital Stock.  As of the Effective  Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

     (a) Merger  Consideration.  Each share of common  stock par value $0.01 per
share of KeySpan ("KeySpan Common Stock"),  including,  without limitation, each
restricted  share of KeySpan  Common  Stock  granted  under the KeySpan  Benefit
Plans,  that is issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of KeySpan  Common Stock to be cancelled in  accordance  with
Section  2.1(c)),  shall  automatically  be converted  into the right to receive
$42.00 in cash per share (such per share  amount,  as  adjusted  pursuant to the
following sentence, the "Merger  Consideration"),  without interest,  payable to
the holder of such shares of KeySpan Common Stock, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.2, of the certificate  that formerly  evidenced such share
of KeySpan  Common  Stock.  All such  shares of KeySpan  Common  Stock,  when so
converted,  shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be cancelled
and  retired  and  shall  cease to  exist,  and  each  holder  of a  certificate
representing  any such  shares of KeySpan  Common  Stock shall cease to have any
rights  with   respect   thereto,   except  the  right  to  receive  the  Merger
Consideration therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 2.2.

     (b)  Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock.  Each share of common stock par
value  $0.01 per share of Merger  Sub  ("Merger  Sub Common  Stock")  issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable share of KeySpan Common Stock.


                                       2
<PAGE>


     (c)  Cancellation of Certain  KeySpan Capital Stock.  Each share of KeySpan
Common  Stock  that is  owned  as  treasury  stock  by  KeySpan  or owned by any
wholly-owned  Subsidiary of KeySpan, and all shares of KeySpan Common Stock that
are owned by Parent,  Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned  subsidiary of Parent
shall be  canceled  and  retired  and shall  cease to exist and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

     2.2. Surrender of Certificates.
          --------------------------

     (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company  reasonably  acceptable to KeySpan to act as the exchange agent
(the  "Exchange  Agent")  for the holders of shares of KeySpan  Common  Stock in
connection  with the Merger and shall enter into an agreement  with the Exchange
Agent which is  reasonably  acceptable  to KeySpan.  As of the  Effective  Time,
Parent shall deposit,  or shall cause to be deposited,  with the Exchange Agent,
in trust for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in
book entry form which  immediately  prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares
of KeySpan Common Stock (collectively,  the "KeySpan Certificates"),  cash in an
aggregate  amount  equal to the  product  of (i) the number of shares of KeySpan
Common Stock issued and  outstanding at the Effective Time (other than shares of
KeySpan Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) and (ii)
the Merger  Consideration.  Any funds  deposited  with the Exchange  Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

     (b)  Exchange  Procedures.  As soon as  reasonably  practicable  after  the
Effective Time,  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the  "Certificates")  which represented
shares of KeySpan Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose
shares  were  converted  into the  right to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of  transmittal  which shall  specify that
delivery  shall  be  effected,  and  risk  of  loss  and  title  to the  KeySpan
Certificates  shall pass, only upon delivery of the KeySpan  Certificates to the
Exchange  Agent,  and which  letter  shall be in such  form and have such  other
provisions as KeySpan may  reasonably  specify  prior to the Effective  Time and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the KeySpan Certificates
in  exchange  for the  Merger  Consideration  to which such  holder is  entitled
pursuant  to  Section  2.1.  Upon  surrender  of  a  KeySpan   Certificate   for
cancellation  to the Exchange  Agent  together with such letter of  transmittal,
duly executed,  completed in accordance with the instructions  thereto, and such
other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such
KeySpan  Certificate  shall be  entitled  to receive in  exchange  therefor  the
aggregate  Merger  Consideration  which  such  holder  has the right to  receive
pursuant to Section 2.1 (after taking into account all shares of KeySpan  Common
Stock  surrendered  by such holder) and the  Certificate  so  surrendered  shall
forthwith be cancelled.  Until so surrendered,  each Certificate will represent,
from and  after  the  Effective  Time,  only the  right to  receive  the  Merger
Consideration  in cash as  contemplated  by this  Article II. No interest  shall
accrue  or be paid on the  amounts  payable  pursuant  to this  Article  II upon
surrender of a Certificate.

     (c) No Further Ownership Rights in KeySpan Common Stock. From and after the
Effective  Time,  the holders of KeySpan  Common Stock  outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective  Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of  KeySpan  Common  Stock  except  as  otherwise  provided  herein or by
applicable law. The Merger  Consideration paid in exchange for shares of KeySpan
Common  Stock in  accordance  with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been


                                       3
<PAGE>


paid in full  satisfaction  of all rights  pertaining  to such shares of KeySpan
Common Stock previously  represented by such  Certificates.  As of the Effective
Time,  the stock transfer books of KeySpan shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of KeySpan Common Stock that were  outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,  Certificates are presented to the
Surviving  Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,  such  Certificates
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided for in this Article II.

     (d)  Termination  of Exchange  Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains  undistributed to the holders of KeySpan  Certificates for twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving  Corporation,  upon
demand,  and any  holders  of  KeySpan  Certificates  who have  not  theretofore
complied  with this  Article  II shall  thereafter  look  only to the  Surviving
Corporation for payment,  as general creditors  thereof,  of their claim for the
Merger Consideration,  without interest, to which such holders would be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1.

     (e) No  Liability.  None of Parent,  Merger Sub,  KeySpan or the  Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
for  any  amount  properly  delivered  to a  public  official  pursuant  to  any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     (f) Lost,  Stolen or  Destroyed  Certificates.  If any KeySpan  Certificate
shall have been lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such KeySpan  Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed  and, if required by the  Surviving  Corporation,  the posting by such
Person of a bond in such  reasonable  amount as the  Surviving  Corporation  may
direct as  indemnity  against  claim that may be made against it with respect to
such KeySpan  Certificate,  the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed KeySpan Certificate the Merger  Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

     (g) Withholding.  Each of the Exchange Agent,  KeySpan,  Parent, Merger Sub
and the  Surviving  Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold  from
payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
KeySpan  Common Stock such amounts as they are  respectively  required to deduct
and  withhold  with  respect to the making of such  payment  under the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended,  (the  "Code") and the rules and  regulations
promulgated thereunder,  or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld,  such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all  purposes  of this  Agreement  as having  been paid to the holder of the
shares  of  KeySpan  Common  Stock  in  respect  of  which  such  deduction  and
withholding was made.

     (h) Transfers of Ownership.  If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered  Certificate formerly
evidencing shares of KeySpan Common Stock is registered,  it will be a condition
of payment that the  Certificate  so surrendered  will be properly  endorsed and
otherwise  in proper  form for  transfer  and that the  Person  requesting  such
payment will have paid to Parent or any agent  designated  by it any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the amount specified in Section


                                       4
<PAGE>


2.1(a)  to a  Person  other  than  the  registered  holder  of the  Certificates
surrendered,  or  established  to the  satisfaction  of the  Parent or any agent
designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

     (i) Further Action. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
Parent and the Surviving  Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of KeySpan and Merger Sub,  any deeds,  bills of sale,
assignments  or  assurances  and to take and do,  in the name and on  behalf  of

     (e) Reports and Financial Statements.
         ---------------------------------

          (i)  KeySpan  and its  Subsidiaries  have  filed  each  form,  report,
     schedule,  registration  statement,  registration exemption, if applicable,
     definitive proxy statement and other document (together with all amendments


                                       8
<PAGE>


     thereof and supplements  thereto) required to be filed by KeySpan or any of
     its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the
     rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") or the
     Exchange Act with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  since
     January 1, 2003 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been
     amended or supplemented, the "KeySpan SEC Reports"). As of their respective
     dates,  the KeySpan SEC  Reports  (A)  complied as to form in all  material
     respects with the  requirements  of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
     if  applicable,  as the case may be,  and,  to the  extent  in  effect  and
     applicable, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"), and (B) did not contain
     any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact
     required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which they were made,  not
     misleading.

          (ii) KeySpan has provided to Parent copies of all correspondence  sent
     to or received from the SEC by or on behalf of KeySpan and its Subsidiaries

     15d-14  under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules
     and  regulations  of the SEC  promulgated  thereunder  with  respect to the
     KeySpan SEC Reports.  For purposes of the  preceding  sentence,  "principal
     executive  officer"  and  "principal  financial  officer"  shall  have  the
     meanings  given  to such  terms in SOX.  Since  the  effectiveness  of SOX,
     neither  KeySpan nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has arranged any outstanding
     "extensions  of credit"  to  directors  or  executive  officers  within the
     meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

          (iv) The  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  and  unaudited

     Financial  Statements")  complied as to form in all material  respects with
     the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto,  were
     prepared in accordance  with United States  generally  accepted  accounting
     principles  ("GAAP")  applied on a  consistent  basis  during  the  periods
     involved  (except as may be indicated  therein or in the notes  thereto and
     except with  respect to  unaudited  statements  as  permitted  by rules and
     regulations  promulgated  by the SEC) and fairly present  (subject,  in the
     case of the unaudited interim financial  statements,  to normal,  recurring
     year-end audit adjustments that have not or are not reasonably  expected to
     result in a Material Adverse Effect on KeySpan) the consolidated  financial
     position of KeySpan and its consolidated  Subsidiaries as of the respective
     dates thereof and the  consolidated  results of their  operations  and cash
     flows for the respective  periods then ended. No restatement of the KeySpan
     Financial Statements has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur.

          (v) All filings (other than immaterial filings) required to be made by
     KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2003 and in the case of
     any filing made pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,

     written  notification  of a (x)  "reportable  condition"  or (y)  "material
     weakness" in its internal  controls.  The terms "reportable  condition" and

     Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof.

          (vii) The management of KeySpan has (x) designed  disclosure  controls

     supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to KeySpan,
     including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of
     KeySpan by others within those entities and (y) has disclosed, based on its
     most recent  evaluation of internal  control over  financial  reporting (as

     auditors  and the audit  committee of the Board of Directors of KeySpan (A)
     all  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the design or
     operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
     likely to adversely affect KeySpan's ability to record, process,  summarize
     and  report  financial  information  and  (B)  any  fraud,  whether  or not
     material,   that  involves   management  or  other  employees  who  have  a

          (viii) Since  December 31,  2003,  (x) neither  KeySpan nor any of its
     Subsidiaries  nor, to the  Knowledge  of the  Executive  Officers  (for the
     purposes of this Section  3.1(e)(viii),  as such term is defined in Section
     3b-7 of the Exchange  Act) of KeySpan,  any  director,  officer,  employee,
     auditor, accountant or representative of KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries

     (h)  Absence  of  Certain   Changes  or  Events;   Absence  of  Undisclosed
Liabilities.

     (i) Since December 31, 2005,  KeySpan and its  Subsidiaries  have conducted
their  business in the  ordinary  course of business  and no event has  occurred
which has had, and no fact or circumstance  exists that has resulted in or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on KeySpan.

     (ii) Neither  KeySpan nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has any  liabilities or
obligations  (whether  absolute,  contingent,  accrued or otherwise) of a nature
required by GAAP to be  reflected in a  consolidated  corporate  balance  sheet,
except  liabilities,  obligations or contingencies  that are accrued or reserved
against in the consolidated  financial statements of KeySpan or are reflected in
the notes  thereto for the year ended  December 31, 2005,  that were incurred in
the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2005. Neither KeySpan nor any
of its  Subsidiaries  is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture,  off-balance  sheet  partnership  or any similar  contract or
arrangement  (including any contract relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among KeySpan and any of its  Subsidiaries,  on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated  affiliate,  including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person,  on the other hand or any  "off-balance  sheet
arrangements"  (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),  where
the result,  purpose or effect of such  contract is to avoid  disclosure  of any
material  transaction  involving,  or material liabilities of, KeySpan or any of
its  Subsidiaries,  in KeySpan's or any of its  Subsidiary's  audited  financial
statements or other KeySpan SEC Reports.

     (i) Board Approval.  The Board of Directors of KeySpan, by resolutions duly
adopted at a meeting  duly  called and held and not  subsequently  rescinded  or
modified in any way (the "KeySpan Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that
this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of KeySpan
and its  stockholders,  (ii) adopted this  Agreement and approved the Merger and
(iii)  recommended  that the  stockholders  of KeySpan adopt this  Agreement and
approve the Merger.

     (j) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding  shares of KeySpan  Common  Stock is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of KeySpan  capital stock  necessary to adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Required KeySpan Vote").

     (k)  Takeover  Statutes.  No "fair  price,"  "moratorium,"  "control  share
acquisition" or other similar  antitakeover  statute or regulation enacted under
state or federal laws in the United  States  applicable to KeySpan is applicable

     (l) Brokers or Finders.  No agent,  broker,  investment  banker,  financial
advisor  or other  firm or  Person is or will be  entitled  to any  broker's  or
finder's fee or any other similar  commission  or fee in connection  with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on arrangements made by or
on behalf of KeySpan,  except Lazard  Freres & Co. LLC (the  "KeySpan  Financial
Advisor"),  whose fees and expenses will be paid by KeySpan in  accordance  with
KeySpan's agreement with such firm, based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of KeySpan and previously disclosed to Parent.

     (m) Opinion of KeySpan Financial Advisor.  KeySpan has received the opinion
of KeySpan Financial  Advisor,  dated the date of this Agreement,  to the effect
that,  as of such  date,  the  Merger  Consideration  is fair to the  holders of
KeySpan Common Stock from a financial point of view, a copy of which opinion has
been made available to Parent.

     (n) Taxes.  Each of KeySpan and each of its Subsidiaries  have timely filed
with the relevant taxing authority all material Tax Returns required to be filed
by any of them,  and have  timely  paid (or  KeySpan  has  timely  paid on their
behalf),  or have set up an adequate  reserve  for the payment of, all  material
Taxes in accordance with GAAP.  Such Tax Returns are true,  correct and complete
in all material respects. No material deficiencies or other claims for any Taxes
have  been  proposed,  asserted  or  assessed  against  KeySpan  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for in accordance with GAAP. There
are no Liens  with  respect to Taxes  upon any of the  assets or  properties  of
either KeySpan or its Subsidiaries, other than with respect to Taxes not yet due
and payable,  or for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings  and for which  adequate  reserves have been  provided.  There is no
outstanding  audit,  assessment,  dispute,  claim or  administrative or judicial
proceeding  concerning  any  material  Tax  liability  of  KeySpan or any of its
Subsidiaries either within KeySpan's knowledge or claimed,  pending or raised by
any Governmental Entity in writing.  All material Taxes required to be withheld,
collected  or  deposited  by  or  with  respect  to  KeySpan  and  each  of  its
Subsidiaries  have been timely withheld,  collected or deposited as the case may
be, and to the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.
The tax years in the  principal  jurisdictions  in which KeySpan and each of its
Subsidiaries  pay income Tax are closed through the dates  enumerated in Section
3.1(n)  of the  KeySpan  Disclosure  Schedule.  Neither  KeySpan  nor any of its
Subsidiaries  is a party to, bound by or has any material  obligation  under any
Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreement,  arrangement or
understanding.  The income Tax Returns  delivered to Parent for  inspection  are
true and complete  copies.  All material written  communications  to or from any
federal, New York State or New York City taxing authority have been delivered to
Parent  for  inspection.  Neither  KeySpan  nor  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  has
constituted  either a "distributing  corporation" or a "controlled  corporation"
under  Section  355 of the Code (i) in the two  years  prior to the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution  which could otherwise  constitute part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e)
of the Code) in  conjunction  with the  Merger.  Neither  KeySpan nor any of its
Subsidiaries  has  participated  in a  "reportable  transaction"  as  defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 (as in effect at the relevant time) (or any
comparable  regulations of jurisdictions other than the United States).  Neither
KeySpan  nor  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  (A)  has  ever  been  a  member  of  a
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was KeySpan) or
(B)  has any  material  liability  arising  from  the  application  of  Treasury
Regulation  Section  1.1502-6  or any  analogous  provision  of state,  local or


                                       13
<PAGE>


foreign law, or as a transferee  or  successor,  by contract or  otherwise.  All
closing  agreements  with the Internal  Revenue  Service  have been  provided to
Parent  for  inspection.  For the  purpose  of this  Agreement,  the term  "Tax"
(including,  with  correlative  meaning,  the terms "Taxes" and "Taxable") shall
mean all Federal,  state, local and foreign income,  profits,  franchise,  gross
receipts,  payroll,  sales,  employment,  use,  property,  withholding,  excise,
occupancy  and other  Taxes,  duties or  assessments  of any nature  whatsoever,
together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such
amounts, and "Tax Return" shall mean any return,  report,  information return or
other document (including any related or supporting  information) required to be
filed with any taxing  authority  with respect to Taxes,  including  information
returns, claims for refunds of Taxes and any amendments or supplements to any of
the foregoing.

     (o) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each material  employee benefit plan
(including,  without  limitation,  any "employee  benefit  plan",  as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning
of ERISA  Section  3(37))  and all  stock  purchase,  stock  option,  severance,
employment,  change-in-control,  fringe benefit,  collective bargaining,  bonus,
incentive,  deferred  compensation  and other material  employee  benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements,  whether or not subject to
ERISA, (all the foregoing being herein called "Benefit Plans"),  under which any
employee, former employee,  consultant, former consultant or director of KeySpan
or any of its  Subsidiaries  has  any  present  or  future  right  to  benefits,
maintained or contributed to by KeySpan or by any trade or business,  whether or
not  incorporated  (an "ERISA  Affiliate"),  that together with KeySpan would be
deemed a "single  employer"  within the meaning of Section  4001(b) of ERISA, or
under  which  KeySpan  or any of its  Subsidiaries  has any  present  or  future
liability or potential liability (the "KeySpan Benefit Plans"), KeySpan has made
available,  or within 30 days after the execution hereof will make available, to
Parent a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent  annual report (Form 5500)
filed with the IRS,  (B) such KeySpan  Benefit  Plan,  (C) each trust  agreement
relating  to such  KeySpan  Benefit  Plan,  (D) the  most  recent  summary  plan
description for each KeySpan  Benefit Plan for which a summary plan  description
is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating
to a KeySpan  Benefit  Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (F) the most recent
determination  letter issued by the IRS with respect to any KeySpan Benefit Plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

     (ii) With respect to the KeySpan  Benefit  Plans,  individually  and in the
aggregate,  no event has  occurred  and  there  exists  no  condition  or set of
circumstances, in connection with which KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries could
be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse  Effect on KeySpan under ERISA,  the Code or any other  applicable  law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on KeySpan, (i) no liability under
Title IV or  section  302 of ERISA has been  incurred  by  KeySpan  or any ERISA
Affiliate  that has not been  satisfied in full,  and no  condition  exists that
presents  a risk to  KeySpan  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  of  incurring  any  such
liability,  other than liability for premiums due the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due), (ii) the PBGC has
not instituted proceedings to terminate any KeySpan Benefit Plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan") and no condition exists that presents a
risk that such  proceedings will be instituted and (iii) no Title IV Plan or any
trust established  thereunder has incurred any "accumulated  funding deficiency"
(as defined in Section 302 or ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not


                                       14
<PAGE>


waived,  as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan
ended prior to the Closing Date.

     (iii) Prior to the date of this Agreement,  KeySpan has delivered to Parent
a report that sets forth KeySpan's good faith  estimate,  as of the date of such
report, of (x) the amount to be paid under all KeySpan Benefit Plans (subject to
the exceptions described in such report and based upon the assumptions described
in such  report) to the current  officers  and key  employees of KeySpan and its
Subsidiaries who have contractual entitlements under any KeySpan Benefit Plan to
receive  "gross-up"  payments  for  golden  parachute  excise  taxes that may be
imposed  pursuant  to  Section  280G of the Code (or the  amount by which any of
their benefits may be accelerated or increased) as a result of (i) the execution
of this  Agreement,  (ii) the obtaining of  stockholder  approval of the Merger,
(iii) the  consummation  of the Merger or (iv) the  termination or  constructive
termination of the employment of such officers or key employees following one of
the  events  set  forth  in  clauses  (i)  through   (iii)  above  and  (y)  the
ramifications of such payments under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.

     (p) Labor Matters.  As of the date hereof,  neither  KeySpan nor any of its
Subsidiaries  is a party  to,  bound by or in the  process  of  negotiating  any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement with any union or labor
organization.  As of the  date of this  Agreement  (i)  there  are no  disputes,

representatives  of its employees,  (ii) there is no charge or complaint pending

lawsuits, claims, charges, complaints,  arbitrations, actions, investigations or
proceedings  pending  or, to the  Knowledge  of KeySpan,  threatened  between or
involving KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current
or former  employees,  independent  contractors,  applicants  for  employment or
classes  of the  foregoing,  except  in each  case as have not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on KeySpan and, (iv) to
the  Knowledge  of  KeySpan,  as of the  date of this  Agreement,  there  are no
material  organizational  efforts  presently  being  made  involving  any of the
employees  of  KeySpan  or  any of  its  Subsidiaries.  No  labor  union,  labor
organization  or group of  employees of KeySpan or any of its  Subsidiaries  has
made a  pending  demand  for  recognition  or  certification,  and  there are no

following meanings:  (x) "Environmental  Laws" shall mean all foreign,  federal,
state, or local statutes, regulations, ordinances, common law, codes, or decrees
and any binding  administrative or judicial  interpretation  thereof relating to
the  protection  of the  environment,  including  protection of the ambient air,

(collectively,  the "KeySpan Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on their
business substantially as currently conducted, except where such failures to own
or validly  license such KeySpan  Intellectual  Property would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect on KeySpan.  Neither KeySpan nor any
such Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and
there are no  infringements  of or  conflicts  with,  the rights of others  with
respect to the use of any KeySpan  Intellectual  Property  that,  in either such
case, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on KeySpan.

     (t) Insurance.  Except for failures to maintain insurance or self-insurance
that  have not had and could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Material
Adverse  Effect on  KeySpan,  from  January  1, 2003,  through  the date of this
Agreement,  each of KeySpan and its Subsidiaries has been  continuously  insured
with financially responsible insurers or has self-insured,  in each case in such
amounts and with respect to such risks and losses as are customary for companies
in the United  States  conducting  the  business  conducted  by KeySpan  and its
Subsidiaries   during  such  time  period.   Neither  KeySpan  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries has received any notice of cancellation or termination with respect

     601(b)(10) of Regulation  S-K of the SEC)  ("KeySpan  Material  Contracts")
     required to be have been filed with the SEC have been filed, so and no such

     force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
     subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
     other laws  relating to or  affecting  the rights and remedies of creditors
     generally  and to  general  principles  of equity  (regardless  of  whether
     considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),  except to the extent that
     (x) they have previously  expired in accordance with their terms or (y) the
     failure to be in full force and effect,  individually  or in the aggregate,
     would not reasonably be likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  Neither
     KeySpan nor any of its  Subsidiaries,  nor,  to  KeySpan's  Knowledge,  any
     counterparty to any KeySpan Material  Contract,  has violated any provision
     of, or  committed  or failed to  perform  any act  which,  with or  without
     notice,  lapse  of time or both,  would  constitute  a  default  under  the
     provisions of any KeySpan Material Contract,  except in each case for those
     violations or defaults which,  individually or in the aggregate,  would not
     reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (w) Foreign Corrupt Practices and International Trade Sanctions(i) . To the
Knowledge of KeySpan,  neither KeySpan, nor any of its Subsidiaries,  nor any of

be. The copies of the  certificate  of  incorporation  and  by-laws  (or similar
organizational  documents)  of  Parent  and  Merger  Sub which  were  previously
furnished to KeySpan are true,  complete and correct copies of such documents as
in effect on the date of this Agreement.

     of the Merger set forth in this  Agreement by the Required  Parent Vote (as

parties and  Governmental  Entities  necessary or advisable  to  consummate  the

conditions  of  this  Agreement,  complete  control  and  supervision  over  its

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     5.1.  Preparation of Proxy Statement and Circular;  Stockholders  Meetings.
(a) As promptly as  practicable  following the date hereof,  KeySpan  shall,  in
cooperation  with  Parent,  prepare  and  file  with the SEC  preliminary  proxy
materials (such proxy statement,  and any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Proxy Statement").  The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable  provisions of the Exchange Act.  KeySpan shall, as
promptly as  practicable  after receipt  thereof,  provide copies of any written
comments received from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement to Parent and
advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement  received
from the SEC.  KeySpan  agrees  that none of the  information  supplied or to be
supplied by KeySpan for  inclusion  or  incorporation  by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any  supplemental  proxy, at the time of mailing thereof and at the
time of the KeySpan Stockholders  Meeting, will contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or
necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under
which they were made, not misleading. Parent agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement or any supplemental proxy, at the time of mailing thereof
and at the time of the  KeySpan  Stockholders  Meeting,  will  contain an untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  required to be
stated  therein or necessary  to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading.  For purposes of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that information concerning or related to
KeySpan  and the  KeySpan  Stockholders  Meeting  will be  deemed  to have  been
supplied by KeySpan and  information  concerning  or related to Parent or Merger
Sub shall be deemed to have been supplied by Parent. KeySpan will provide Parent
with a reasonable  opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy  Statement and
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the
SEC, and will provide  Parent with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.
No amendment or supplement to the  information  supplied by Parent for inclusion
in the Proxy  Statement  shall be made  without the  approval  of Parent,  which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     (b) Parent shall,  in cooperation  with KeySpan,  prepare and file with the
UKLA  a  circular  to  shareholders  (such  circular,   and  any  amendments  or
supplements  thereto,  the "Circular").  The Circular shall comply as to form in
all material  respects with the  applicable  provisions of the UK Listing Rules.
Parent shall, as promptly as practicable  after receipt thereof,  provide copies
of any written  comments  received from the UKLA with respect to the Circular to


                                       27
<PAGE>


KeySpan and advise  KeySpan of any oral  comments  with  respect to the Circular
received from the UKLA.  Parent agrees that none of the information  supplied or
to be supplied by Parent for  inclusion  or  incorporation  by  reference in the
Circular or any  supplementary  circular,  at the time of mailing thereof and at
the time of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, will contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material  fact required to be stated  therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which  they  were  made,  not  misleading.  KeySpan  agrees  that  none  of  the
information supplied or to be supplied by KeySpan for inclusion or incorporation
by  reference  in the  Circular or any  supplementary  circular,  at the time of
mailing thereof and at the time of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, will contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of
the  circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading.  For purposes of
the  foregoing,  it is  understood  and agreed that  information  concerning  or
related  to Parent or Merger  Sub and the Parent  Shareholders  Meeting  will be
deemed to have been supplied by Parent and information  concerning or related to
KeySpan  shall be deemed to have been  supplied by KeySpan.  Parent will provide
KeySpan with a reasonable  opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Circular  prior to filing such with the UKLA, and will provide
KeySpan  with a copy of all such  filings  made with the UKLA.  No  amendment or
supplement to the information  supplied by KeySpan for inclusion in the Circular
shall be made  without  the  approval of KeySpan,  which  approval  shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     (c) KeySpan shall take all lawful action to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement,  and the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  by the
Required  KeySpan  Vote and the Board of Directors  of KeySpan  shall  recommend
adoption of this Agreement,  and the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  by the
stockholders  of KeySpan unless the Board of Directors of KeySpan  determines in
its reasonable good faith judgment,  after  consultation  with outside  counsel,
that taking any such action  would be  inconsistent  with its  fiduciary  duties
under applicable law. KeySpan shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this  Agreement,  duly  call,  give  notice of,  convene  and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "KeySpan Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose
of obtaining the Required  KeySpan Vote.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  KeySpan agrees that its obligations  pursuant to the second sentence
of this  Section  5.1(c) shall not be affected by (i) the  commencement,  public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to KeySpan of any Takeover Proposal
(as defined in Section 5.5), (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of
Directors of KeySpan of its approval or  recommendation  of this Agreement,  the
Merger  or the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  or (iii)  subject  to
KeySpan's right to terminate this Agreement  under Section 7.1(e),  the approval
or recommendation of any KeySpan Superior Proposal.  Notwithstanding  any of the
events set forth in clauses  (i),  (ii) and (iii) of the  immediately  preceding
sentence, in the event KeySpan fulfills its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.1(c) and the  KeySpan  Stockholder  Approval  is not  obtained  at the KeySpan
Stockholders  Meeting,  Parent shall not thereafter  have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), as a result of the Board of Directors
of KeySpan (or any committee thereof) having withdrawn or modified,  or proposed
publicly to withdraw or modify,  the approval or  recommendation  by the KeySpan
Board of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger, provided Parent shall retain
all other rights to terminate this Agreement set forth in Section 7.1.


                                       28

     (d) Parent shall recommend approval of this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated hereby, by the shareholders of Parent. Parent shall duly call, give
notice of,  convene and hold its general  meeting of  shareholders  (the "Parent
Shareholders  Meeting") at which  shareholders shall be asked to vote to approve
the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent agrees that
its obligations pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 5.1(d) shall not
be affected by (i) the  commencement,  public  proposal,  public  disclosure  or
communication  to Parent of any Parent  Acquisition  Transaction  (as defined in
Section 7.2) or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of
Parent of its approval or  recommendation  of this Agreement,  the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

     (e) KeySpan and Parent will use their  reasonable  best efforts to hold the
KeySpan  Stockholders  Meeting  and the Parent  Shareholders  Meeting as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may
hold the  Parent  Shareholder  Meeting  as part of its  Annual  General  Meeting
scheduled  for July 31,  2006;  provided,  further  that the Parent  Shareholder
Meeting shall in any event be held no later than August 31, 2006.

     5.2. Corporate Governance.  (a) The name of the Surviving Corporation shall
initially be KeySpan. The headquarters of the Surviving  Corporation shall be in
Brooklyn, New York.

     (b) At or  prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall  take all  actions
necessary to appoint two directors who  immediately  prior to the Effective Time
served as directors  of KeySpan to the Board of  Directors  of Parent.  One such
director  shall be the Person  specified on Exhibit A hereto and the second such
director shall be appointed  pursuant to the conditions and process set forth on
Exhibit A hereto.  Exhibit A hereto shall also set forth (i) as of the Effective
Time the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Surviving  Corporation,  (ii)
the manner in which certain senior  officers of the Surviving  Corporation as of
the  Effective  Time will be  selected  after the date  hereof  and prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) certain other matters.  All appointments  made pursuant
to this Section 5.2 and Exhibit A hereto shall be effective as of the  Effective
Time and shall comply with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
of the NYSE, the UKLA, the LSE and the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and all other applicable laws and regulations, in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time.

     (c) During the four-year period  immediately  following the Effective Time,
the Surviving  Corporation  shall provide,  directly or  indirectly,  charitable
contributions  and traditional  local community support within the service areas
of  KeySpan  and  each  of  its  Subsidiaries   that  are  utilities  at  levels
substantially   comparable  to  and  no  less  than  the  levels  of  charitable
contributions  and community  support provided by KeySpan and such  Subsidiaries
within their service areas within the four-year period  immediately prior to the
date of this  Agreement,  as set forth on Section 5.2 of the KeySpan  Disclosure
Schedule.  Without limitation to the foregoing,  the Surviving  Corporation will
for  such  period  continue  to  support  the  KeySpan  Foundation  in a  manner
substantially  comparable to the manner in which  KeySpan  supported the KeySpan
Foundation  within the four-year  period  immediately  prior to the date of this
Agreement, as set forth on Section 5.2 of the KeySpan Disclosure Schedule.

     5.3. Access to  Information.  Upon  reasonable  notice,  KeySpan shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel,  financial  advisors  and other  representatives  of Parent  reasonable


                                       29
<PAGE>


access during normal  business  hours,  during the period prior to the Effective
Time,  to  all  its  properties,  books,  contracts,   commitments  and  records
(including,  without  limitation,  any Tax  Returns)  and,  during such  period,
KeySpan shall (and shall cause its  Subsidiaries  to) furnish promptly to Parent
(a) a copy of each report,  schedule,  registration statement and other document
filed, published, announced or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements  of Federal or state  securities  laws, as  applicable  (other than
documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under  applicable  law),
and (b) consistent with its legal obligations,  all other information concerning
its  business,  properties  and  personnel  as Parent  may  reasonably  request;
provided  however,  that KeySpan may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that (i) a Governmental  Entity requires  KeySpan or any of its  Subsidiaries to
restrict access to any properties or information  reasonably related to any such
contract  on the  basis of  applicable  laws and  regulations  with  respect  to
national  security  matters,  (ii) any law,  treaty,  rule or  regulation of any
Governmental  Entity  applicable to KeySpan requires KeySpan or its Subsidiaries
to  restrict  access to any  properties  or  information,  (iii)  KeySpan or its
Subsidiaries is bound by a  confidentiality  agreement that requires  KeySpan or
its  Subsidiaries  to restrict  such  access or (iv) where such access  would be
reasonably likely to waive the attorney-client  privilege. The parties will hold
any such  information  which is non-public in confidence to the extent  required
by, and in  accordance  with,  the  provisions of the letter dated June 13, 2005
between KeySpan and Parent (the "Confidentiality  Agreement"). Any investigation
by KeySpan or Parent  shall not affect the  representations  and  warranties  of
KeySpan or Parent, as the case may be.

     5.4.  Reasonable  Best Efforts.  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement,  each party shall,  and shall cause its respective  Subsidiaries
to, use its reasonable  best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,  proper or advisable under
applicable  laws  and  regulations  to  consummate  the  Merger  and  the  other
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement as soon as  practicable  after the
date hereof.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,  each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate  filing (and to share equally in the filing
fees) of a Notification  and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions  contemplated hereby at a mutually agreed time and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable  waiting  periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

     (b) Each of  Parent  and  KeySpan  shall,  and shall  cause its  respective
Subsidiaries to, in connection with the efforts  referenced in Section 5.4(a) to
obtain  all  requisite   approvals  and   authorizations  for  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other  applicable law or
regulation,  use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make all appropriate filings
and submissions  with any Governmental  Entity that may be necessary,  proper or
advisable  under  applicable  laws  or  regulations  in  respect  of  any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection  with any such filing or  submission  and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private  party,  (iii)  promptly  inform  the other  party of any  communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the  Antitrust  Division
of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity and of
any material  communication  received or given in connection with any proceeding


                                       30
<PAGE>


by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions  contemplated
hereby and (iv) as  reasonably  practical,  permit the other party to review any
communication  given by it to,  and  consult  with each  other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person.

     (c) Each of  Parent  and  KeySpan  shall,  and shall  cause its  respective
Subsidiaries,  in connection with the efforts  referenced in Section 5.4 (a), to
obtain  all  requisite   approvals  and   authorizations  for  the  transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
KeySpan Required Approvals and the Parent Required Approvals; provided, however,
that Parent shall have primary  responsibility for the preparation and filing of
any  applications,  filings or other  materials with the FERC, the NYPSC and the
NHPUC. If Parent determines to make a filing with the  Massachusetts  Department
of  Telecommunications  and Energy in connection with the Merger,  KeySpan shall
cooperate with Parent in connection  with such filing.  KeySpan and Parent shall
cooperate in connection with seeking the consents set forth in Section 5.4(c) of
the KeySpan Disclosure Letter (the "Additional KeySpan Consents") subject to the
terms and conditions  set forth therein.  KeySpan shall have the right to review
and  approve in advance all  characterizations  of the  information  relating to
KeySpan  and the Merger  that  appear in any  application,  notice,  petition or
filing made in  connection  with the Merger.  KeySpan and Parent agree that they
will consult and cooperate  with each other with respect to the obtaining of the
KeySpan  Required  Approvals,  the Parent Required  Approvals and the Additional
KeySpan   Consents,   as  well  as  any  additional   necessary   approvals  and
authorizations of Governmental Authorities.

     (d) In  furtherance  and not in  limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections  5.4(a),  (b) and (c), if any objections are asserted with
respect to the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement or if any suit is
instituted (or threatened to be  instituted) by any  Governmental  Entity or any
private  party  challenging  any  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  as
violative of any Antitrust Law or other Law or otherwise  brought under any such
Law that would otherwise  prohibit or materially  impair or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and KeySpan shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections
or suits so as to permit  consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement,  including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any
case if not  resolved,  could  reasonably  be expected to prohibit or materially
impair  or delay  the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,
including selling,  holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting its
business in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits or agreeing to
sell, hold separate or otherwise  dispose of or conduct its business in a manner
which would resolve such  objections or suits or  permitting  the sale,  holding
separate  or other  disposition  of,  any of its  assets  or the  assets  of its
Subsidiaries  or the  conducting of its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or suits; provided, however, that no party shall be required to,
or may,  in the case of  KeySpan,  take any such  actions  to  resolve  any such
objections or suits which actions, individually or in the aggregate, (x) are not
conditional  on the  consummation  of the  Merger,  or (y) would have a Material
Adverse  Effect  on  National  Grid  USA or  KeySpan.  Without  excluding  other
possibilities,  the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed
to be  materially  delayed  if  unresolved  objections  or suits  delay or could
reasonably  be  expected  to  delay  the   consummation   of  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby  beyond the End Date (as  defined in Section  7.1(h)).  For
purposes  of this  Agreement,  "Antitrust  Law" shall mean the  Sherman  Act, as


                                       31
<PAGE>


amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,  Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004, the HSR
Act, the FTC Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and foreign statutes,
rules, regulations,  orders, decrees,  administrative and judicial doctrines and
other laws that are  designed  or  intended  to  prohibit,  restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of  monopolization or restraint of trade or
impeding or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition,  in any case
that are applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (e) Subject to the obligations  under Section 5.4(d), in the event that any
administrative  or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be  instituted)  by a  Governmental  Entity or  private  party  challenging  any
transaction  contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated
hereby each of Parent and KeySpan  shall  cooperate  in all  respects  with each
other and use its respective  reasonable  best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding.

     (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing  in this  Section  5.4 shall  limit a party's  right to  terminate  this
Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  7.1(h)  so long as such  party  has up to then
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.4.

     5.5. No Solicitation by KeySpan. (a) From the date hereof until the earlier
of the  Effective  Time or the date on which this  Agreement  is  terminated  in
accordance with the terms hereof,  KeySpan shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it or its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of
their respective officers, directors,  employees,  representatives or agents to,
directly  or  indirectly,  (i)  solicit,  initiate  or  knowingly  encourage  or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding,  or  the  making  of any  proposal  which  constitutes  or  that  may
reasonably  be expected to lead to, any Takeover  Proposal,  (ii) enter into any
letter of  intent or  agreement  related  to any  Takeover  Proposal  (each,  an
"Acquisition Agreement") or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that  constitutes,  or that may  reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal;  provided,  however,  that if, at any time after the date
hereof  and prior to the  KeySpan  Stockholders  Meeting,  KeySpan  receives  an
unsolicited  bona fide written  Takeover  Proposal from any third Person that in
the reasonable good faith judgment of KeySpan's Board of Directors  constitutes,
or is  reasonably  likely to result  in, a  Superior  Proposal  and the Board of
Directors of KeySpan  determines in its reasonable  good faith  judgment,  after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take any such action would be
inconsistent  with its fiduciary  duties under  applicable law,  KeySpan may, in
response to such  Superior  Proposal,  (x) furnish  information  with respect to
KeySpan to any such  Person  pursuant  to a  confidentiality  agreement  no more
favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent and (y)
participate in negotiations with such Person regarding such Superior Proposal if
(A)  prior to  furnishing  such  non-public  information  to, or  entering  into
discussions  or  negotiations  with,  such third  Person,  KeySpan or any of its
Subsidiaries  provides at least four  business  days advance  written  notice to
Parent of the identity of the third Person  making,  and the proposed  terms and
conditions  of,  such  Superior  Proposal  and a copy of all  written  materials
delivered  by such  third  Person to  KeySpan  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  (B)
KeySpan shall have provided to Parent a copy of all written materials  delivered
to the third  Person  making  the  Superior  Proposal  in  connection  with such
Superior  Proposal and made  available to Parent all materials  and  information


                                       32
<PAGE>


made  available to the third Person  making the Superior  Proposal in connection
with such Superior  Proposal and (C) KeySpan shall have fully complied with this
Section 5.5.  For  purposes of this  Agreement,  "Takeover  Proposal"  means any
inquiry,  proposal  or  offer  from  any  Person  (other  than  Parent  and  its
Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or
more of the assets of KeySpan and its  Subsidiaries or 20% or more of the voting
power  of the  capital  stock  of  KeySpan  or the  capital  stock of any of its
Significant  Subsidiaries then  outstanding,  any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person  beneficially  owning 20% or more
of the voting power of the capital stock of KeySpan or the capital stock of such
Subsidiaries  then   outstanding,   or  any  merger,   consolidation,   business
combination,  recapitalization,  liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving  KeySpan  or any of  its  Significant  Subsidiaries,  other  than  the
transactions  with Parent and Merger Sub  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  For
purposes of this Agreement,  a "Superior  Proposal"  means any unsolicited  bona
fide written offer made by any Person (other than Parent and its  Affiliates) to
acquire,  directly or indirectly,  for  consideration  consisting of cash and/or
securities,  more than 50% of the voting  power of the capital  stock of KeySpan
then outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of KeySpan and otherwise
on terms which the Board of Directors of KeySpan  determines  in its  reasonable
good faith judgment (after  consultation with its financial advisors) to be more
favorable  (taking into account (i) all financial and strategic  considerations,
including  relevant  legal,  financial,  regulatory  and other  aspects  of such
Takeover Proposal and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  deemed  relevant by the Board of Directors,  (ii) the identity of the
third party making such Takeover  Proposal,  (iii) the  conditions and prospects
for  completion  of such  Takeover  Proposal and (iv) all other factors that the
Board of  Directors of KeySpan are  permitted to consider  pursuant to ss.717 of
the NYBCL;  provided,  however, that no Takeover Proposal consisting of all cash
consideration  may be deemed a  Superior  Proposal  unless  the per  share  cash
consideration  proposed  pursuant to the  Takeover  Proposal is greater than the
Merger  Consideration  (as such  consideration  may be proposed to be changed by
Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) to KeySpan's  stockholders  than
the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement  (taking
into  account all of the terms of any  proposal by Parent to amend or modify the
terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

     (b) Except as set forth in Section  7.1(e),  neither the Board of Directors
of KeySpan nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend,  or propose
to approve or  recommend,  any  Takeover  Proposal or (ii)  authorize  or permit
KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Acquisition Agreement.

     (c) Nothing  contained  in this  Section 5.5 shall  prohibit  KeySpan  from
complying  with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2  promulgated  under the  Exchange  Act with
respect to a Takeover  Proposal;  provided,  however,  that compliance with such
rules  shall not in any way limit or modify  the effect  that any  action  taken
pursuant  to such  rules  has  under  any  other  provision  of this  Agreement,
including Section 7.1(d).

     (d) KeySpan agrees that it and its  Subsidiaries  shall,  and KeySpan shall
direct  and  cause its and its  Subsidiaries'  respective  officers,  directors,
employees,  representatives  and  agents to,  immediately  cease and cause to be
terminated any  activities,  discussions or  negotiations  with any Persons with
respect to any Takeover  Proposal.  KeySpan agrees that it will notify Parent in
writing as promptly as practicable  (and in any event within 24 hours) after any


                                       33
<PAGE>


Takeover  Proposal is received by, any  information  is requested  from,  or any
discussions  or  negotiations  relating to a Takeover  Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued  with,  KeySpan,  its  Subsidiaries,  or their  officers,
directors,  employees,  representatives or agents. The notice shall indicate the
name of the Person  making such  Takeover  Proposal or taking such  action,  the
material  terms and  conditions  of any  proposals  or offers  and a copy of all
written  materials  delivered  by such Person  making the  Takeover  Proposal to
KeySpan or any of its  Subsidiaries,  and  thereafter  KeySpan shall keep Parent
informed,  on a current  basis,  of the  status and  material  terms of any such
proposals  or offers  and the  status and  details  of any such  discussions  or
negotiations and provide Parent with copies of all written  materials  delivered
by  such  Person  making  the  Takeover  Proposal  to  KeySpan  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries   and  keep  Parent  informed  of  any  amendments  or  prospective
amendments  to such  information.  KeySpan  also  agrees  that it will  promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality  agreement in
connection  with any  Takeover  Proposal to return or destroy  all  confidential
information  heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of
its Subsidiaries. KeySpan shall provide Parent with reasonable advance notice of
any meeting of the KeySpan  Board of Directors to discuss or consider a Takeover
Proposal.

     5.6.  KeySpan  Stock  Options and Other  Stock  Awards;  Employee  Benefits
Matters.  (a) Options.  KeySpan  shall take all action  reasonably  necessary so
that,  immediately  prior to the Effective Time, each  outstanding  stock option
issued under the KeySpan Benefit Plans shall become vested and exercisable as of
the  Effective  Time and  shall be  canceled  and the  holder  thereof  shall be
entitled to receive at the Effective Time from KeySpan or as soon as practicable
thereafter  (but in no event later than 10 days after the  Effective  Time) from
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation in  consideration  for such stock option an
amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger  Consideration per
share over the exercise price per share previously subject to such stock option,
less any required  withholding taxes,  multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
KeySpan  Common  Stock  previously  subject  to such stock  option (a  "Canceled
Option").  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
or cause to be  delivered  to each  holder of  Canceled  Options an  appropriate
notice setting forth such holder's  rights to receive cash payments with respect
to  Cancelled  Options  pursuant to the KeySpan  Benefit  Plans and this Section
5.6(a).

     (b) Other KeySpan Stock Awards.  All shares of KeySpan Common Stock and any
other KeySpan stock unit awards (and any dividend  equivalent rights thereunder)
granted subject to vesting, deferral or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any
KeySpan Benefit Plan (collectively,  the "Other KeySpan Stock Awards") which are
outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free
of such  restrictions  as of the Effective  Time,  and shall be cancelled to the
extent  provided  by the  terms of such  KeySpan  Benefit  Plans  and the  award
agreements  governing such Other KeySpan Stock Awards at the Effective Time, and
each holder  thereof  shall be entitled to receive the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration,  multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of KeySpan  Common
stock subject to such Other KeySpan Stock Award,  less any required  withholding
taxes.

     (c) Employment Related Obligations; Employee Benefits.
         --------------------------------------------------

          (i)  Obligations of Parent;  Comparability  of Benefits.  Parent shall
     cause the Surviving  Corporation and each of its  Subsidiaries to honor all
     employment  related  obligations and agreements with respect to any current


                                       34
<PAGE>


     and former  employees,  directors and  consultants of KeySpan or any of its
     Subsidiaries   ("KeySpan  Employees")  (including  without  limitation  (A)
     recognizing  and, as required by Law,  bargaining  with,  or  continuing to
     recognize  and, as required by Law,  bargain  with,  the current  exclusive
     collective  bargaining  representatives  of the KeySpan  Employees  and (B)
     honoring,  or  continuing  to  honor,  all  current  collective  bargaining
     agreements.  As of the Effective Time, each KeySpan  Employee  covered by a
     collective  bargaining  agreement  listed on Section  3.1(p) of the KeySpan
     Disclosure  Schedule  shall remain  covered by such  collective  bargaining
     agreement.  In addition,  each KeySpan Benefit Plan shall be assumed by the
     Surviving  Corporation  at the  Effective  Time (and Parent shall cause the
     Surviving  Corporation  to make  all  required  payments  pursuant  to such
     KeySpan  Benefit Plans and any trusts  thereunder).  For at least two years
     thereafter,  Parent shall cause the Surviving  Corporation  and each of its
     Subsidiaries  to provide  each  KeySpan  Employee,  who is not covered by a
     collective  bargaining  agreement  listed on Section  3.1(p) of the KeySpan
     Disclosure Schedule, with a base salary or hourly wages, as applicable,  at
     least equal to that provided to such KeySpan Employee  immediately prior to
     the Effective Time, and to provide benefits to KeySpan  Employees,  who are
     not covered by a collective  bargaining  agreement listed on Section 3.1(p)
     of the KeySpan  Disclosure  Schedule,  that are no less  favorable than the
     benefits provided, in the aggregate, to KeySpan Employees immediately prior
     to the Effective Time;  provided,  however,  that for such two-year period,
     each  KeySpan  Employee  who  is not  covered  by a  collective  bargaining
     agreement listed on Section 3.1(p) of the KeySpan Disclosure Schedule shall
     be eligible to receive  severance  payments and benefits no less  favorable
     than those provided under the KeySpan  severance  plans and policies as set
     forth in Section 5.6(c) of the KeySpan Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding
     the  foregoing,  nothing  herein  shall  require  the  continuation  of any
     particular  KeySpan  Benefit Plan or prevent the  amendment or  termination
     thereof  (subject  to the  maintenance  of the  benefits as provided in the
     preceding sentence and subject to satisfaction of any legal duty to bargain
     with the collective  bargaining  representatives  of KeySpan Employees with
     respect to such matters).

          (ii)  Pre-Existing  Limitations;   Deductible;  Service  Credit.  With
     respect to any KeySpan Benefit Plans in which KeySpan Employees participate
     after the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall:  (A) to the extent  satisfied or
     inapplicable  under applicable  KeySpan Benefit Plans  immediately prior to
     the Effective Time,  waive all  limitations as to pre-existing  conditions,
     exclusions and waiting periods with respect to  participation  and coverage
     requirements  applicable to KeySpan Employees under any Parent Benefit Plan
     in which such employees may be eligible to participate  after the Effective
     Time, (B) provide each KeySpan Employee with credit for any co-payments and
     deductibles  paid prior to  participation  in such Parent  Benefit  Plan in
     satisfying any applicable  deductible or out-of-pocket  requirements  under
     any welfare  Parent Benefit Plan in which such employees may be eligible to
     participate  after the Effective Time, and (C) recognize all service except
     to the extent such  recognition  would  result in  duplication  of benefits
     (unless such duplication is expressly  contemplated in a plan, agreement or
     other  arrangement  of, or approved by,  Parent) of KeySpan  Employees with
     KeySpan and its current and former  affiliates for purposes (of eligibility
     to  participate,  vesting credit and  entitlement for benefits (but not for


                                       35
<PAGE>


     purposes of benefit  accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) in any
     Parent  Benefit Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate
     after the  Effective  Time,  to the same extent taken into account  under a
     comparable KeySpan Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     5.7.  Fees and  Expenses(a)  . Except as provided  in this  Section 5.7 and
Section 7.2, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,  this
Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the  party  incurring  such  fees or  expenses,  whether  or not the  Merger  is
consummated,  except that each of Parent and KeySpan shall bear and pay one-half
of the costs  and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with the  filings  of the
premerger  notification  and report  forms under the HSR Act  (including  filing
fees).

     5.8. Directors' and Officers'  Indemnification and Insurance. (a) After the
Effective  Time through the sixth  anniversary  of the  Effective  Time,  Parent
shall, or shall, cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each present (as of the Effective Time) or former officer,  director or employee
of KeySpan and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims,
losses,  liabilities,  damages,  judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses  (including  attorneys' fees and expenses)  incurred in connection with
any  claim,  action,  proceeding  or  investigation,  whether  civil,  criminal,
administrative  or  investigative,  arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or employee of KeySpan
or any of its  Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time  (including this Agreement and the  transactions  and actions
contemplated  hereby),  whether  asserted  or claimed  prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under  applicable law;  provided
that no  Indemnified  Party may settle any such claim without the prior approval
of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed).  Each
Indemnified  Party will be entitled to advancement  of expenses  incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, proceeding or investigation from Parent within ten
Business  Days of  receipt  by Parent  from the  Indemnified  Party of a request
therefor;  provided  that any person to whom  expenses are advanced  provides an
undertaking,  to the extent  required by the NYBCL, to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

     (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to maintain in effect (i)
in its certificate of incorporation  and by-laws for a period of six years after
the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors and  indemnification  of, and  advancement  of expenses to,  officers,
directors  and  employees  contained in the  certificate  of  incorporation  and
by-laws of KeySpan and (ii) at the election of Parent, for a period of six years
after the  Effective  Time,  (A)  maintain  in effect the  current  policies  of
directors' and officers'  liability  insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by KeySpan (provided that Parent may substitute  therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts  containing  terms and  conditions  which
are, in the  aggregate,  no less  advantageous  to the insured)  with respect to
claims  arising  from facts or events that  occurred on or before the  Effective
Time;  provided,  however,  that in no event shall the Surviving  Corporation be
required  to expend  in any one year an  amount in excess of 200% of the  annual
premiums currently paid by KeySpan for such insurance;  and, provided,  further,
that if the annual  premiums of such  insurance  coverage  exceed  such  amount,
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation  shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest  coverage  available  for a cost not  exceeding  such amount or (B)
provide tail coverage for such persons covered by current policies of directors'


                                       36
<PAGE>


and officers' liability  insurance and fiduciary liability insurance  maintained
by KeySpan which tail coverage shall provide  coverage for a period of six years
for acts prior to the Effective  Time on terms no less  favorable than the terms
of such current insurance coverage.

     (c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation  (whether arising before,  at or after the Effective
Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective  Time,  the  provisions  of this Section 5.8 shall  continue in
effect  until  the  final  disposition  of such  claim,  action,  proceeding  or
investigation.

     (d) In the event  that  Parent,  any of its  successors  or  assigns or the
Surviving  Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall  not  be the  continuing  or  surviving  corporation  or  entity  of  such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its  properties and assets to any Person,  then,  and in each such case,  proper
provision  shall be made so that the  successors  or  assigns  of  Parent or the
Surviving Corporation,  as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in Section 5.6 and this Section 5.8.

     5.9. Public Announcements.  KeySpan and Parent shall cooperate to develop a
joint  communications  plan and cooperate (i) to ensure that all press  releases
and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be  consistent  with  such  joint  communications  plan,  and (ii)  unless
otherwise  required by applicable law or by obligations  pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities  exchange,  to consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise  making any public  statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.10.   Conveyance  Taxes.  KeySpan  and  Parent  shall  cooperate  in  the
preparation,   execution   and  filing  of  all  Tax  Returns,   questionnaires,
applications or other documents  regarding any real property  transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer,
recording,  registration  and other  fees and any  similar  Taxes  which  become
payable in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement that
are required or permitted to be paid on or before the Effective Time.

     5.11.  Restructuring  of  Merger.  It may be  preferable  to  effectuate  a
business  combination  between  Parent and  KeySpan  by means of an  alternative
structure to the Merger. Accordingly, if prior to satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Article VI hereto,  Parent  proposes the adoption of an alternative
structure that otherwise  preserves for Parent and KeySpan the economic benefits
of the Merger and will not materially delay the consummation  thereof,  then the
parties shall use their respective  reasonable best efforts to effect a business
combination  among themselves by means of a mutually agreed upon structure other
than the Merger that so preserves such benefits;  provided,  however, that prior
to closing  any such  restructured  transaction,  all  material  third party and
Governmental   Authority   declarations,   filings,   registrations,    notices,
authorizations,  consents or approvals  necessary for the  effectuation  of such
alternative  business  combination  shall  have  been  obtained  and  all  other
conditions  to the  parties'  obligations  to  consummate  the  Merger and other
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  as  applied  to such  alternative  business
combination, shall have been satisfied or waived.

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     6.1.  Conditions  to Each  Party's  Obligation  to Effect the  Merger.  The
obligations  of KeySpan  and  Parent to effect  the  Merger  are  subject to the
satisfaction  or mutual  waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

     (a) Required KeySpan Vote. KeySpan shall have obtained the Required KeySpan
Vote for the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of KeySpan.

     (b) Required  Parent Vote.  Parent shall have obtained the Required  Parent
Vote for the approval of this Agreement.

     (c) No Injunctions or Restraints;  Illegality.  No federal, state, local or
foreign,  law, statute,  regulation,  code,  ordinance or decree shall have been
adopted or  promulgated,  and no temporary  restraining  order,  preliminary  or
permanent  injunction  or other  order  issued by a court or other  Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction (collectively "Restraints") shall be in effect,
having  the  effect  of making  the  Merger  illegal  or  otherwise  prohibiting
consummation of the Merger.

     (d)  Approvals.  The KeySpan  Required  Approvals  and the Parent  Required
Approvals  shall  have  been  obtained  (including,  in each  case  and  without
limitation,  the waiting  period (and any extension  thereof)  applicable to the
Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired) at or
prior to the Effective  Time,  such approvals shall have become Final Orders and
such Final Orders,  together with the  Additional  KeySpan  Consents,  shall not
individually  or in  the  aggregate,  impose  terms  or  conditions  that  would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect on National Grid
USA or KeySpan.  "Final Order" means action by the relevant  Governmental Entity
that has not been reversed,  stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended,
with  respect  to  which  any  waiting  period  prescribed  by  law  before  the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated has expired (but without the
requirement for expiration of any applicable rehearing or appeal period), and as
to which all conditions to the consummation of such  transactions  prescribed by
law, regulation or order have been satisfied. Any reference in this Agreement to
the  "obtaining"  of any such  approvals  shall mean making  such  declarations,
filings,  registrations,  giving such  notice,  obtaining  such  authorizations,
orders, consents, permits or approvals and having such waiting periods expire as
are, in each case, necessary to avoid a violation of law.

     6.2.  Additional  Conditions to  Obligations  of Parent and Merger Sub. The
obligations  of Parent and  Merger  Sub to effect the Merger are  subject to the
satisfaction  of, or waiver by Parent and Merger Sub, on or prior to the Closing
Date of the following additional conditions:

     (a) Representations  and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
KeySpan set forth  herein shall be true and correct both when made and as of the
Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent  expressly
made as of an earlier  date,  in which case as of such date),  except  where the
failure  of  such  representations  and  warranties  to be so true  and  correct


                                       38
<PAGE>


(without  giving  effect to any  limitation  as to  "materiality"  or  "material
adverse  effect" set forth  therein) does not have,  and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on

3.1(h)(i) shall be true in all respects  without  disregarding  the reference to
Material Adverse Effect therein.

complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants  required to
be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

no event has occurred which has had, and no fact or circumstance exists that has
resulted in or would  reasonably  be  expected to result in, a Material  Adverse
Effect on KeySpan.

     (d) Certificate.  Parent shall have received a certificate, dated as of the
closing date,  executed on behalf of KeySpan by the chief  executive  officer or
the chief  financial  officer of KeySpan,  to such  effect  that the  conditions
specified  in  paragraphs  (a),  (b) and  (c) of  this  Section  6.2  have  been
satisfied.

     6.3.  Additional  Conditions to Obligations of KeySpan.  The obligations of
KeySpan to effect the Merger are  subject to the  satisfaction  of, or waiver by
KeySpan, on or prior to the Closing Date of the following additional conditions:

     (a) Representations  and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth  herein shall be true and correct both when made
and at and as of the Closing  Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date),
except where the failure of such  representations  and  warranties to be so true
and correct  (without  giving effect to any  limitation as to  "materiality"  or
"material  adverse  effect"  set forth  therein)  does not  have,  and could not
reasonably be expected to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub.

     (b)  Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger
Sub  shall  have  performed  or  complied  in all  material  respects  with  all
agreements and covenants  required to be performed by it under this Agreement at

     7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective  Time,  whether  before  or after  the  Required  KeySpan  Vote or the
Required Parent Vote:

     (a) by mutual written consent of KeySpan and Parent;


                                       39
<PAGE>


     (b) by either KeySpan or Parent if any Restraint  having any of the effects
set forth in Section  6.1(c)  shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable;  provided  that the party  seeking to  terminate  this  Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall have fulfilled its obligations pursuant to
Section 5.4;

     (c) by Parent if there has been a breach of any  representation,  warranty,
covenant  or other  agreement  made by  KeySpan in this  Agreement,  or any such
representation  and  warranty  shall have become  untrue  after the date of this
Agreement,  in each case such that Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be
satisfied  and such breach or  condition  is not curable or, if curable,  is not
cured within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to KeySpan;

     (d) by Parent  if (i) the  Board of  Directors  of  KeySpan  shall not have
recommended,  or the Board of  Directors of KeySpan (or any  committee  thereof)
shall have  withdrawn or shall have  qualified or modified in any manner adverse
to  Parent  its  recommendation  of,  this  Agreement  or  its  approval  of  or
declaration that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to, and in
the best  interests  of,  KeySpan and its  stockholders  or shall have taken any
other  action  or made any  other  statement  in  connection  with  the  KeySpan
Stockholders  Meeting   inconsistent  with  such  recommendation,   approval  or
declaration,  (ii) the Board of Directors of KeySpan (or any committee  thereof)
shall have approved or  recommended  any Takeover  Proposal,  (iii) the Board of
Directors of KeySpan (or any committee  thereof) shall have proposed or resolved
to do any of the  foregoing  in clauses  (i) and (ii) or (iv) a tender  offer or
exchange  offer for 20% or more of the  outstanding  shares of capital  stock of
KeySpan is  commenced,  and the Board of Directors of KeySpan fails to recommend
against  acceptance of such tender offer or exchange  offer by its  stockholders
within 10 business days after such commencement (including by taking no position
with respect to the  acceptance  of such tender  offer or exchange  offer by its
stockholders);

     (e) by KeySpan prior to the KeySpan  Stockholders  Meeting if (A) the Board
of Directors of KeySpan authorizes KeySpan,  subject to complying with the terms
of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction
that constitutes a Superior  Proposal,  (B) Parent does not make, or cause to be
made, within four business days of receipt of KeySpan's written  notification of
its intention to enter into a definitive  agreement for a Superior Proposal,  an
offer that the Board of Directors of KeySpan determines,  in its reasonable good
faith judgment after  consultation with its financial  advisors,  is at least as
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of KeySpan as the
Superior  Proposal  and  (C)  KeySpan,   prior  to  or  concurrently  with  such
termination pays to Parent in immediately available funds the amount required by
Section  7.2(b).  KeySpan  agrees (x) that it will not enter  into a  definitive

Parent promptly in writing if its intention to enter into a definitive agreement
referred  to in its  notification  shall  change at any time after  giving  such
notification;

     (f) by KeySpan if there has been a breach of any representation,  warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this  Agreement,  or
any such  representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this  Agreement,  in each case such that Section  6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would


                                       40
<PAGE>


not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable,  is
not cured  within 30 days after  written  notice  thereof is given by KeySpan to
Parent;

     (g) by either KeySpan or Parent if (i) at the KeySpan  Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement  thereof),  the Required KeySpan Vote
shall  not  have  been  obtained,  or (ii) at the  Parent  Shareholders  Meeting
(including any  adjournment or postponement  thereof),  the Required Parent Vote
shall not have been obtained; or

     (h) by  either  Parent  or  KeySpan,  if the  Merger  shall  not have  been
consummated by the 15-month  anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "End
Date"); provided,  however, that if all other conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than  conditions  that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing
Date) are satisfied other than the condition to the Closing set forth in Section
6.1(d) which remains capable of being  fulfilled,  then either Parent or KeySpan
by written  notice  delivered  prior to the End Date,  may extend such period by
three months after the End Date; provided,  further, that the right to terminate
this  Agreement  under this  Section  7.1(h) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation  under this Agreement has been the cause
of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the End Date.

     7.2.  Effect  of  Termination.  (a) In the event of a  termination  of this
Agreement by either KeySpan or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or KeySpan or their respective officers or directors,
except with respect to Section 3.1(l), Section 3.2(g), Section 5.7, this Section
7.2 and Article VIII; provided,  however,  that nothing herein shall relieve any
party for liability for any willful or knowing breach hereof.

     (b) In the event of a termination of this  Agreement by Parent  pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or by KeySpan pursuant to Section 7.1(e),  then KeySpan shall, on
the date of such  termination,  pay to Parent,  by wire transfer of  immediately
available funds, the amount of $250,000,000 (the "Termination Fee").

     (c) In the event that between the date hereof and the  termination  of this
Agreement  any Person shall have directly or  indirectly  publicly  disclosed to
KeySpan and/or publicly disclosed or made known to KeySpan's  stockholders (x) a
Takeover  Proposal or (y) generally that if the Merger is not  consummated  such
Person or one of its Affiliates will make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, in
each case, this Agreement is terminated by Parent or KeySpan pursuant to Section
7.1(g)(i) or Section 7.1(h), and if concurrently with such termination or within
twelve months of such termination KeySpan or any of its Subsidiaries enters into
a definitive  agreement  with respect to a Takeover  Proposal or  consummates  a
Takeover  Proposal,  then  KeySpan  shall,  upon the  earlier  of  entry  into a
definitive  agreement with respect to a Takeover  Proposal or  consummation of a
Takeover  Proposal,  pay to Parent,  by wire transfer of  immediately  available
funds, the Termination Fee.

     (d) In the event that between the date hereof and the  termination  of this
Agreement (A) any Person shall have directly or indirectly publicly disclosed to
Parent and/or publicly  disclosed or made known to Parent's  shareholders  (x) a
proposal with respect to a Parent Acquisition  Transaction or (y) generally that
if the  Merger is not  consummated  such  Person or one of its  Affiliates  will


                                       41
<PAGE>


commence a Parent  Acquisition  Transaction and (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated  by  KeySpan  or  Parent  pursuant  to  Section  7.1(g)(ii),  and  if
concurrently with such termination or within twelve months of such termination a
Parent Acquisition Transaction occurs or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall
enter  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  respect  to  a  Parent  Acquisition
Transaction then Parent shall, upon the earlier of the date on which such Parent
Acquisition  Transaction  occurs  or the  date on  which  Parent  enters  into a
definitive  agreement with respect to a Parent Acquisition  Transaction,  pay to
KeySpan by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee. For the purposes of this Agreement (i) "Parent Termination Fee"
means the lesser of $250,000,000 or one percent of the market  capitalization of
Parent  on the date  such  payment  becomes  due and  payable  and (ii)  "Parent
Acquisition  Transaction"  means the  acquisition,  directly or indirectly,  for
consideration  consisting  of cash  and/or  securities,  of more than 50% of the
voting  power  of  the  capital  stock  of  Parent  then  outstanding  or all or
substantially all the assets of Parent.

     (e)  KeySpan  and  Parent  acknowledge  that the  agreements  contained  in
Sections   7.2(b)  through  (e)  are  an  integral  part  of  the   transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  and that,  without these agreements,  Parent or
KeySpan,  as applicable,  would not enter into this Agreement;  accordingly,  if
KeySpan or Parent, as applicable,  fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant
to Section 7.2(b),  (c) or (d), as the case may be, and, in order to obtain such
payment,  Parent or KeySpan, as applicable,  commences a suit which results in a
judgment  against KeySpan or Parent,  as applicable,  for any of the amounts set
forth in Section 7.2(b),  (c) or (d), as the case may be, KeySpan or Parent,  as
applicable,  shall  pay to  Parent  or  KeySpan,  as  applicable,  its costs and
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees) in connection  with such suit.  Interest
shall accrue on any amounts due under Section 7.2(b), (c), or (d) from and after
30 days of the date such  amount is due at the prime rate of  Citibank  N.A.  in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

     7.3.  Amendment.  This  Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time
before or after the Required KeySpan Vote or the Required Parent Vote; provided,
however,  that after any such  approval,  there shall not be made any  amendment
that  by law  requires  further  approval  by the  stockholders  of  KeySpan  or
shareholders of Parent without the further approval of such stockholders or such
shareholders.  This  Agreement  may not be amended  except by an  instrument  in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

     7.4.  Extension;  Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party
may (a) extend the time for the  performance of any of the  obligations or other
acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties  contained in this  Agreement or in any document
delivered  pursuant to this  Agreement  or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.3,  waive  compliance  by the  other  parties  with any of the  agreements  or
conditions contained in this Agreement.  Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such  extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an  instrument
in  writing  signed on behalf of such  party.  The  failure of any party to this
Agreement  to assert any of its rights under this  Agreement or otherwise  shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

     8.3.  Interpretation.  When a  reference  is  made  in  this  Agreement  to
Sections,  Exhibits or  Schedules,  such  reference  shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise  indicated.  The table of
contents and headings  contained in this  Agreement are for  reference  purposes
only and  shall not  affect in any way the  meaning  or  interpretation  of this
Agreement.  Whenever the words "include",  "includes" or "including" are used in
this  Agreement,  they  shall be deemed  to be  followed  by the words  "without
limitation".

     8.4.  Counterparts.   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  two  or  more
counterparts,  all of which shall be considered  one and the same  agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other  parties,  it being  understood  that the
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     8.5.  Entire  Agreement;  Third  Party  Beneficiaries.  (a) This  Agreement
constitutes  the  entire  agreement  and  supersedes  all prior  agreements  and
understandings,  both  written and oral,  among the parties  with respect to the
subject matter hereof,  other than the Confidentiality  Agreements,  which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

     (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party  hereto,  and  nothing in this  Agreement,  express  or  implied,  is
intended to or shall confer upon any other  Person any right,  benefit or remedy
of any  nature  whatsoever  under or by reason of this  Agreement,  other  than,
immediately  after the Effective Time,  Section 5.8 (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

     8.6.  Governing  Law.  THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED AND  CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     8.7. No Limitation on Other  Representation.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement,  nothing in any  representation  or warranty in this
Agreement shall in any way limit or restrict the scope, applicability or meaning
of any other  representation  or  warranty  made by  KeySpan  herein.  It is the
intention of the parties that, to the extent  possible,  unless  provisions  are
mutually  exclusive and effect  cannot be given to both or all such  provisions,
the  representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  closing  conditions  in this
Agreement  shall be construed  to be  cumulative  and that each  representation,
warranty,  covenant and closing  condition in this Agreement shall be given full
separate and independent effect.

     8.8.  Severability.  If any term or other  provision  of this  Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall  nevertheless  remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby is not  affected  in any manner  materially  adverse to any
party.  Upon such  determination  that any term or other  provision  is invalid,


                                       44
<PAGE>


illegal or incapable of being  enforced,  the parties hereto shall  negotiate in
good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect the original  intent of the
parties  as  closely  as  possible  in an  acceptable  manner in order  that the
transactions  contemplated hereby are consummated as originally  contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

     8.9. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations  hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto,  in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent  of the  other  parties,  and any  attempt  to make any such  assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding  sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon,  inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

     8.10.  Submission to Jurisdiction;  Waivers. Any suit, action or proceeding
against  any party  hereto  may be  brought  in any  federal  or state  court of
competent  jurisdiction  located in the Borough of Manhattan in the State of New
York, and each party hereto  irrevocably  consents to the jurisdiction and venue
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and in
the  courts  hearing  appeals   therefrom   unless  no  federal  subject  matter
jurisdiction  exists, in which event, each party hereto irrevocably  consents to
jurisdiction  and venue in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,  New York
County,  and in the courts hearing appeals  therefrom.  Each party hereto hereby
irrevocably  waives,  and agrees not to assert,  by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim  or  otherwise,  in any action or  proceeding  with respect to this
Agreement,  any claim that it is not personally  subject to the  jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance  with this Section 8.10,  that it or its property is exempt or immune
from  jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts  (whether  through  service  of  notice,  attachment  prior to  judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise),
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the suit,  action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper,  or that this Agreement,  or the
subject  matter hereof or thereof,  may not be enforced in or by such courts and
further  irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the  benefit  of any  defense  that  would  hinder,  fetter  or delay  the levy,
execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to
the final  judgment of any court having  jurisdiction.  Each party hereto agrees
that promptly following the date hereof (and in no event more than ten (10) days
following  the date  hereof) it shall  irrevocably  designate a New York Person,
such person,  upon such designation,  to be set forth (along with the address of
such U.S.  Person)  across from such  party's  name on Exhibit B hereto  (each a
"Process  Agent"),  as the  designees,  appointees  and  agents of such party to
receive, for and on such party's behalf, service of process in such jurisdiction
in any legal  action or  proceeding  with  respect  to this  Agreement  and such
service shall be deemed  complete upon  delivery  thereof to the Process  Agent;
provided  that in the case of any such service upon a Process  Agent,  the party
effecting  such  service  shall  also  deliver a copy  thereof  to the party who
designated  such Process Agent in the manner provided in Section 8.2. Each party
shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue said  appointment  in
full force and effect or to appoint  another  agent so that it will at all times
have an agent for  service of process for the above  purposes  in New York,  New
York. Each party further  irrevocably  consents to the service of process out of
any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing
of copies thereof by registered  airmail,  postage prepaid, to such party at its


                                       45
<PAGE>


address set forth in this  Agreement,  such  service of process to be  effective
upon  acknowledgement  of receipt of such registered mail.  Nothing herein shall
affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner  permitted by
law or to commence  legal  proceedings  or otherwise  proceed  against the other
party in any other jurisdiction in which the other party may be subject to suit.
Each party expressly  acknowledges  that the foregoing  waiver is intended to be
irrevocable  under the laws of the State of New York and of the United States of
America;  provided that each such party's  consent to  jurisdiction  and service
contained  in this  Section  8.10 is solely for the purpose  referred to in this
Section 8.10 and shall not be deemed to be a general  submission  to said courts
or in the State of New York other than for such purpose. This Agreement does not
involve less than  $250,000,  and the parties  intend that  ss.5-1401 of the New
York General Obligations Law shall apply to this Agreement.

     In the event of the transfer of all or substantially  all of the assets and
business of a Process Agent to any other corporation by  consolidation,  merger,
sale of  assets  or  otherwise,  such  other  corporation  shall be  substituted
hereunder  for such Process  Agent with the same effect as if  originally  named
herein in place of such party's Process Agent.

     8.11. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement  were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly  agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to specific  performance  of the terms  hereof,  this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

     8.12. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

     (a) "Board of  Directors"  means the Board of  Directors  of any  specified
Person and any committees thereof.

reasonably be expected to be,  material and adverse to the financial  condition,
business, assets,  liabilities (contingent or otherwise),  operations or results
of operations of such entity and any of its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or
(b) prevents or has a material and adverse  effect on the ability of such entity
to perform its material  obligations  under this  Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby by the End Date; provided, however, that to the
extent any event, effect, change or development is caused by or results from any
of the  following,  in  each  case,  it  shall  not be  taken  into  account  in
determining  whether  there has been (or would  reasonably  be expected to be) a
"Material Adverse Effect": (i) factors affecting the economy,  financial markets


                                       46

industry,  (ii) factors affecting the utility industry as a whole, except to the

comparable  participants  in the utility  industry,  (v) any change in generally
accepted accounting  principles by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
SEC or any other  regulatory body unless such change results in a cash impact on
such party or (vi) any matter to the extent  identified  in Section  8.12 of the
KeySpan Disclosure  Schedule or Section 8.12 of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule.
For the  avoidance  of doubt,  it is  expressly  agreed  that (a) the failure to
obtain  any  consent  pursuant  to the  terms of  items 9, 10 and 11 on  Section
3.1(d)(ii)  of  the  KeySpan   Disclosure   Schedule  or  necessary  to  prevent

and 11 on Section  3.1(d)(ii) of the KeySpan Disclosure  Schedule,  the costs of
obtaining  any such  consent and the impact of any  agreements  entered  into in

reasonably expected to occur and (b) with respect to regulatory approvals sought

such partnership),  (ii) of which at least a majority of the securities or other
interests which have by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the Board of Directors or others  performing  similar  functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization are owned by such party or one or more of
