 1.3 _Effective Time_  

   

 (a) On the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall duly execute and file articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") in accordance the MGCL and the MLLCA. The Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") upon such time as the Articles of Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT, or such later time which the parties shall have agreed upon and designated in such filing in accordance with the MGCL as the effective time of the Merger. 

   

 (b) Unless otherwise agreed, the parties hereto shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date. 

   

 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur on the fifth (5th) Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but subject to satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same (unless extended by the mutual agreement of the parties hereto) or on such other day as the parties hereto may mutually agree, and, subject to the foregoing, shall take place at such time and on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "); provided, however, in no event shall the Closing Date occur earlier than January 8, 2007.

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 2 

   

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER 
 ON THE SHARES OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES 

   

 2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Shares or any interests in Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _ Stock of Merger Sub_. Each limited liability company interest in Merger Sub existing immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) _ Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share (other than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to Ten Dollars and Seventy-Five Cents ($10.75) (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to Section 2.5 and Section 5.1(a). 

   

 (c) _ Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash, Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (d) _ Cancellation of Shares_. All Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect to such interest, except, in all cases (other than with respect to Excluded Shares), the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (e) _ Restricted Shares_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that all unvested restricted share awards (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted under any director or employee equity compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (the " _Company Equity Compensation Plan_ ") shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements. At such time, all such Company Restricted Shares shall become Company Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, and holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_  

   

 (a) _ Paying Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the cash payment in accordance with this Article II of the Merger Consideration (such cash being referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). On the Closing Date, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to deposit with the Paying Agent the Payment Fund for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of 

    ##### 

  

 

Merger. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all
interest earned on cash deposited in the Payment Fund shall be paid to the
Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) _ Share Transfer Books_. On the Closing Date, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Shares. From and after the Closing Date, (i) the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of the Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and (ii) holders of grants evidencing ownership of Company Restricted Shares (each, a " _Grant_ "), which shares shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(e), shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Closing Date, any Certificates or Grants presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or the transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby. 

   

 (c) _ Payment Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in any event within three (3) Business Days), the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Grant(s) that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Company Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive or be exchanged for Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Grants shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Grants to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Grants in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Grant for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Grant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Grant pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate or Grant so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the share transfer book of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Grant so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or Grant shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Grant shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Grant. 

   

 (d) _ No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares. _On the Closing Date, holders of Company Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of 

    ##### 

 

  

the Company other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration provided
under this Article II. The Merger Consideration paid or delivered upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Grants evidencing Company Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Company Shares exchanged therefor. 

   

 (e) _ Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to the Surviving Company and any holders of Company Shares prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _ No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately prior to the time any portion of the Payment Fund would escheat or similarly be deemed property of any Governmental Entity, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such portion of the Payment Fund shall be delivered to Parent and thereafter the holders of Company Shares with respect to such portion of the Payment Fund shall look only to the Surviving Company and only as a general creditor thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (g) _ Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund, as directed by the Surviving Company, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

 3.13 _Tax Matters._  

  

 (a) All material federal and other material Tax Returns (as hereinafter defined) required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries have been filed with the appropriate taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (after giving effect to any valid extensions of time in which to make such filings), and all such Tax Returns, as amended, were accurate and complete in all material respects. Except as and to the extent publicly disclosed by the Company in the Company Filed SEC Reports, (i) all material Taxes payable by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (whether or not shown in a Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid, and (ii) adequate reserves or accruals (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax items) for Taxes have been provided in accordance with GAAP on the most recent financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Reports with respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which Taxes are not yet due and owing or for which Taxes are being contested in good faith.

a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a
corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Each Company

 (k) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in any reportable or listed transactions as defined under Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder or in any transaction of which it has made disclosure to any taxing authority to avoid the imposition of penalties.

 (o) The Company has the right to make or to require, and, after the Effective Time will continue to have the right to make or to require, each entity in which it or any Company Subsidiary owns an equity interest and that is subject to federal income tax as a partnership to make an election under Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding elections 

    ##### 

  

 

under state or local tax Law) to adjust the basis of its property as provided
in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

In the event that the Company Board makes such determination, the Company may enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, but not prior to three (3) Business Days after the Company (A) has provided Parent with written notice that the Company has elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and otherwise complied with the Companys obligations under Section 8.1(e) and in the preceding sentence, and (B) has set forth such other information required to be included therein as provided in Section 8.1(e). 

   

 (c) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall cease immediately, and cause to be terminated, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, a director, officer, employee, trustee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was an officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in 

    ##### 

  

 

connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or

to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against
and respond thereto. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in respect of any Pre-Closing Matters and, at the Closing Date, shall become the obligation of the Surviving Company;  _provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and trustees of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company and/or one of the Companys Subsidiaries and the officers and trustees listed in Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a non-cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors, officers and trustees in the same form as presently maintained by the Company, with the same or comparably rated insurers as the Companys current insurer, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage in respect of any Pre-Closing Matters for six (6) years following the Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, the obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.5 applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee. This Section 6.5 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and shall be binding on all successors of the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.5. 

   

 (e) In the event that, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and 

    ##### 

  

 

assigns of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.5. 

   

 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each of the Companys and each Company Subsidiarys directors, officers, employees and agents to, afford to Parent and to the directors, officers, employees, and agents of Parent reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours without undue interruption (and will request the same from the Companys auditors, attorneys, financial advisors and lenders) to the properties, books, records and contracts of the Company and each Company Subsidiary; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to a schedule of properties to be visited prior to any such visits or access. Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to contacting or meeting with any of the Companys employees. The Company shall furnish Parent such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in that certain confidentiality agreement between Parent and the Company dated August 2, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

   

 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties hereto shall make a joint public announcement of the Merger contemplated hereby no later than the opening of trading on the NYSE on the Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is fully executed. 

  

 6.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) After the Closing Date, all employees of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") who are employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, including the Surviving Company, shall continue to be eligible to participate in any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an " _Employee Benefit Plan_ "), of the Company which is continued by Parent, or alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries in a similar Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or in which employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate after the Closing Date. With respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan of Parent, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of 

    ##### 

  

 

them shall be included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting (if applicable) and determination of the level of entitlement to
benefits under such Employee Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Company
Employees under any comparable welfare plan that such Company Employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
comparable welfare plan maintained by the Company for such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such Company
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date for the plan year within which the Closing Date occurs in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date. 

   

 (b) At and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or its Affiliates to honor fully, in accordance with their respective terms, all employment agreements, severance agreements, and retention bonus agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, all of which are listed in Section 6.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and such arrangements shall continue to be obligations of the Surviving Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable (subject however to such modifications as are agreed to in connection with the satisfaction of Section 7.2(e)). The parties hereto acknowledge that as of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall employ each individual who was employed by the Company or such Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing Date on terms that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the terms applicable to such individuals employment with the Company or such Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing Date. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or its Affiliates to provide compensation and employee benefits to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, for so long as they are employed, on terms that are substantially comparable or more favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to such employees by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date (subject to the limitations contained in Section 7.2(e)), which are described in Section 6.8(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 6.8 shall not inure to the benefit of the persons entitled to the benefits, or party to the agreements, described herein, as third party beneficiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment or resumed employment. 

   

 6.9 _Certain Tax Matters_. __  

  

 (a) At Parents election, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all necessary action to cause any or all of the Company Subsidiaries that are treated as "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code to be converted into limited liability companies, effective immediately prior to the Closing, that are (i) disregarded for United States federal income tax purposes and (ii) not treated as "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the 

    ##### 

  

 

meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (the " _Conversion_ "), _provided_
that (x) the out-of-pocket costs of effecting the Conversion shall be borne
by Parent and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall pay or
incur any out-of-pocket costs in connection with the Conversion without the
prior written approval of Parent, and (y) all such actions shall be (1)
in compliance with the mortgages relating to the Company Properties owned by
any Company Subsidiary that are so converted, unless such mortgages will be
repaid or defeased in connection with or immediately following the Closing,
and (2) not in violation of the applicable organizational documents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company shall cooperate with Parent
and Merger Sub to effect the Conversion, including by executing the
appropriate documents relating to the Conversion and filing documents with
the applicable secretaries of state or similar agencies. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent written evidence of such filings. 

   

 (b) For federal and applicable state income tax purposes, the Company shall treat the Merger as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to Merger Sub in exchange for the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Company Shares and the assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by the Companys liquidating distribution of the Merger Consideration to its stockholders under Section 331 of the Code and Section 562 of the Code. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for federal income tax purposes and the Company Board, prior to that date on which the Effective Time occurs, will adopt this Agreement as such plan. 

   

 6.10 _Interim Period Dividends_. At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall declare a quarterly prorated cash dividend covering the period from the first date of the quarter in which the Closing occurs up to and including the Closing Date at a rate not to exceed the rate per Company Share set forth in Section 5.1. 

  

 6.11 _Standstill, Ownership_. __  

  

 (a) During the period from the date of the Agreement through the Effective Time, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party and which relates to the confidentiality of information regarding Company or any Company Subsidiary or which relates to the securities of the Company. 

   

 (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates, including Merger Sub, shall, prior to the Effective Time, acquire any Company Shares or other securities of the Company, or take any other action, to the extent that they, taken together as a group, would beneficially (as defined in the Company Charter) own or be deemed to beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of the lesser of the aggregate number or aggregate value of the outstanding Company Shares, or that would cause Parent or any of its Affiliates, including Merger Sub, to become an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for purposes of the Maryland Business Combination Act (as defined in the MGCL). 

   

 6.12 _Resignation of Company s Officers and Directors_. If so requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing Date, the resignation, in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Parent, of each officer and director of the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.13 _Cooperation_. The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing by Merger Sub (or any Affiliate thereof) relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by Parent from time to time (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may be). 

  

 6.14 _Denver Property; Mortgagee Consents_  

  

 (a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, with respect to the Denver Property Acquisition, without the prior written approval of Merger Sub (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), waive any material term or condition to closing under the Denver Agreement, amend or terminate in any material respect the Denver Agreement or any other agreement relating to the Denver Property Acquisition, or grant any consent or approval under or with respect to the Denver Agreement or relating to the Denver Property Acquisition which is likely to be material to the Denver Property. Merger Sub shall respond to any request by the Company for a material waiver, amendment, termination, consent or approval contemplated by this Section 6.14(a) within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such request from the Company. Failure to respond within such two (2) Business Days shall constitute the approval of Merger Sub. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly take all action required by any mortgage documentation relating to any Company Property encumbered by a mortgage or as may commercially reasonably be requested (determined in the context of the applicable mortgage loan) by a mortgagee, and the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall cooperate in all such actions, in order to obtain the consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of each mortgagee of any Company Property encumbered by a mortgage, unless the applicable mortgage loan is identified in writing by Parent as being a mortgage loan that will be defeased or repaid in connection with or immediately following the Closing. Parent shall bear all out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the administration and processing of such consents and any other amounts to the extent required to be paid under the applicable mortgage documentation in connection with obtaining such consents. 

   

 (c) In the event that the acquisition of the Denver Property (the " _Denver Property Acquisition_ ") pursuant to the Denver Agreement has not closed prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent, each in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and dated no more than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) an estoppel certificate from the Denver Seller to Parent confirming that there are no existing defaults or other events or circumstances under the Denver Agreement that are reasonably likely to result in a termination of the Denver Agreement prior to consummation of the Denver Property Acquisition, and (ii) a certificate from an independent licensed engineer reasonably acceptable to Parent specifying the percentage of completion of the Denver Property as of such date, and confirming that, in such engineers good faith professional judgment, the estimated completion date of the Denver Property will be on or before the last day permitted for the closing of the Denver Property Acquisition under the Denver Agreement and on or before the required occupancy date under the Denver Lease. In the event that the Company does not deliver to Parent the estoppel certificate referred to in clause (i) above, the Company may retain a nationally recognized independent 

    ##### 

  

 

outside law firm experienced in real estate transactions to render an opinion
to Parent to the effect that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in breach or default of its obligations under the Denver Agreement (the "
_No Default Opinion_ "). The No Default Opinion shall be deemed to satisfy
the obligation to deliver the estoppel certificate referred to in clause (i)
above unless Parent or Merger Sub has received other reasonable evidence that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in breach or default of its
obligations under the Denver Agreement that is reasonably likely to result in
a termination of the Denver Agreement.

 (d) by written notice from the Company to Parent, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and such condition is reasonably likely to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; 

   

 (e) by written notice from the Company to Parent, in connection with entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.4; _provided, however_ , that prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the Company shall have provided Parent with at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of the Companys decision to so terminate.

If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(i) or (b)(iii) and (x) any Person shall have publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the stockholders of Company contemplated by this Agreement (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)) or the termination date (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)), and (y) within nine (9) months after such termination Company enters into an agreement with such Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date Company enters into such agreement. 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), Merger Sub shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to the Company as set forth in Section 4.6(a)(ii) within three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination. The amount of the Deposit delivered to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) shall be counted towards, and reduce, any amounts for which Parent or any Affiliate thereof shall otherwise be liable to the Company or any Affiliate thereof arising from this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f), in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the payment of the Break-Up Fee shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which Parent or Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any 

    ##### 

  

 

Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or
stockholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge
and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual
damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f), in circumstances where the
Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the rights
to payment under Section 8.2(b): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the
damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f),
and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages
arising as a result of the foregoing. Except for nonpayment of the amounts set
forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.3, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, upon
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section
8.1(f), in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with
Section 8.2(b), or upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub, (i) seek
to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective trustees, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or
stockholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect or punitive damages. In case this
Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to any section other than Sections
8.1(e) or 8.1(f) or otherwise breached, the Parties shall retain all rights
and remedies at law and equity. 

   

 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Sections 8.3(b), 8.3(c) and 8.2, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all fees, costs and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses, except for the filing fees and expenses related to the Proxy Statement, CFIUS or other antitrust statute or regulation and fees and expenses related to obtaining the consents described in Section 6.14(b) (collectively, " _Shared Costs_ "), which shall be subject to reimbursement as follows: (x) the Company shall reimburse Parent for 100% of the out-of-pocket Shared Costs paid by Parent or Merger Sub in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 8.1(c), (y) Parent shall reimburse the Company for 100% of the out-of-pocket Shared Costs paid by the Company (or any Company Subsidiary) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (z) each party shall reimburse the other party such that 50% of the Shared Costs are borne by Parent or Merger Sub and 50% of the Shared Costs are borne by the Company in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(b). 

   

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or by Parent because the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained, the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination, all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, lenders, accountants, financial advisors, and investment bankers, incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts

contemplated hereunder, _provided_ that the amount of such fees and expenses

The payment of expenses set forth herein is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity). 

   

 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time before or after any approval hereof by holders of the Company Shares; _provided, however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such approval.

At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be enforced. Except as so waived, no action taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

 9.4 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise and the word "including" and words of similar import shall mean "including without limitation." The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question or intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 9.5 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. Except for Articles I and II, Sections 6.5, 6.8, and 9.6(b), (a) none of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and (b) thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective officers, trustees, directors or stockholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any party hereto, express or implied. 

  

 9.6 _Performance by Merger Sub; Limitation of Liability._  

   

 (a) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform, discharge and comply with, all of the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. 

   

 (b) RFMLs liability to any party in connection with this Agreement is limited in aggregate to the extent RFML actually receives money under or pursuant to its right to be indemnified for that liability out of the assets of Parent under Parents constitution or applicable 

    ##### 

  

 

Law. Each party waives and releases RFML from any liability in relation to any
default or breach by RFML under this Agreement that is greater than as
described in the foregoing sentence. 

   

 9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent when due, and Parent shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation. 

  

 9.8 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement (a) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person (except as set forth below) any rights or remedies hereunder and (c) may be executed in two or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the federal and state courts located in Maryland, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.9 _Assignment; Benefit_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (except for Section 6.5, which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein), nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 9.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. 

  

 9.11 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction._  

   

 (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and 

    ##### 

  

 

exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland (" _Maryland
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead
or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland. 

   

 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties hereto. Facsimile transmission of any signed original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an original.

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 You have requested our opinion in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October ___, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Record Realty Trust, a listed Australian Property Trust acting through its responsible entity, Record Funds Management Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia, Record Realty (US) LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, and Governmental Properties Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), regarding the status of the Company as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. All capitalized terms used in this opinion letter but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 In connection with the opinions expressed herein, we have reviewed the Proxy Statement which was distributed to shareholders of the Company in connection with their approval of the Merger Agreement (the "Proxy Statement"). 

   

 The opinions expressed herein are based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), Treasury regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury regulations) and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, legislative history and administrative determinations of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") (including its practices and polices in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS, except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof. This opinion represents our best legal judgment with respect to the probable outcome on the merits and is not binding on the IRS or the courts. There can be no assurance that positions contrary to our opinion will not be taken by the IRS, or that a court considering the issues would not reach a conclusion contrary to such opinions. No assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or administrative changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would not adversely affect the opinions expressed herein. 

   

 In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have examined such statutes, regulations, records, certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinions, including: (i) the Proxy Statement; (ii) the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; and (iii) the Merger Agreement. 

   

 In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon written representations as to factual matters of Company contained in a letter to us dated _ _, 

    ##### 

  

    

2007 regarding their consolidated assets, operations and activities (the
"Management Representation Letter"). We have not made an independent
investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the Management
Representation Letter or in any other document. We consequently have relied
upon the accuracy of the representations as to factual matters in the
Management Representation Letter. After inquiry, we are not aware of any
facts or circumstances contrary to, or inconsistent with, the representations
that we have relied upon or the other assumptions set forth herein. Our
opinion is limited to the tax matters specifically covered herein, and we
have not addressed, nor have we been asked to address, any other tax matters
relevant to Company or any other person. 

   

 We have assumed, with your consent, that, insofar as relevant to the opinions expressed herein: 

   

 (1) the Company has been and will be operated in the manner described in the Management Representation Letter and the Proxy Statement; 

   

 (2) all of the obligations imposed by the documents that we reviewed have been and will continue to be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms; and all of such documents have been properly executed, are valid originals or authentic copies of valid originals, and all signatures thereon are genuine; and 

   

 (3) all representations made in the Management Representation Letter (and other factual information provided to us) are true, correct and complete and will continue to be true, correct and complete, and any representation or statement made in the Management Representation Letter "to the best of knowledge," or "to the actual knowledge" of any person(s) or party(ies) or similarly qualified is true, correct and complete as if made without such qualification. 

   

 Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the discussion below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2003, the Company has, since the effective date of its REIT election and through and including the taxable year of the Company ending on the Closing Date, been organized and operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. 

   

 We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in our opinion subsequent to the date of this letter. The Companys qualification for taxation as a REIT depends upon the Companys ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating and other results, certain requirements of the Code, including requirements with regard to the sources of its gross income, the composition of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership. We will not review the Companys compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Companys operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 

   

 We express no opinion other than that specifically set forth above and our opinion is limited to the tax issues addressed therein. Additional issues may exist that could affect the   ##### 

  

  

  

tax treatment of the transactions referenced in the opinion, and the opinion
does not consider or provide a conclusion with respect to any additional
rules. 

   

 This opinion, which speaks as of the date hereof, has been prepared solely for your use pursuant to Section 7.2(b) of the Merger Agreement and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. 

   

 The tax advice set forth in this letter was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties that may be imposed with respect to any tax issues. The tax advice set forth in this letter was written to support the promotion or marketing of the matters addressed herein. Each recipient of this letter with whom we do not have an attorney-client relationship should seek advice based on that persons particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor. 

    

Very truly yours, 

    #####
