and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The term &#147;<U>Company Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means a material

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have requested our opinion in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2006 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) by and among
Record Realty Trust, a listed Australian Property Trust acting through its responsible entity,
Record Funds Management Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Australia, Record Realty (US)&nbsp;LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, and Governmental
Properties Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), regarding the status of the Company
as a real estate investment trust (a &#147;REIT&#148;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. All capitalized
terms used in this opinion letter but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the
Merger Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the opinions expressed herein, we have reviewed the Proxy Statement which
was distributed to shareholders of the Company in connection with their approval of the Merger
Agreement (the &#147;Proxy Statement&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinions expressed herein are based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;),
Treasury regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury regulations) and
interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, legislative history and
administrative determinations of the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) (including its practices
and polices in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS, except with
respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling), all as of the date hereof. This opinion
represents our best legal judgment with respect to the probable outcome on the merits and is not
binding on the IRS or the courts. There can be no assurance that positions contrary to our opinion
will not be taken by the IRS, or that a court considering the issues would not reach a conclusion
contrary to such opinions. No assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or
administrative changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would not adversely affect
the opinions expressed herein.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have examined such statutes, regulations,
records, certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis
for such opinions, including: (i)&nbsp;the Proxy Statement; (ii)&nbsp;the Amended Articles of Incorporation
of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; and (iii)&nbsp;the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon written representations as to
factual matters of Company contained in a letter to us dated <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>,

relied upon the accuracy of the representations as to factual matters in the Management
Representation Letter. After inquiry, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances contrary to,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the discussion below, we are of the opinion that,
commencing with its taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company has, since the effective date
of its REIT election and through and including the taxable year of the Company ending on the
Closing Date, been organized and operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under
the Code.

this letter. The Company&#146;s qualification for taxation as a REIT depends upon the Company&#146;s ability
to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating and other results, certain
requirements of the Code, including requirements with regard to the sources of its gross income,
the composition of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of
its share ownership. We will not review the Company&#146;s compliance with these requirements on a
continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company&#146;s
operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to
shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the
requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We express no opinion other than that specifically set forth above and our opinion is limited
