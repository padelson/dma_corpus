 SECTION 2.03 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) Within 75 days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Members Representative written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), including detailed supporting calculations of (i) the Indebtedness of the Company less Members Subordinated Debt as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the Members Equity of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Members  Equity_"), (iii) the Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_ ") and (iv) Parents calculation of the amount of any Initial Merger Consideration adjustment required pursuant to Section 2.03(i) (" _Adjustment Amount_ "), if any. If Parent represents that no Adjustment Amount is due and required, the Adjustment Notice shall so state. The Closing Balance Sheet, including the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity and Closing Working Capital, will be prepared in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the methods and practices used to prepare the Estimated Balance Sheet, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Working Capital, and Estimated Members Equity. 

   

 (b) Within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the Members Representative will deliver to Parent a written response in which the Members Representative will either: 

   

 (i) agree in writing with the Closing Balance Sheet as set forth in the Adjustment Notice, in which case such calculations of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and Adjustment Amount, if any, will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.03(i); or 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) dispute Parents calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital or Adjustment Amount, if any, as set forth in the Adjustment Notice by delivering to Parent a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed in good faith. 

  

 (c) If the Members Representative fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Company will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted Parents calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and/or Adjustment Amount, if any, as set forth in the Adjustment Notice, in which case such calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and Adjustment Amount will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.03(i). 

   

 (d) If the Members Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then Parent and the Members Representative will attempt in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to agree on the calculations of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and Adjustment Amount for purposes of Section 2.03(i). Any resolution by Parent and the Members Representative during such 30-day period as to any disputed items will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.03(i). If Parent and the Members Representative do not resolve all disputed items by the end of 30 days after the date of delivery of the Dispute Notice, then Parent and the Members Representative will submit the remaining items in dispute to Hein and Associates, LLP, or if that firm is unwilling or unable to serve, Parent and the Members Representative will engage another mutually agreeable independent accounting firm of recognized national standing, which is not the regular auditing firm of Parent or the Company. If Parent and the Members Representative are unable to jointly select such independent accounting firm within 10 days after such 30-day period, Parent and the Members Representative will each select an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing and each such selected accounting firm will select a third independent accounting firm of recognized national standing, which is not the regular auditing firm of Parent or the Company (such selected independent accounting firm, whether pursuant to this sentence or the preceding sentence, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Independent Accounting Firm will act as arbitrator to determine (based solely upon presentations made by Parent and the Members Representative and not by independent audit or review) only those items still in dispute. The Purchaser and the Members Representative will instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report that specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting Firm as to each item in dispute and the resulting calculations and determination of the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and the Adjustment Amount. The Purchaser and the Members Representative will each use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination within 30 days after referral of the items to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. The determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and Adjustment Amount will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.03(i). Parent will revise the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Members Equity, Closing Working Capital and Adjustment Amount as appropriate to reflect the 

    ##### 

  

    

resolution of the issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.03 and Parent
will provide instructions to the Escrow Agent consistent with such
resolution. Any payment from the Escrow Fund for an Adjustment Amount shall
be payable (i) 75% in cash from the Escrow Amount and the cash proceeds from
the sale of any Escrow Shares or Escrow Warrants (the " _Proceeds_ ") and
(ii) 25% in Escrow Shares;  _provided_ , _that_ , the Members Representative
may elect to have an Adjustment Amount paid from the Escrow Amount or
Proceeds in cash in lieu of Escrow Shares in a percentage greater than 75% of
such Adjustment Amount. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm will be shared by Parent and the Members in proportion to the relative
amounts of the disputed amount (as ultimately resolved) determined to be for
the account of Parent and the Members, respectively. For example, if the
final Adjustment Amount is forty percent (40%) of the Parents original
Adjustment Amount as determined in accordance with Section 2.03(a), the
Members shall pay forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm and Parent shall pay the remaining sixty percent
(60%) of such fees and expenses. 

   

 (e) For purposes of complying with this Section 2.03, Parent and the Members Representative will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accounting Firm may request and as are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and each party will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Accounting Firm. Parent must require that the Independent Accounting Firm enter into a customary form of confidentiality agreement with respect to the work papers and other documents and information regarding the matters, including financial information contained in the Adjustment Notice and Dispute Notice, provided to the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.03. 

   

 (f) If the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.03 is less than or equal to $13,500,000, then no adjustment shall be made. If the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.03 is greater than the $13,500,000, then the Members will pay to Parent the amount of such difference pursuant to Section 2.03(i) below. 

   

 (g) If the Closing Members Equity as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.03 is greater than or equal to $14,200,000 (as determined without deducting the Transaction-Related Members Equity Charge), then no adjustment shall be made. If the Closing Members Equity as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.03 is less than the $14,200,000, then the Members will pay to Parent the amount of such difference pursuant to Section 2.03(i) below. 

   

 (h) If the Closing Working Capital is less than 14.0% of the average annualized monthly revenues of the Company using the three (3) completed months immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Target Working Capital_ "), an example of the calculation of which is set forth on Schedule 2.03(h) for the period ending June 30, 2006, then the Members will pay to Parent the amount of such difference pursuant to Section 2.03(i) below. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) All payments required to be made by the Members, on a pro rata basis in proportion to each Members share (carried to five decimal places) of the Company Interests, pursuant to Sections 2.03(f), 2.03(g) and 2.03(h) will first be satisfied by payment from the Escrow Amount and the Escrow Shares (based on the Escrow Per Share Market Value (as defined below) of the Parent Common Stock at such time) in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Members will be severally liable for any amount by which any payments required under Sections 2.03(f), 2.03(g) or 2.03(h) exceed the Escrow Fund. All adjustments to the Initial Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.03 will be applied to the Initial Merger Consideration to be received by each Member pro rata based in proportion to each Member\'s share (carried to five decimal point places) of the Initial Merger Consideration. The term " _Escrow Per Share Market Value_ " shall mean for any date, the price determined by calculating the average of the closing per share prices of the Parent Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange (" _AMEX_ ") (as reported on AMEX) or such other stock exchange on which Parent Common Stock may then be trading (based on a Trading Day closing at 4:02 p.m. New York City time) for the twenty days prior to any distribution date as described in the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (j) The payments pursuant to Sections 2.03(f), 2.03(g) and 2.03(h) will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Initial Merger Consideration and the Initial Merger Consideration as so adjusted is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Merger Consideration_." 

   

 SECTION 2.04 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Procedures_. From and after the Effective Time, a bank or trust company to be designated by Parent shall act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in effecting the exchange of the applicable Parent Shares, Parent Warrants, Redemption Liability Shares, if any, and Redemption Warrants, if any, for certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding membership interests of Company Interests (" _Company Interest Certificates_ ") and which were converted into the right to receive the applicable Parent Shares, Parent Warrants, Redemption Liability Shares, if and, and Redemption Warrants, if any, pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.08. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of Company Interest Certificates a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in a form approved by Parent and the Company and instructions for use in surrendering such Company Interest Certificates and receiving the applicable Parent Shares, Parent Warrants, Redemption Liability Shares, if any, and Redemption Warrants, if any, pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.08. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited in escrow with the Escrow Agent all of the Escrow Shares and Escrow Warrants in the names set forth on _Schedule 2.04(a)_ (collectively, the " _Escrow_   _Securities_ "). As used in this Agreement, " _Escrow Warrants_ " shall refer to all Parent Warrants and Redemption Warrants, if any, deposited in escrow with the Escrow Agent. 

   

 Upon the surrender of each Company Interest Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) Parent shall cause to be issued to the holder of such Company Interest Certificate in exchange therefor separate certificates representing the Parent Shares, Parent Warrants, Redemption Liability Shares, if any, and Redemption Warrants, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.08; 

  

 (ii) all Escrow Securities shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held as Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and 

  

 (iii) the Company Interest Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

  

 (b) _Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, the Members Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") with the Escrow Agent, or if the Escrow Agent is unwilling or unable to serve, then such other financial institution of at least $500,000,000 in total assets mutually acceptable to the Members Representative and Parent. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Parent shall deposit (i) one or more certificates in the name of the Escrow Agent representing the Escrow Securities and (ii) the Escrow Amount into an escrow account, which account is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "). Any Escrow Securities, the Escrow Amount and Proceeds in the Escrow Account are collectively referred to herein as the " _Escrow Fund_ ". The Escrow Agreement shall provide that so long as a bona fide, good faith claim for indemnification has not been made by Parent, that (i) the entirety of the Escrow Fund remain with the Escrow Agent for (18) eighteen months, (ii) after completion of (18) eighteen months post Closing, the Escrow Amount and that portion of Escrow Shares (and/or any Proceeds or common stock of Parent received by virtue of the exercise of Parent Warrants and Redemption Warrants) in excess of $3,000,000 in value based on the Escrow Per Share Market Value be released to the Members as well as the entirety of the Escrow Warrants, and (iii) upon completion of (60) sixty months after Closing, the Escrow Account shall be closed and all remaining Escrow Shares shall be released to the Members. In connection with such deposit of the Escrow Securities and Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent and as of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Interest will be deemed to have constructively received and deposited with the Escrow Agent each Members pro rata interest in the Escrow Fund as determined as of Closing by reference to such Members ownership of Company Interests (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time with respect to shares constituting the Escrow Fund) as reflected on the Company Interest Certificates, without any further action by the Members. Distributions of any Escrow Securities or the Escrow Fund or Proceeds from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, but shall occur no later than the end of the indemnity periods as set forth in  _Section 10.01_. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Members shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all the arrangements relating thereto, including, without limitation, the placement of the Escrow Securities, Escrow Amount and Proceeds in the Escrow Fund and the appointment of the Members Representative. No Escrow Securities contributed to the Escrow Fund shall be unvested or subject to any right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other condition in favor of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or other entity. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) In the event of a claim relating to any claim for indemnification any Parent Indemnified Person (as defined in Section 10.02) may have under Article X (" _Indemnification Claim_ "), Parent shall seek payment first out of the Escrow Fund. Such Indemnification Amounts shall be payable (i) 75% in cash from the Escrow Amount and Proceeds and (ii) 25% in Escrow Shares; provided, that, the Members Representative may elect to have an Indemnification Amount paid from the Escrow Amount or Proceeds in cash in lieu of Escrow Shares in a percentage greater than 75% of such Adjustment Amount. If the Escrow Fund has been reduced to zero, Parent shall then be entitled to seek payment for an unsatisfied Indemnification Amount directly from the Members, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Article X. 

  

 (c) _Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Escrow Shares comprising part of the Initial Merger Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Interest Certificate with respect to the Escrow Shares represented thereby until the holder of such Company Interest Certificate shall surrender such Company Interest Certificate in accordance with this _Section 2.04_. Dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Escrow Shares comprising part of the Merger Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the record owners of the Escrow Shares. 

   

 (d) _No Further Rights in Company Interests_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Parent Shares, the Parent Warrants, the Redemption Liability Shares and the Redemption Warrants issued upon the conversion of Company Interests in accordance with the terms hereof, including the registration rights applicable thereto, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Interests. 

   

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion and exchange of Company Interest Certificates, and no holder of Company Interest Certificates shall be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock. In the event that any holder of Company Interest would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares and fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder), then such holder will receive an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock rounded up or down to the nearest whole share (with amounts equal to 0.5 and greater being rounded up). 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Interest for any such shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly and legally delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law (as defined in Section 3.06(a));  _provided, however_ , that Parent shall promptly give the Members Representative written notice of any such occurrence and such holder of Company Interests shall have the opportunity to dispute the abandonment and reclaim the shares of Parent Common Stock and all related rights as if such occurrence had not occurred, provided such dispute is fairly determined for the benefit of the Member or Members affected. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Interest such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in _Section 3.15(c)_) Law, including but not limited to federal and state withholdings as related to the compensatory component of the Merger Consideration that relates to the Companys 2004 Incentive Plan. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Interest in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. Any amounts so withheld shall be properly and timely transmitted to the appropriate parties. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Interest Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Interest Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Interest Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Interest Certificate, the applicable Parent Shares (and dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_), Parent Warrants, Redemption Liability Shares (and dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_), and Redemption Warrants to which such person is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 SECTION 2.05 _Membership Interest Transfer Books_. Commencing on the date hereof, the membership interest transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares of Company Interest thereafter on the records of the Company other than as required to comply with the terms of this Agreement and the Plans. From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Interest Certificate shall cease to have any rights as a member of the Company, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. 

  

 SECTION 2.06 _Earnout Awards_. 

  

 (a) From time to time after the Effective Time, the Members shall be entitled to an earnout award payable in shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Earnout Award_ ") pursuant to the terms of Section 2.06 below. 

   

 (b) On the date on which any holder (a " _Warrant Holder_ ") of a warrant (other than a Parent Warrant and a Redemption Warrant) to purchase Parent Common Stock (an " _Index Warrant_ "), elects to exercise such Index Warrant (each a " _Measurement Date_ "), Parent shall calculate and record the average Trading Price (each an " _Earnout Per Share Market Value_ ") of the Parent Common Stock for each of the 3 trading days prior to such Measurement Date (each a " _Measurement Period_ "). As used herein, the term " _Trading Price_ " shall mean the closing trading price per share of Parent Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on 

    ##### 

  

    

the American Stock Exchange (as reported on AMEX) or such other stock
exchange on which the Parent Common Stock may then be trading. 

   

 (c) On June 30, 2007 (the " _Initial Determination Date_ "), Parent shall determine the initial Earnout Award payable to the Members for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on June 30, 2007 (the " _Initial Determination Period_ "). Subsequent Earnout Awards shall be determined on: 

   

 (i) June 30, 2008 (the " _Second Determination Date_ ") for the period beginning on July 1, 2007 and ending on June 30, 2008 (the " _Second Determination Period_ "); and 

  

 (ii) June 30, 2009 (the " _Third Determination Date_ ") for the period beginning on July 1, 2008 and ending on June 30, 2009 (the " _Third Determination Period_ "); and 

  

 (iii) April 30, 2010 (unless extended to June 30, 2010 by the mutual written consent of the parties hereto) (the " _Fourth Determination Date_ ", and together with the Initial Determination Date, the Second Determination Date and the Third Determination Date, each a " _Determination Date_ ") for the period beginning on July 1, 2009 and ending on April 30, 2010 (or June 30, 2010) (the " _Fourth Determination Period_ ", and together with the Initial Determination Period, the Second Determination Period and the Third Determination Period, each a " _Determination Period_ "). 

  

 (d) On each Determination Date, Parent shall calculate the respective Earnout Award as follows (an example of such calculation is set forth on _Schedule 2.06(d)_ attached hereto): 

   

 (i) first, for each exercise of an Index Warrant during such Determination Period, multiply (A) the respective Earnout Per Share Market Value for such exercise by (B) the number of shares issued pursuant to such Index Warrant exercise (the " _Total Exercised Warrant Value_ "); 

  

 (ii) second, calculate (A) the aggregate number of shares issued pursuant to all Index Warrant exercises during such Determination Period, (B) the aggregate Total Exercised Warrant Values from all exercises for such Determination Period and (C) the per share weighted average amount of the Total Exercised Warrant Values for all Index Warrant exercises during such Determination Period; 

  

 (iii) third, multiply (A) the number of shares calculated in Section 2.06(d)(ii)(A) by (B) $5.00; 

  

 (iv) fourth, subtract (A) the number determined in Section 2.06(d)(iii) from (B) the aggregate Total Exercised Warrant Values for such Determination Period; 

  

 (v) if the amount determined in Section 2.06(d)(iv) above is greater than zero, Parent shall issue to the Members shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the 

   ##### 

  

    

quotient of (A) the amount determined in Section 2.06(d)(iv) above divided by
(B) the amount determined in Section 2.06(d)(ii)(C) (" _Earnout Award Shares_
"). 

  

 (e) Within fifteen (15) days of each Determination Date, Parent shall provide written notice to the Members Representative as to the number of Earnout Award Shares, if any, (an " _Earnout Notice_ "). Such Earnout Notice shall also contain Parents calculation of such Earnout Award Shares pursuant to Section 2.06(c). 

   

 (f) Within 15 days after delivery of an Earnout Notice, the Members Representative will deliver to Parent a written response in which the Members Representative will either: 

   

 (i) agree in writing with the contents of the Earnout Notice, in which case such calculations of the Earnout Award Shares (the " _Earnout Award Calculation_ "), if any, will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.06; or 

  

 (ii) dispute Parents determination of the Earnout Award Calculations, if any, as set forth in a written notice (a " _Earnout Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed in good faith. 

  

 (g) If the Members Representative fails to take either of the foregoing actions within 15 days after delivery of the Earnout Notice, then the Company and Members will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted Parents determination of such Earnout Notice, in which case such determination of the Earnout Award Calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.06(j). 

   

 (h) If the Members Representative delivers an Earnout Dispute Notice to Parent within 10 days after delivery of the Earnout Notice, then Parent and the Members Representative will attempt in good faith, for a period of 15 days, to agree on the calculations for purposes of Section 2.06. Any resolution by Parent and the Members Representative during such 15-day period as to any disputed items will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.06. If Parent and the Members Representative do not resolve all disputed items by the end of 15 days after the date of delivery of the Earnout Dispute Notice, then Parent and the Members Representative will submit the remaining items in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm and the procedures set forth in Section 2.03(d) shall be utilized to resolve the disputed items. The determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to the Earnout Award Calculation will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.06. Parent will revise all of the affected changes in the Earnout Award Calculation as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.06. 

   

 (i) For purposes of complying with this Section 2.06, Parent and the Members Representative will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Firm may request and as are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and each party will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Firm.

contained in the Earnout Notice and Earnout Dispute Notice, provided to the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.06. 

   

 (j) Once the Earnout Calculation is finalized, Parent shall issue such Earnout Award Shares to the Members as determined by the Earnout Calculation pursuant to Section 2.06(k) and (j) herein. Notwithstanding if the amount determined in Section 2.06(d)(iv) above is zero or less than zero, Parent not shall issue any Earnout Award Shares to the Members. Parent shall promptly prepare and file with AMEX a Notification Form for Listing Additional Shares with respect to any Earnout Award Shares to be issued pursuant to Section 2.06 and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to such issuance of any Earnout Award Shares, approval for the listing of such Earnout Award Shares, subject to official notice to AMEX of issuance. 

   

 (k) In the event that the Members are issued Earnout Award Shares, all of such Earnout Award Shares and the possession thereof shall be given to the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable. All of the rights, duties and obligations with respect to said Earnout Award Shares shall be equivalent to the rights, duties and obligations with respect to the Parent Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, including but not limited to the rights granted to the Members under the Registration Rights Agreement. 

   

 (l) _Return of Parent Warrants and Redemption Warrants_. In exchange for an Earnout Award, each Member shall surrender a number of Parent Warrants and/or Redemption Warrants exercisable for an amount of Parent Common Stock equal to such Earnout Award to Parent, together with such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent. 

   

 (m) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Section 2.06, and no Member shall be entitled to receive a fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.06. In the event that any Member would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.06, then such Member will receive an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock rounded up or down to the nearest whole share (with amounts greater than 0.5 being rounded up). If the Parent Warrant or Redemption Warrant shall have been exercised in part, Parent shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Parent Warrants or Redemption Warrants, deliver to holder a new Parent Warrant or new Redemption Warrant, as the case may be, evidencing the rights of holder to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock called for by the Parent Warrant or the Redemption Warrant, which new Parent Warrant or Redemption Warrant, as the case may be, shall in all other respects be identical with the original Parent Warrant or the original Redemption Warrant. 

   

 SECTION 2.07 _Securities Laws Issues_. Parent shall issue the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants as provided in Section 2.01, the shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.06 of this Agreement and the Redemption Liability Shares and Redemption Warrants pursuant to a "private placement" exemption or exemptions from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and an exemption from qualification under the laws of the State of Texas and other applicable state securities laws notwithstanding that the Parent Shares,

There are no liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and
payable) upon the assets of Parent. Parent has never been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations, within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code. Parent is in full compliance with all the terms and conditions of any
Tax exemption or other Tax-sharing agreement or order of a foreign
government, and the consummation of the Merger will not have any adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemption
or other Tax-sharing agreement or order. Neither Parent nor any person on
behalf of Parent has entered into or will enter into any agreement or consent
pursuant to the collapsible corporation provisions of Section 341(f) of
the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income
tax Law) or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax Law) apply to

defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the United States
of America and such foreign country and Parent has not engaged in a trade or
business within any foreign country. Parent has never elected to be treated
as an S-corporation under Section 1362 of the Code or any corresponding
provision of Federal or state Law. All material elections with respect to
Parents Taxes made during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2005 are
reflected on Parents Tax Returns for such periods, copies of which have been
provided to the Company. After the date of this Agreement, no material
election with respect to Taxes will be made without the prior written consent
of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Parent is not party to any joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement
or contract that could be treated as a partnership for Federal income tax
purposes. Parent is not currently and never has been subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 6038A of the Code. There is no agreement,
contract or arrangement to which Parent is a party that could, individually
or collectively, result in the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible by reason of Sections 280G (as determined without regard to
Section 280G(b)(4)), 162 (other than 162(a)) or 404 of the Code. Parent is
not a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation
agreement (whether written or unwritten or arising under operation of Federal
Law as a result of being a member of a group filing consolidated Tax Returns,

unitary group, or under comparable Laws of other states or foreign
jurisdictions) that includes a party other than Parent nor does Parent owe
any amount under any such agreement. Parent has previously provided or made
available to the Company true and correct copies of all income, franchise, and
sales Tax Returns, and, as reasonably requested by the Company, prior to or
following the date hereof, presently existing information statements and 

    #####

holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during
the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.
Other than by reason of the Merger, Parent has not been and will not be
required to include any material adjustment in Taxable income for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code or
any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of
transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the Merger.

Parent will respond to any comments of the SEC and Parent will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will prepare and file any other filings required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or any other Federal, foreign or Blue Sky laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Each party will notify the other party promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other governmental officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for additional information and will supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any Other Filing.

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (provided that Parent shall not be
responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by
the Company relating to the Company or any other information furnished by the
Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to the extent the Company
information or its interpretation thereof has not been altered by Parent or
Parents representatives). The Company represents and warrants that the

 (c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Members pursuant to this Agreement are intended to be issued pursuant to the "private placement" exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and agree to fully cooperate with Parent in its efforts to ensure that the shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued pursuant to such private placement exemption; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty that such issuance in fact qualifies for such private placement exemption. Such Parent Shares shall be subject to a Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary in Article VIII hereof, in the event that Parent, based on advice of its counsel, has determined that the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement cannot be issued under the "private placement" exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, then at Parents sole and exclusive election the parties hereto shall take all action necessary to prepare and file on or before December 1, 2006 a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC which registers the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Form S-4 Alternative_").

 SECTION 10.04 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) For purposes of this Section 10.03, a party against which indemnification may be sought is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and the party which may be entitled to indemnification is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ". 

   

 (b) The obligations and liabilities of Indemnifying Parties under this Article X with respect to Losses arising from actual or threatened claims or demands by any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article X (" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim within 15 days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release an Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article X except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party 

    ##### 

  

    

within 15 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if (i) any such claim seeks,
in addition to or in lieu of monetary losses, any injunctive or
other equitable relief, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of the adequacy of the Escrow
Fund to provide indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement with respect to such proceeding,
(iii) there is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would
make it inappropriate (in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its
reasonable discretion) for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) settlement of, or an
adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim may establish (in the
good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party) a precedential custom or
practice adverse to the business interests of the Indemnified Party or would
increase the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party; _provided_   _further_ ,
that if by reason of the Third Party Claim a Lien, attachment,
garnishment, execution or other encumbrance is placed upon any of the
property or assets of such Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, if it
desires to exercise its right to assume such defense of the Third Party
Claim, must agree to use a portion of the Escrow Fund to furnish a
satisfactory indemnity bond to obtain the prompt release of such Lien,
attachment, garnishment, execution or other encumbrance. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it will conduct the defense
actively, diligently and at its own expense, and, subject to the limits of
this Agreement, it will hold all Indemnified Parties harmless from and
against all Losses caused by or arising out of any settlement thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys
control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party. Except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld), the Indemnifying Party will not, in the defense of
a Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement (i) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving to the Indemnified Party by the third party of a release from all
liability with respect to such suit, claim, action, or proceeding; (ii) unless
there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of Law by the
Indemnified Party (or any affiliate thereof), (B) any liability on the part
of the Indemnified Party (or any affiliate thereof) or (C) any violation of
the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims of a similar
nature that may be made by the same third party against the Indemnified Party
(or any affiliate thereof); or (iii) which exceeds the limits of
indemnification set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails or elects not to assume the defense of an Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party had the right to assume pursuant to Section 10.03(c), the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend or prosecute such claim in any manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate and may settle such claim after giving written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as such Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Losses incurred in connection with such settlement. If no settlement of such Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Losses arising out of any judgment rendered with respect to such claim. Any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be promptly 

    ##### 

  

    

paid as suffered, incurred or accrued (in accordance with GAAP). If the
Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim which it has the right to assume hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall
have no obligation to do so. 

   

 (e) In the event that the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.03(c), the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend or prosecute such claim and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate after giving written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Losses incurred in connection with such judgment or settlement. In such case, the Indemnified Party shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party. If no settlement of such Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnified Party may seek prompt reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for any Losses arising out of any judgment rendered with respect to such claim. Any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be promptly paid as suffered, incurred or accrued (in accordance with GAAP).
