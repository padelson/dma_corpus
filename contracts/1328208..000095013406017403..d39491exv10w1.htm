serve, then such other financial institution of at least $500,000,000 in total assets mutually
acceptable to the Members&#146; Representative and Parent. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, Parent shall deposit (i)&nbsp;one or more certificates in the name of the Escrow Agent
representing the Escrow Securities and (ii)&nbsp;the Escrow Amount into an escrow account, which account
is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the &#147;<U>Escrow Account</U>&#148;). Any Escrow Securities, the
Escrow Amount and Proceeds in the Escrow Account are collectively referred to herein as the
&#147;<U>Escrow Fund</U>&#148;. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that so long as a bona fide, good faith
claim for indemnification has not been made by Parent, that (i)&nbsp;the entirety of the Escrow Fund
remain with the Escrow Agent for (18)&nbsp;eighteen months, (ii)&nbsp;after completion of (18)&nbsp;eighteen
months post Closing, the Escrow Amount and that portion of Escrow Shares (and/or any Proceeds or
common stock of Parent received by virtue of the exercise of Parent Warrants and Redemption
Warrants) in excess of $3,000,000 in value based on the Escrow Per Share Market Value be released
to the Members as well as the entirety of the Escrow Warrants, and (iii)&nbsp;upon completion of (60)
sixty months after Closing, the Escrow Account shall be closed and all remaining Escrow Shares
shall be released to the Members. In connection with such deposit of the Escrow Securities and
Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent and as of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Interest
will be deemed to have constructively received and deposited with the Escrow Agent each Member&#146;s
pro rata interest in the Escrow Fund as determined as of Closing by reference to such Member&#146;s
ownership of Company Interests (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon any stock split,
stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time with respect to
shares constituting the Escrow Fund) as reflected on the Company Interest Certificates, without any
further action by the Members. Distributions of any Escrow Securities or the Escrow Fund or
Proceeds from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement, but shall occur no later than the end of the indemnity periods as set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U>. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Members shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all the arrangements relating
thereto, including, without limitation, the placement of the Escrow Securities, Escrow Amount and
Proceeds in the Escrow Fund and the appointment of the Members&#146; Representative. No Escrow
Securities contributed to the Escrow Fund shall be unvested or subject to any right of repurchase,
risk of forfeiture or other condition in favor of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or other
entity.

Authority that could, if determined adversely to Parent, materially and adversely affect the
liability of Parent for Taxes. There are no liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet
due and payable) upon the assets of Parent. Parent has never been a member of an affiliated group
of corporations, within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1504 of the Code. Parent is in full compliance with
all the terms and conditions of any Tax exemption or other Tax-sharing agreement or order of a
foreign government, and the consummation of the Merger will not have any adverse effect on the
continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemption or other Tax-sharing agreement or
order. Neither Parent nor any person on behalf of Parent has entered into or will enter into any
agreement or consent pursuant to the collapsible corporation provisions of Section 341(f) of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax Law) or agreed to have
Section&nbsp;341(f)(2) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax
Law) apply to any disposition of any asset owned by Parent. None of the assets of Parent is
property that Parent is required to treat as being owned by any other person pursuant to the
so-called &#147;safe harbor lease&#148; provisions of former Section&nbsp;168(f)(8) of the Code. None of the

election under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.1502-32(f)(2) or a consent dividend election under Section&nbsp;565 of the
Code. Parent has never been a party (either as a distributing corporation, a distributed
corporation or otherwise) to any transaction intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;355 of the Code or
any corresponding provision of state Law. Parent has not participated in (and will not participate
in) an international boycott within the meaning of Section&nbsp;999 of the Code. Parent does not have
and has not had a permanent establishment in any foreign country, as defined in any applicable Tax
treaty or convention between the United States of America and such foreign country and Parent has
not engaged in a trade or business within any foreign country. Parent has never elected to be
treated as an S-corporation under Section&nbsp;1362 of the Code or any corresponding provision of
Federal or state Law. All material elections with respect to Parent&#146;s Taxes made during the fiscal
year ending December&nbsp;31, 2005 are reflected on Parent&#146;s Tax Returns for such periods, copies of
which have been provided to the Company. After the date of this Agreement, no material election
with respect to Taxes will be made without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent is not party to any joint venture,
partnership, or other arrangement or contract that could be treated as a partnership for Federal
income tax purposes. Parent is not currently and never has been subject to the reporting
requirements of Section&nbsp;6038A of the Code. There is no agreement, contract or arrangement to which
Parent is a party that could, individually or collectively, result in the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible by reason of Sections&nbsp;280G (as determined without regard to Section

Returns, under operation of certain state Laws as a result of being a member
 of a unitary group, or
under comparable Laws of other states or foreign jurisdictions) that includes a party other than
Parent nor does Parent owe any amount under any such agreement. Parent has previously provided or
