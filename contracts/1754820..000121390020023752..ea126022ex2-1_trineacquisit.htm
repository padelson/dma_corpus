Article III 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

(a) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Acquiror Stockholder, (i) each share of Company Preferred
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than the Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be converted into the
right to receive, and the holder of such share of Company Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive, as applicable, the Per Share Preferred Stock
Consideration as if the Merger were a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation) and (ii) each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be
converted into the right to receive, and the holder of such share of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration. Following the conversion of the shares of Company Preferred
Stock into the right to receive the applicable Per Share Preferred Stock
Consideration and the conversion of the shares of the Company Common Stock
into the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 3.01(a)_, all of the shares of Company Preferred Stock and

cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the
applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration or the Per Share Common
Stock Consideration, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require the
Acquiror to issue any number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (deemed to

21

the part of any holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001

Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall thereupon be
converted into and become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company
and all such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company as of immediately following the Effective
Time; and

  



  

(c) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and
no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

3.02 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number, value (including dollar value) or amount contained herein which is
based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and
the holders of Acquiror Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 3.02_
shall not be construed to permit Acquiror, the Company, or Merger Sub to take
any action with respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

3.03 _Delivery of Per Share Common Stock Consideration and Per Share
Preferred Stock Consideration_.

as may be required by a paying agent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall have customary representations
and warranties as to title, authorization, execution and delivery.

  



  

(b) Upon the receipt of a Letter of Transmittal (accompanied with all Company
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock, to the extent such shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock are certificated) duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by Acquiror, the Company Stockholder holding such
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration and the applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, as
the case may be, into which such shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to _Section
3.01(a)_. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.03(b)_, each
share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall be deemed at
any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Common Stock Consideration and the
applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, as the case may be, which
the Company Stockholders holding shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, were entitled to receive in respect
of such shares pursuant to this _Section 3.03(b)_. The delivery of the
applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration shall be made as if the
Merger were a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Company Certificate
of Incorporation) and pursuant to an allocation schedule prepared by the
Company, which allocation schedule shall be delivered to the Acquiror not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration or the applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, as
the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance
with this _Article III_.

  



  

3.05 _Conversion of Company Equity Awards._

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the
extent then outstanding and unexercised, shall automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including applicable
vesting conditions (after such conversion, each a " _Rollover Option_ ") the
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock. The per share exercise price for
the Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rollover Option
shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price for the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent.

  



  

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted
Stock, to the extent then unvested and outstanding, shall
automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the number of shares of restricted Acquiror Common
Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
applicable vesting conditions (after such conversion, " _Rollover Restricted
Stock_ ") determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Per Share Common Stock Consideration.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit,
to the extent then outstanding, shall automatically, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into restricted stock units of
the Acquiror with respect to that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Per Share Common Stock Consideration (after such
conversion, " _Rollover Restricted Stock Units_ "). Except as provided herein,
the Rollover Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Company Restricted Stock Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including applicable vesting
conditions.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in this _Section
3.05_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are required to cause
the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

3.06 _Withholding_. Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Company and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts otherwise deliverable or payable under this
Agreement such amounts that any such Persons are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to any of the deliveries and payments contemplated by
this Agreement under the Code or any other applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that before making any deduction or withholding pursuant to this
_Section 3.06_ other than as a result of a failure to deliver the deliverable
set forth in _Section 8.03(d)_ or with respect to compensatory payments made
pursuant to _Section 3.05_ , Acquiror shall give the Company at least five (5)
days prior written notice of any anticipated deduction or withholding
(together with any legal basis therefor) to provide the Company with
sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other documentation from the
relevant equity holders or take such other steps in order to avoid such
deduction or withholding and shall reasonably consult and cooperate with the
Company in good faith to attempt to reduce or eliminate any amounts that
would otherwise be deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 3.06_. To
the extent that Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or
their respective Affiliates withholds such amounts with respect to any Person
and properly remits such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to or
on behalf of such Person for all purposes. In the case of any such payment
payable to employees of the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the
Merger treated as compensation, the parties shall cooperate to pay
such amounts through the Company's or its Subsidiary's payroll to facilitate
applicable withholding.

  



  

3.07 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder
of Acquiror Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Acquiror shall pay to each former Company Stockholder who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Acquiror Common Stock to
which such holder otherwise would have been entitled but for this _Section
3.07_) multiplied by (ii) an amount equal to the VWAP of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock for the 20 Trading Days prior to the date that is three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

3.08 _Payment of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) On the Closing Date following the Closing, Acquiror shall pay or cause to
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds all fees and
disbursements of the Company or the Company Stockholders for outside counsel
incurred in connection with the Transactions and fees and expenses of the
Company for any other agents, advisors, consultants, experts and financial
advisors employed by the Company incurred in connection with the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Outstanding Company Expenses_ ").

  



  

(b) On the Closing Date following the Closing, Acquiror shall pay or cause to
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds all fees and
disbursements of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Sponsor for outside counsel and
fees and expenses of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Sponsor or for any other
agents, advisors, consultants, experts and financial advisors employed by or
on behalf of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Sponsor incurred in connection with
the Transactions (collectively, the " _Outstanding Acquiror Expenses_ ").

  



  

3.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and owned by a Company Stockholder who is entitled to demand
and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Common Stock Consideration or the Per Share Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, (i) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to
exist and (ii) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only
such rights as may be granted to him, her or it under the DGCL. If any such
Company Stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses
such Company Stockholder's right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL
or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock
Consideration or the applicable Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration,
as the case may be, in accordance with this _Article III_. The Company shall
give Acquiror prompt notice (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Acquiror shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
or commit to do any of the foregoing.

breach on the part of Acquiror or the Subscribers party to Subscription
Agreements executed as of the date hereof, (ii) assuming the conditions set
forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.02 _will be satisfied, constitute a
failure to satisfy a condition on the part of Acquiror or the Subscriber party

6.02  _Inspection_. Subject to confidentiality obligations and similar
restrictions that may be applicable to information furnished to the Company
or its Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' possession from time to time, and except for any information
which (x) relates to interactions with prospective buyers of the Company
or the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
or (y) in the judgment of legal counsel of the Company would result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege or other privilege from disclosure or would

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Acquiror and its Representatives
reasonable access during the Interim Period, during normal business hours and

Representatives under this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement prior to the Effective Time.

contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall comply promptly but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof with the
notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to submit, as soon as practicable, any other
required applications or filings pursuant to any Antitrust Laws and furnish
to the Acquiror as promptly as reasonably practicable all information
required for any application or other filing required to be made by the
Acquiror pursuant to any Antitrust Law. The Company shall (i)
substantially comply with any Information or Document Requests and (ii)
request early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act.
The Company shall promptly notify the Acquiror of any substantive
communication with any Governmental Authority or third party with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and furnish to Acquiror

any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall permit counsel to Acquiror an opportunity to
review in advance, and the Company shall consider in good faith the views

shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority to delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be

Authority, Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance

Acquiror under this _Section 6.03_ as "outside counsel only." Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.03 or
any other provision of this Agreement shall require or obligate the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, and Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, agree or otherwise be required to, take any action with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including selling,
divesting, or otherwise disposing of, licensing, holding separate, or taking
or committing to take any action that limits in any respect its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any business,
products, rights, services, licenses, assets or properties of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any interest therein. Acquiror
shall pay 50% of all filing fees payable to the Regulatory Consent Authorities

6.04  _Termination of Certain Agreements_. On and as of the Closing, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the Contracts listed on
_Schedule 6.04(a)_ to be terminated without any further force and effect and
without any cost or other liability or obligation to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and there shall be no further obligations of any of the
relevant parties thereunder following the Closing.

  



  

6.05  _No Acquiror Common Stock Transactions_. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its
stockholders shall engage in any transactions involving the securities of
Acquiror without the prior consent of Acquiror. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to require each of its Subsidiaries and stockholders
to comply with the foregoing sentence.

  



  

6.06  _No Claim Against the Trust Account_. The Company acknowledges that the
Acquiror is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect a
merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination
involving the Company and one or more businesses or assets, and the Company
has read Acquiror's final prospectus, dated March 14, 2019 and other
Acquiror SEC Reports, the Acquiror Organizational Documents, and the Trust
Agreement and understands that Acquiror has established the Trust Account
described therein for the benefit of Acquiror's public stockholders and that
disbursements from the Trust Account are available only in the limited
circumstances set forth therein. The Company further acknowledges and agrees
that the Acquiror's sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of the
Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its securities,
and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited in the Trust
Account for the benefit of its public stockholders. The Company further
acknowledges that, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, in
the event of termination of this Agreement, another Business Combination, are
or is not consummated by March 19, 2021 or such later date as approved by the
stockholders of Acquiror to complete a Business Combination, Acquiror will be
obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust
Account. Accordingly, the Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
hereby waives any past, present or future claim of any kind against, and any
right to access, the Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust Account and
Acquiror to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them
by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not
seek recourse against the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever,
including, without limitation, for any Willful Breach of this Agreement. This
_Section 6.06_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

6.07  _Proxy Solicitation; Other Actions_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide Acquiror, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof audited financial
statements, including consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations,
statements of cash flows, and statements of stockholders equity of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018
and December 31, 2019, in each case, prepared in accordance with GAAP and
Regulation S-X. The Company shall be available to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to make their officers and
employees available to, in each case, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advanced notice, Acquiror and its counsel in connection with (i)
the drafting of the Registration Statement and (ii) responding in a timely
manner to comments on the Registration Statement from the SEC. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Acquiror in connection with Acquiror's preparation for
inclusion in the Registration Statement of pro forma financial statements that
comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the rules and
regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff of the SEC) to the extent
such pro forma financial statements are required by Form S-4.

  



  

(b) From and after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, the Company will give Acquiror prompt
written notice of any action taken or not taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or of any development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries,
in any such case which is known by the Company, that would cause the
Registration Statement to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , that, if any such action shall be taken or fail to be taken or
such development shall otherwise occur, Acquiror and the Company shall
cooperate fully to cause an amendment or supplement to be made promptly to
the Registration Statement, such that the Registration Statement no longer
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that no information received by Acquiror pursuant to
this _Section 6.07_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the party who
disclosed such information, and no such information shall be deemed to change,
supplement or amend the Schedules.

6.08  _Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.08_, from the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01_, the Company shall not,
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or requests for information with respect to, or the
making of, any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person
relating to any proposal, offer, inquiry or request for information that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, confidentiality agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement executed in accordance with _Section 6.08(b)(iii)_), merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement for or
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing; _provided_ , that it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the Company Board made in accordance with _Section
6.08(b) _or _Section 6.08(c)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach or
violation of this _Section 6.08(a)_. The Company also agrees that
immediately following the execution of this Agreement it shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to, cease any solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto and their
respective Representatives) conducted heretofore in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for information that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company also agrees that within three (3) Business Days of the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall request each Person (other than the parties
hereto and their respective Representatives) that has prior to the date
hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company (and with whom the Company has had
contact in twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement regarding
the acquisition of the Company) to return or destroy all confidential
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof and terminate access to any physical or
electronic data room maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) notify, in writing, Acquiror of the receipt of any inquiry,
proposal, offer or request for information received after the date hereof that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of the material
terms of, and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making, such
inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information and an unredacted copy of
any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer made in writing or, if
not in writing, a written description of the material terms and conditions of
such inquiry, proposal or offer (and shall include any other documents
evidencing or specifying the terms of such proposal, offer, inquiry or
request). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day) keep Acquiror reasonably informed of any material developments with
respect to any such inquiry, proposal, offer, request for information or
Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto and copies of any
additional written materials received by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow
for a confidential _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
result from a material breach of this _Section 6.08_) to be made to the
Company or the Company Board so long as the Company promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day thereafter) notifies Acquiror thereof
(including the identity of such counterparty) after granting any such waiver,
amendment or release and the Company Board determines prior to the grant of
such waiver, amendment or release in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of the Company Board
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.08_ by any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, or any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
respective Representatives acting on the Company's or one of its
Subsidiaries' behalf, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
6.08_ by the Company.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.08(a)_ or
_Section 8.02(e)_, this Agreement shall not prevent the Company or the
Company Board from:

  



  

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that this clause (i) shall not be
deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board to effect a Company Change
in Recommendation except in accordance with _Sections 6.08(c)_ and _6.08(d)_ ;

  



  

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, contacting and
engaging in discussions with any Person or group and their
respective Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of
_Section 6.08(a)_, solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal and the terms thereof;

  



  

(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, (A) contacting and
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person and its
Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of _Section
6.08(a)_ (which negotiations or discussions need not be solely for
clarification purposes) and (B) providing access to the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' properties, books and records and providing information or
data in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
_Section 6.08(a)_, in each case, if the Company Board (I) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal, (II) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (III) has received from
the Person so requesting such information an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall
provide to Acquiror and Merger Sub any material non-public information or
data that is provided to any Person given such access that was not previously
made available to Acquiror or Merger Sub prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours thereof);

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, making a Company
Change in Recommendation (only to the extent permitted by  _Section 6.08(c)_
or _Section 6.08(d)_); or

  



  

(v) resolving, authorizing, committing or agreeing to take any of the
foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted by the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv).

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.08_ to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and
outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _Section
6.08_, that (i) such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the
failure to take the actions specified in clause (A) or (B) of this _Section
6.08(c)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Company or the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Approval, (A) make a Company Change in Recommendation or (B)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_ to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ ,
that the Company pays to Acquiror the Company Termination Payment required to
be paid pursuant to _Section 10.02(b) _at or prior to the time of such
termination (it being agreed that such termination shall not be effective
unless such fee is so paid); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company will
not be entitled to make a Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01(e)_ unless (x) the Company
delivers to Acquiror a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") advising
Acquiror that the Company Board proposes to take such action and
containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action of the Company Board, and (y) at or after
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (such
period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on
which the Company delivered the Company Notice (it being understood that any
material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior
Proposal and shall require a new notice but with an additional four
(4) Business Day (instead of five (5) Business Day) period from the date of
such notice), the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good
faith (1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Acquiror (if any) were to be given effect and (2) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation or so terminate would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Acquiror, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Acquiror and its
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.08_ or _Section 8.02(e)_ to
the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite
Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to an
Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or
the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval,
make a Company Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , that the Company will
not be entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, a Company Change in
Recommendation unless (i) the Company delivers to Acquiror a written notice
(an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising Acquiror that the Company Board
proposes to take such action and containing the material facts underlying the
Company Board's determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii)
at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Intervening Event Notice (such period from the time the Intervening Event
Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th)
Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Intervening Event Notice (it being understood that any material development
with respect to an Intervening Event shall require a new notice but with an
additional four (4) Business Day (instead of five (5) Business Day) period
from the date of such notice), the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "),
the Company Board reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
If requested by Acquiror, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their
Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, engage in good
faith negotiations with Acquiror and its Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the
need for a Company Change in Recommendation.

meanings assigned below:

  



  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or

income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
any direct or indirect acquisition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets

owning such assets, (C) acquisition of beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the total voting power of the

the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (D) any issuance or sale or other
disposition (including by way of merger, reorganization, division,

70

 



    



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide and written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof, that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 6.08_, that the Company Board in good faith
determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor(s)) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms and would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
(solely in their capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated hereby
after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in
good faith by the Company Board, including legal, financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other aspects of
such proposal and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any offer by Acquiror to amend the terms of this Agreement,
termination or break-up fee and conditions to consummation);  _provided_ ,
that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term herein,
except that the references to "20%" in such definition shall be deemed to be
references to "80%".

  



  

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, fact, development, circumstance
or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Acquisition Proposal, Superior
Proposal, any changes in capital markets or any declines or improvements in
financial markets) that materially affects the business, assets, operations
or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that
was not known and was not reasonably foreseeable to the Company or the Company
Board as of the date hereof (or the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date hereof), and that becomes

Agreement from any holder of Company Preferred Stock who has been designated
by the parties hereto to execute that agreement but has not done so prior to
the time of the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(c) Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith with the Regulatory Consent
Authorities and exercise its reasonable best efforts to undertake promptly
any and all action required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the
Termination Date) and any and all action necessary or advisable to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove any impediment under Antitrust Law or the actual
or threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of
any Regulatory Consent Authority or the issuance of any Governmental Order
that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the Merger, including selling, divesting, or otherwise
disposing of, licensing, holding separate, or taking or committing to take
any action that limits in any respect the Acquiror's or the Company's freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any business, products,
rights, services, licenses, assets or properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.01 _or any other provision of this
Agreement shall require or obligate Acquiror or any other Person to take any
actions with respect to Acquiror's Affiliates, the Sponsor, the Subscriber,
their respective Affiliates and any investment funds or investment vehicles
affiliated with, or managed or advised by, Acquiror's Affiliates, the Sponsor,
the Subscriber or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood
in the private equity industry) or investment of Acquiror's Affiliates,
Sponsor or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle.

  



  

(d) Acquiror shall promptly notify the Company of any substantive

third party or Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Acquiror shall permit counsel to the
Company an opportunity to review in advance, and Acquiror shall consider in
good faith the views of such counsel in connection with, any proposed
communications by Acquiror or its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
Acquiror shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the
HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority to delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Acquiror agrees to provide the Company and
its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to participate in
any substantive meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone,
between Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Any materials exchanged
in connection with this _Section 7.01_ may be redacted or withheld as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns of
legal counsel of Acquiror, and to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company or other competitively sensitive material; _provided_ , that
the Acquiror may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any materials
provided to the Company under this _Section 7.01_ as "outside counsel only."

purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, or take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation, or the taking of any other action, would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents,
orders or declarations of any Regulatory Consent Authorities or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby; (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the restrictions and obligations set forth in this _Section
7.01(f)_ shall not apply to or be binding upon Acquiror's Affiliates, the
Sponsor, the Subscriber, their respective Affiliates or any investment funds
or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by,
Acquiror's Affiliates, the Sponsor, the Subscriber or any portfolio company
(as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or
investment of Acquiror's Affiliates, the Sponsor, the Subscriber or of any
such investment fund or investment vehicle.

  



  

7.02  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Company
agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would have been permitted under applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain for a period of not less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in its certificate of
incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of such certificates of incorporation (if
applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume,
and be liable for, and shall cause the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.02_.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or
shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently
covered by the Company's or its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives)
on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror or its Subsidiaries be
required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended under the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six-year
"tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms
of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted
or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained
under this _Section 7.02_ shall be continued in respect of such claim
until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 7.02_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror and the
Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.02_. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company under this _Section 7.02_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any present and former
director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to whom this
_Section 7.02_ applies without the consent of the affected Person.

inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or oral relating to any
Business Combination (a " _Business Combination Proposal_ ") other than (i)
with the Company, its stockholders and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives or (ii) to the extent that the Acquiror Board determines in
good faith, in response to an Acquiror Intervening Event, that the failure to

applicable Law. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or

_Article VI_ or _Article VII_, including the obligations of the Company and
Acquiror with respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and
applications described in _Section 6.03_ and _Section 7.01_, respectively,

each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use

(and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be reasonably
necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental

Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee

(a) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Acquiror shall prepare, with the assistance of the Company, and
cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, and including the Proxy Statement
and the Consent Solicitation Statement contained therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Acquiror Common Stock to be issued under this
Agreement, which Registration Statement will also contain the Proxy Statement
and the Consent Solicitation Statement. Each of Acquiror and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement to comply with the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of
Acquiror and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may
reasonably be requested by the other party in connection with such actions and
the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the

Statement to be mailed to stockholders of Acquiror.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(b) Each of Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and mutually agree upon
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), any response to
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement
and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed in response thereto. If
Acquiror or the Company becomes aware that any information contained in the
Registration Statement shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or that the Registration Statement is required to be amended in order
to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such party shall promptly inform the
other parties and (ii) Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement. Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, as applicable, in each case pursuant to
applicable Law and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Acquiror Organizational Documents. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall
provide the other parties with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform such other parties of any oral comments, that Acquiror receives from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement promptly after
the receipt of such comments and shall give the other parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written or oral responses to
such comments prior to responding to the SEC or its staff.

  



  

(c) Acquiror agrees to include provisions in the Proxy Statement and to take
reasonable action related thereto, with respect to (i) approval of the
Business Combination (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) and the
adoption and approval of this Agreement (the " _Transaction Proposal_ "),
(ii) approval of the Acquiror Charter Amendment and the Acquiror AandR
Charter (the " _Amendment Proposal_ ") and each change to the Acquiror AandR
Charter that is required to be separately approved, (iii) to the extent
required by the NYSE listing rules, approval of the issuance of the Aggregate
Preferred Stock Consideration and the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
together with the Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements (the " _NYSE Proposal_ "), (iv) the approval and
adoption of the Acquiror Equity Plan (the " _Acquiror Equity Plan Proposal_
"), (v) adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to permit further
solicitation of proxies because there are not sufficient votes to approve and
adopt any of the foregoing proposals and (vi) approval of any other proposals
reasonably agreed by Acquiror and the Company to be necessary or appropriate
in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby (the " _Additional
Proposal_ " and together with the Transaction Proposal, the Amendment
Proposal, the NYSE Proposal and the Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal,
the " _Proposals_ "). The Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal shall
provide that an aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the percentage set forth on Schedule 8.02(c) of the outstanding shares of
Acquiror Common Stock as of Closing shall be reserved for issuance pursuant to
the Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to annual increases as provided
therein. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Proposals
shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which Acquiror shall
propose to be acted on by Acquiror's stockholders at the Special Meeting.

(d) Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable, (i) establish the record date (which record date shall be
mutually agreed with the Company) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Special Meeting in accordance with the DGCL, (ii) after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to Acquiror's stockholders in
compliance with applicable Law and (iii) after the Registration Statement is

of Acquiror Common Stock to vote in accordance with the recommendation of the
Acquiror Board with respect to each of the Proposals. Acquiror shall, through
the Acquiror Board, recommend to its stockholders that they approve the
Proposals (the " _Acquiror Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the
Acquiror Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, unless the Acquiror
Board shall have changed the recommendation in accordance with this _Section
8.02(d)_. The Acquiror Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof
shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Acquiror Board
Recommendation (an " _Acquiror Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that
if, at any time prior to obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, the
Acquiror Board determines in good faith, in response to an Acquiror
Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make an Acquiror Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Acquiror or
the Acquiror Board may, prior to obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval,
make an Acquiror Change in Recommendation; _provided further_ , that Acquiror
will not be entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, an Acquiror Change
in Recommendation unless (A) Acquiror delivers to the Company a
written notice (an " _Acquiror Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising the
Company that the Acquiror Board proposes to take such action and containing
the material facts underlying the Acquiror Board's determination that an
Acquiror Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged that such
Acquiror Intervening Event Notice shall not itself constitute a breach
of this Agreement), and (B) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which Acquiror
delivered the Acquiror Intervening Event Notice (such period from the time the
Acquiror Intervening Event Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City
time on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which
Acquiror delivered the Acquiror Intervening Event Notice (it being understood
that any material development with respect to an Acquiror Intervening Event
shall require a new notice but with an additional four (4) Business Day
(instead of five (5) Business Day) period from the date of such notice), the
" _Acquiror Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Acquiror Board reaffirms
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make an Acquiror Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by the Company,
Acquiror will and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, during the Acquiror Intervening Event Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with the Company and its
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for an Acquiror Change in Recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.02(d)_, if on a
date for which the Special Meeting is scheduled, Acquiror has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
to obtain the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Acquiror shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Special Meeting; provided, that the
Special Meeting, without the prior written consent of the Company, (x) may not
be adjourned to a date that is more than twenty (20) Business Days after the
date for which the Special Meeting was originally scheduled or the
most recently adjourned Special Meeting (excluding any adjournments required
by applicable Law) and (y) is held no later than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Termination Date. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquiror
Intervening Event_ " means any material event, fact, development,
circumstance or occurrence that (i) was not known and was not reasonably
foreseeable to the Acquiror Board as of the date hereof and that becomes
known to the Acquiror Board after the date of this Agreement and (ii) does
not relate to clearance of the Merger by any Regulatory Consent Agency or any
other applicable Laws, including any action in connection therewith taken
pursuant to or required to be taken pursuant to Section 7.01; provided,
however, that (1) any change in the price or trading volume of Acquiror
Common Stock, (2) the Company meeting, failing to meet or exceeding financial
or other projections or predictions and (3) any delays in production of the
Company's products shall not be taken into account for purposes of

(e) The Company shall solicit the Company Requisite Approval via written
consent as soon as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement
becomes effective. In connection therewith, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) establish the record date
(which record date shall be mutually agreed with Acquiror) for determining the
Company Stockholders entitled to provide such written consent, (ii) cause the
Consent Solicitation Statement to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law and (iii) unless a Company
Change in Recommendation has been made, solicit written consents from the
Company Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Stockholders that
they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation
Statement, subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.02(e)_. The Company
Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof shall) (i) change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clause (i) or (ii), a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ")
except in accordance with _Sections 6.08(c) _and _6.08(d)_. The Company will
provide Acquiror with copies of all stockholder consents it receives within
one (1) Business Day of receipt. If the Company Requisite Approval is
obtained, then promptly following the receipt of the required written
consents, the Company will prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have
not consented the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company's
obligation to solicit written consents from the Company Stockholders to give
the Company Requisite Approval in accordance with this _Section
8.02(e) _shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, or by any Company Change in

the Transactions from the terms described in this Agreement, cause all Tax
Returns to be filed on a basis consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

all other parties of any challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by any

make any public announcement or issue any public communication regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any matter related to

case Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to coordinate such announcement or communication with the
other party, prior to announcement or issuance and allow the other party a

investors and prospective investors without the consent of any other party
hereto; and _provided_ , _further_ , that subject to _Section 6.02_ and this

Related Parties against the Company or any other Company Related Party for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach (excluding any Willful Breach) of, or failure to perform under, this
Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and upon

based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,

rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This

and the same instrument.

are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references
herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of

disclosure in such Schedule. Certain information set forth in the Schedules
is included solely for informational purposes.

  



  

11.09  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may

contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties,
covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the

as expressly set forth or referenced in this Agreement and the Confidentiality

11.10  _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties shall
not restrict the ability of the board of directors of any of the parties to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01_ or to cause such
party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
11.10_.

or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement,
they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of
this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law
and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or
unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the parties.

11.12  _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or,
if such court declines to exercise jurisdiction, any federal or state court
located in New York County, New York, and each of the parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
Action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not
to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any
manner permitted by Law, or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise
proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to
enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section
11.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

11.13  _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 10.01_, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties
would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
11.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

  



  

11.14  _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement), (a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement
and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub under
this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.15  _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements
in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and other
provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no liability after the
Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part
after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring after
the Closing and (b) this _Article XI_.
