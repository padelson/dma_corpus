_provided_ that the Closing Date shall  not occur prior to February 10, 2020.

 

Section 2.2 _Share Purchase_. At the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Buyer shall purchase from Seller, and Seller
shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver  to Buyer, the Shares, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Liens arising under securities Laws.

 

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Estimated     Purchase Price_. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Company's
good faith estimate of the  Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_
") pursuant to which the Company shall use, for purposes of calculation of

propose comments to the Estimated Closing Statement, and the  Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, its accountants and other representatives in
such review and consider in good faith Buyer's appropriate proposed changes to
the Estimated Closing Statement; _provided_ , for the avoidance of  doubt,
that in the event of any disagreement regarding changes to the Estimated
Closing Statement, Seller's determination shall control for purposes of the
Closing. Promptly following delivery of the Estimated  Closing Statement, at
Buyer's reasonable request, Seller shall, and shall cause the Group Companies
to, make the Group Companies' financial records, the Group Companies' books
and records and the working papers of the Group Companies'  accountants
prepared in connection with preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement
available to Buyer and its accountants and other representatives at reasonable
times during the review by Buyer of the Estimated Closing Statement. Seller 
shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, make reasonably available
applicable personnel employed by the Group Companies or Seller to answer any
questions that Buyer may have during its review of the Estimated Closing
Statement. At  the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Estimated Purchase
Price as follows:

 

(i) (A) $1,500,000     of cash (such amount, the " _Adjustment Escrow
Amount_ ") shall be deposited into an adjustment escrow account (the "
_Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), which shall be established pursuant to an
escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_  attached hereto
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which Escrow Agreement shall be entered into on
the Closing Date among Seller, Buyer and Citibank NA (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")

 

 

-15-  

and (B) $2,500,000 of cash (such amount, the " _Costa Rica Escrow Amount_ ")
shall be deposited into an escrow account (the " _Costa     Rica Escrow
Account_ "), which shall be established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

 

(ii) an     amount shall be paid to or on behalf of Seller (to one or more
accounts designated by Seller) equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, _minus_
the Adjustment Escrow Amount _minus_ the Costa Rica Escrow Amount; and

 

(iii) an amount shall be paid in respect of the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness and the Unpaid Seller Expenses, in each case, in the amounts set
forth on the Estimated Closing Statement delivered hereunder and pursuant to
wire instructions  provided to Buyer by Seller prior to the Closing.

 

(b) _Determination     of Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i) As     soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller proposed good
faith calculations of (A) the Net Working Capital, (B) the amount of Cash and
Cash Equivalents, (C) the amount  of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, (D)
the amount of Unpaid Seller Expenses and (E) the Purchase Price based thereon
(collectively, the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ "), in each case,
including reasonably detailed calculations of  the components thereof and
prepared in a manner consistent with the definitions thereof. Buyer agrees to
prepare the Proposed Closing Date Calculations in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and the definitions and other terms included in  this
Agreement.

 

(ii) (A)      If Seller does not give written notice of any dispute (a "
_Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within forty-five (45) days of
receiving the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, then Buyer and Seller agree
that the Proposed Closing Date  Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the
final Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for
purposes of determining the Actual Adjustment; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
in the event that Buyer does not provide any materials reasonably requested by
Seller (including any of the Group Companies' books and records or the working
papers of Buyer's accountants prepared in connection with  preparation of the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations) within three (3) days of request therefor
(or such shorter period as may remain in such forty-five (45)-day period),
such forty-five (45)-day period shall be extended by one (1) day for each 
additional day required for Buyer to fully respond to such request. Prior to
the end of such forty-five (45)-day period (or such longer period as may be
extended in accordance with this paragraph), Seller may accept the Proposed
Closing Date  Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to
Buyer, in which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such
notice is given. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may provide a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice on the basis  that it has not been provided with
adequate information to understand and evaluate the differences between the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, on the one hand, and Buyer's calculation
of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and components  thereof including
the Net Working Capital (and the related Net Working Capital Adjustment, if
any), the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, the amount of Closing Date
Funded Indebtedness and/or the amount of Unpaid Seller Expenses), on the
other  hand. If Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer
within such forty-five

 

 

-16-  

(45)-day period, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve the dispute during the 30-day period  commencing on the date Buyer
receives the Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Seller. Any item set forth in
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and not objected to in the Purchase
Price Dispute Notice shall be final and binding on the Parties  and shall not
be subject to court review or otherwise appealable, and the Parties shall
deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to Seller the Adjustment Escrow Amount less any amounts
still  being disputed by the Parties. If Seller and Buyer do not agree upon a
final resolution with respect to any disputed items within such thirty
(30)-day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be  submitted
immediately to the dispute resolution group of BDO USA, LLP in New York, New
York, or if BDO USA, LLP refuses such submission, the dispute resolution group
of a nationally-recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably agreed upon
by  Buyer and Seller (BDO USA, LLP or such agreed accounting firm, as
applicable, the " _Accounting Firm_ "), the determination of such Accounting
Firm being conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to
court review or otherwise  appealable. Any item not specifically submitted to
the Accounting Firm for resolution shall be deemed final and binding on the
Parties as set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice, in the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations (but only to the  extent such item is not set forth
in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice), or as otherwise resolved in writing by
Buyer and Seller. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed, and Buyer and
Seller shall (and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to)  use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm, to render a determination
(acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) of the applicable dispute
within forty-five (45) days after referral of the matter to such Accounting
Firm,  which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis therefor. In a potential dispute resolution
procedure pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ , all prior discussions related
thereto shall, unless otherwise  agreed by Seller and Buyer, be governed by
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and neither Party may discuss, use
or rely upon the other Party's conduct or statements during such dispute
resolution or in any communication with the Accounting  Firm. In connection
with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3(b)_ ,
Buyer and Seller agree to execute, if requested by the Accounting Firm, an
engagement letter in customary form that is reasonable satisfactory to  each
of Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , that in the event that either Buyer or
Seller refuses to execute such an engagement letter or otherwise fails to
cooperate with the other Party and the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
dispute  resolution procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3(b)_ (as
reasonably determined by the other Party), the other Party shall be permitted
to unilaterally engage the Accounting Firm to render a determination of the
applicable dispute in  accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 2.3(b)_ and the Accounting Firm shall be permitted to rely on any
such unilateral engagement to the same extent as if the Accounting Firm were
mutually engaged by Buyer and Seller, and  Buyer and Seller agree that in the
event of any such engagement, the determination of the Accounting Firm with
respect to such dispute shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and
shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable.

 

(B) Within     fifteen (15) days after the engagement of the Accounting
Firm, Seller and Buyer shall submit their respective positions with respect to
the items set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice in the form of  a
written report, a copy of which shall be delivered to the other Party upon
submission to the Accounting Firm, and no ex parte conferences, oral
examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other  form of evidence
gathering or hearings shall be conducted or allowed; _provided_ , that at the
Accounting

 

 

-17-  

Firm's request, or as mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer, Seller and Buyer
may meet with the  Accounting Firm so long as representatives of both Seller
and Buyer are present. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be instructed
to be based solely on the written  reports submitted to the Accounting Firm
by Seller and Buyer and oral submissions by Seller and Buyer at meetings held
in compliance with the prior sentence (i.e., not on independent review) and on
the definitions and other terms included in this  Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in resolving a disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value
to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item or less
than the smallest value for  such item, in each case, claimed by Buyer or
Seller in the written reports submitted to the Accounting Firm. In the absence
of manifest error by the Accounting Firm and Fraud, the Accounting Firm's
decision  with respect to the matters in dispute shall be final and binding
on the Parties and shall not be subject to court review or otherwise
appealable, and any Party may seek to enforce such decision in a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 

(C) The     terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm
shall be as agreed upon between Seller and Buyer, and any associated
engagement fees shall be initially borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer;
_provided_ , that the fees and  disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall
ultimately be allocated between Seller and Buyer in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm
that are unsuccessfully disputed by each such  Party (as finally determined
by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted. All other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting  Firm shall be
borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense. The Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any
objections thereto pursuant to this _Section     2.3_ and, as so revised,
such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each  case, for
all purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

 

(iii) Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to,
make their financial records, the Group Companies' books and records and the
working papers of Buyer's accountants prepared in connection with preparation
of the  Proposed Closing Date Calculations reasonably available to Seller and
its accountants and other representatives (and Seller and its accountants and
other representatives shall be permitted to make copies as they see reasonably
necessary) during  the review by Seller of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations. The Company shall further make available applicable personnel
employed by the Group Companies or Buyer after the Closing to answer any
questions that Seller may have during its  review of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations. Such access to financial records, books and records and
working papers, as well as applicable personnel, shall be during normal
business hours, and shall not (A) unreasonably interfere with the  normal
business operations of the Group Companies, (B) jeopardize attorney/client or
attorney work product privilege or (C) result in any Group Company breaching
any confidentiality obligations to third parties.

 

 

-18-  

(c) _Adjustment     to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If     the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then within three
(3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ , Buyer shall, or shall cause a
Group Company, to pay to Seller  an aggregate amount equal to such positive
amount by wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds.

 

(ii) If     the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three
(3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ , Buyer and Seller shall deliver
joint written instructions to  the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to deliver to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Funds an amount equal to the
absolute value of such negative amount.

 

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ (and concurrent
with the payments made or the instructions delivered pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)(i)_   or _2.3(c)(ii)_ , as applicable), Buyer and Seller shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Seller any Adjustment Escrow Funds not distributed to Buyer
pursuant to _Section  2.3(c)(ii)_.

 

(iv) For     the avoidance of doubt, recovery from the Adjustment Escrow
Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer and its
Affiliates for any negative Actual Adjustment and Seller shall not have any
liability or obligation under this _Section     2.3_ for any portion of
the Actual Adjustment in excess of the amount of the then-remaining Adjustment
Escrow Funds.

 

(v) Any     amounts which become payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)_
will constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes.

 

(d) _Accounting     Principles_. The Estimated Closing Statement, the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Actual Adjustment and the
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared and
calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group  Companies in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and the definitions and other terms included in
this Agreement, except that such statements, calculations and determinations
shall: (i) not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment  arising
out of or resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effects of any act, decision or
event  occurring on or after the Closing. Buyer shall not make any changes to
the assumptions underlying the Accounting Principles as further specifically
set forth in the Example Statement of Net Working Capital  (including levels
of reserves used by the Group Companies with respect thereto). In furtherance
of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Accounting Principles
are not intended to permit the introductions of different judgments, 
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies from those used by the Group
Companies in its preparation of the Example Statement of Net Working Capital.

 

 

-19-  

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and  withheld under applicable Tax Law; _provided_ ,
that the Person intending to deduct and withhold any such amounts shall notify
Seller in writing of its intention to deduct and withhold such amounts and the
reason therefore at least ten (10)  days prior to the Closing Date or the due
date of the applicable payment. To the extent that such timely notice is
provided to Seller and amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Buyer, such withheld  amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If any
withholding obligation (other than pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code) may
be  avoided by the applicable Person providing information or documentation
to Buyer, then Buyer shall request such information or documentation in
writing at least ten (10) days prior to the due date of the applicable payment
(which due date, in the  case of the payments pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ ,
shall be the Closing Date).

their duties and obligations under or with respect to each Company Employee

letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or, if applicable, is relying on
a favorable determination letter or similar letter received by the prototype

such determination letter that would cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption, and no assessment of any Taxes has been made or, to the Company's 
knowledge, is threatened against any Group Company, or any related trust of
any Company Employee Benefit Plan, on the basis of a failure of such
qualification or exemption. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(c)_ ,
neither the execution  and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent event) will (i) entitle any Person to any

benefits under or with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii)
trigger any acceleration of vesting or payment of benefits under or with

Benefit Plan.

acquires ownership or effective control of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
or ownership of a substantial portion of the their assets (within the meaning
of section 280G of the Code)): (i) constituting an  "excess parachute

Plan and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any Liability in

Plan. No Company Employee  Benefit Plan which is an Employee Welfare Benefit
Plan provides or promises post-retirement health or life benefits to current
employees or retirees of the Company beyond their retirement date or other
termination of service, except as required  by applicable Law. No Company
Employee

 

 

-26-  

Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare  arrangement" within the
meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

(e) All     contributions which are due under the terms of each Company
Employee Benefit Plan (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) have been timely made or paid by the due date
thereof and all contributions for  any period ending on or before the date of

other payments for all periods ending on or  before the Closing Date have
been (or prior to the Closing Date will be) paid with respect to each Company
Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(f) With     respect to the Company Employee Benefit Plans no event has
occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection
with which the Group Companies or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to any
material Liability (other than  for routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course of business) under the terms of the Company Employee Benefit
Plans or any applicable Law. None of the Company Employee Benefit Plans are
under investigation by the U.S. Internal Revenue  Service or U.S. Department
of Labor. No claim, action, suit or proceeding is pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course of  business)
and no fact exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding. No "prohibited transaction", as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred 
with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

action or proceeding pending or, to the Seller's actual knowledge, threatened

period under the  HSR Act (or any similar non-U.S. Laws) or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions

Agreement, then each of  Seller, Buyer and the Company shall make (or cause
to be made) as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with each
other, an appropriate response in compliance with the Second Request in order
to obtain expiration or termination of  the applicable waiting period before
the Outside Date; provided that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
be obligated to: (i) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale,  divestiture, license or
other disposition of any capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses

other Parties to review in advance any  proposed communication by it to any
Governmental Entity. No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting or
substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults  with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting or conversation. Each Party will provide the other Parties with
copies  of all correspondence, filings or communications between it or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such material may be redacted as necessary to (i) comply with contractual
arrangements, (ii) address legal privilege or confidentiality concerns and
(iii) comply with applicable Law.

only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the  recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In
addition, subject to applicable Law, the Parties shall  consult and cooperate
with each other in advance in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted
to any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement by or on behalf of any Party.

 

(f) Buyer     shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective ultimate parent entities not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by
merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by  any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive  agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity 
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys,  accountants or
other agents to take, any action to solicit, initiate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any
agreement with any Person (other than Buyer and/or its Affiliates, officers,

purchase of any of the Company's equity securities or any merger, sale of all,

representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and
other agents, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all 
existing discussions, negotiations and other communications with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any such Acquisition Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the
date of this  Agreement, Seller and the Company has provided information
related to the Group Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in
discussions with, other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition
Transaction and that such information,  access and discussions could
reasonably enable another Person to form a basis for an Acquisition
Transaction without any breach by Seller or the Company of this _Section 6.4_
, (ii) subject to clause (iii) below, Seller and the Company may  respond to
any unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating
that each of Seller and the Company

 

 

-51-  

is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is unable to provide any
information related to the Group Companies or entertain any  proposals or
offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition
Transaction for as long as this Agreement remains in effect, and (iii) Seller
shall promptly, and in any event no later than two (2) Business Days of 
Seller's or the Company's receipt of an unsolicited proposal regarding an
Acquisition Transaction, notify Buyer of such proposal made, including
reasonable details thereof.

 

Section 6.5 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of  this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not
permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact
any employee, interpreter, customer,  supplier, distributor or other material
business relation of Seller or any Group Company, regarding any Group Company,
its business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written (including by e-mail) consent of  Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , this _Section 6.5_ shall not limit Buyer (and its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates) from contacting any of its existing or
prospective customers, suppliers or business relations in  the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice unrelated to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer     agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of each
Group Company, as provided in each such Group Company's Governing Documents or
otherwise in effect as of the  Closing Date with respect to any matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect and that each Group Company will perform and
discharge such Group Company's obligations to provide  such indemnity and
exculpation after the Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Buyer
shall cause each Group Company to advance expenses in connection with  such
indemnification as provided in the each such Group Company's Governing
Documents or other applicable agreements. The indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of each Group Company's Governing
Documents shall not be  amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing
Date, were directors, officers,  employees or agents of the Group Companies,
unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior     to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to obtain a
"tail" policy providing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage,
for a period of six (6) years beginning on the Closing Date, for the benefit
of those Persons who are  covered by the Group Companies' directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing. Buyer shall cause the
Company to maintain in effect beginning on  the Closing Date and for a period
of six (6) years thereafter, without any lapses in coverage, such "tail"
policy. Such policy shall provide coverage that is at least equal to the
coverage provided under the Group Companies' current directors'  and
officers' liability insurance policies; _provided_ , that the Group Companies'
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to

 

 

-52-  

the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does not result in gaps
or lapses in coverage with respect to matters  occurring prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(c) The     directors, officers, employees and agents of the Group
Companies entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation
and insurance set forth in this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section     6.6_. This _Section 6.6_ shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Group Companies.

 

(d) If     Buyer, the Group Companies or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys  all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the Group Companies shall assume the  obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

Section 6.7 _Continuing Insurance Coverage_. In addition to the "tail" policy
referenced in _Section 6.6(b)_ , prior to or contemporaneously with the
Closing, Seller shall use its  reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
to (a) obtain "tail" policies for the insurance policies set forth in
_Schedule 6.7_ that cover the Group Companies for a period of six (6) years
beginning on the Closing Date with respect to  matters occurring prior to the
Closing, and (b) renew the Company's existing cyber insurance policy with
Lloyd's, which policy shall include an aggregate coverage limit of at least
$10,000,000.00 and no material changes to the terms and  conditions of the
existing policy (including self-insured retentions and any sublimits) (the
policies referenced in clauses (a) and (b), each a " _Buyer Requested
Insurance Policy_ "), provided that the costs of such Buyer Requested
Insurance  Policies shall be deemed post-Closing expenses of the Company.
Such provisions shall provide coverage that is at least equal to the coverage
provided under the Group Companies' corresponding policy of insurance;
_provided_ , that  notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the
obtaining of any such Buyer Requested Insurance Policy shall not be a
condition to Closing.

 

Section 6.8 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to, until the seventh
(7th) year anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and
other documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in existence
on the Closing  Date and, if necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement (including for any Tax matter contemplated by _Section 6.10_
) or the defense or prosecution of any suit, claim, action or proceeding, make
the same available  for inspection and copying by the other Party (at such
Party's expense) during normal business hours upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable notice, _provided_ that all books, records and other documents made
available after the Closing  pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall be in
accordance with confidentiality agreements that the Party making available
reasonably requests, including such agreements as would enable the Parties to
review such information without jeopardizing  any attorney-client or other
legal privilege and without contravening any applicable Laws or binding
agreements. No such books, records or documents shall be destroyed until after
the seventh (7th) year anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer or the Group
Companies without first advising Seller in writing and giving Seller a
reasonable

 

 

-53-  

opportunity to obtain possession thereof, subject to the confidentiality
obligations referenced in the immediately preceding  sentence.

 

Section 6.9 _No Public Disclosure_. No press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, shall  be issued or made by any Party (nor
will any Party permit any of its advisors or Affiliates to do any thereof)
without the prior written approval of Seller and Buyer, (a) unless, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel, such communication is  required by applicable
Law, in which case Seller and Buyer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such press release, announcement or communication
prior to its issuance, distribution or publication, (b)  notwithstanding
clause (a) above, except for a press release or public announcement or filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to the extent necessary for Buyer
or its Affiliates to comply with applicable securities Laws or New York 
Stock Exchange rules, which Buyer is authorized to issue in its sole
reasonable discretion, (c) except for disclosure made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or the  transactions contemplated thereby, (d) except for press
releases or other public announcements by Buyer or its Affiliates that do not
include the amount of consideration involved hereunder (or any other financial
metric such as proceeds, rate of  return or multiples of money) or the name
of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Group Companies) and (e)
except for press releases or other public announcements by Seller or its
Affiliates that do not include the amount of  consideration involved
hereunder (or any other financial metric such as proceeds, rate of return or
multiples of money) or the name of Buyer or its Affiliates (other than the
Group Companies). Nothing herein shall prevent any Party or any  Affiliate
thereof which is a private equity or other investment fund from making
customary disclosures, including the key economic terms of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and the return realized as a result thereof, to
its  current or prospective investors. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Kinderhook and its Affiliates and
representatives may provide general information about the subject matter of
this Agreement and the Group  Companies (including its and their performance
and improvements) in connection with Kinderhook's or its Affiliates' fund
raising, marketing, informational or reporting activities. Following the
Closing, Kinderhook and its Affiliates may use and  reference the names of
each Group Company and the associated marks and logos for the purpose of
describing the historical relationship of the Group Companies with Kinderhook
and its Affiliates (including on their respective web sites) and the  Company
hereby grants (and agrees to cause each Group Company to grant) to Kinderhook
and its Affiliates a royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use each
Group Company's names and the associated marks and logos only for such
purpose.

 

Section 6.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax     Returns_. Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Income Tax Returns of the Group Companies for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due after the Closing Date in a manner
consistent with the past  practice of the Group Companies, except as
otherwise required by Law. All Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the maximum extent permitted by
Law and shall be claimed as current deductions on the  Income Tax Returns of
the Group Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date
to the maximum extent permitted by Law. Buyer shall deliver to Seller, for its
review and comment, such Income Tax Returns at least thirty

 

 

-54-  

(30) days prior to the due date for filing such Income Tax Return and shall
accept any reasonable comments to such Income Tax  Returns to the extent (i)
Buyer determines in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith that
such comments reflect positions that are more likely than not to be upheld if
challenged by the applicable taxing authority, and (ii) such comments  are
received at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such
Income Tax Returns.

 

(b) _Straddle     Period Returns_. Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Group Companies for any
Straddle Periods (the " _Straddle Period Returns_ "). Each such Straddle
Period Return shall be prepared in  a manner consistent with the Group
Companies' past practices except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Buyer shall submit each such Straddle Period Return to Seller at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such  Straddle Period
Return (taking into account any valid extensions of time to file) and Seller
shall have the right to review and comment on such Straddle Period Return and
Buyer shall reflect such comments from Seller on such Straddle Period  Return
to the extent (i) such comments are consistent with the standard set forth in
the previous sentence and Buyer determines in its reasonable discretion
exercised in good faith that such comments reflect positions that are more
likely than  not to be upheld if challenged by the applicable taxing
authority, and (ii) such comments are received at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Period Return.

 

(c) _Tax     Assets_.

 

(i) Seller     shall be entitled to the amount of any Tax refunds (and any
interest with respect thereto) that are received by Buyer, any Group Company
(or any of their respective Affiliates) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
excluding (A) any Tax refunds or  credits to the extent included in the final
computation of Accrued Income Taxes or (B) any carryback of a net operating
loss or other Tax attribute and (C) any Tax refunds attributable to or
consisting of credits contemplated by Section 41 of the  Code or
corresponding provisions of state and local law (any such Tax refunds, " _Tax
Refunds_ "), _provided_ that any such Tax Refunds shall be net of any
additional Taxes or expenses incurred by Buyer, any Group Company (or any of 
their respective Affiliates) in connection with a Tax Refunds.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding     anything to the contrary in _Section 6.10(a)_ ,
at Seller's expense, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to,
promptly execute such documents, take reasonable additional actions as
specifically requested by Seller and otherwise  reasonably cooperate as may
be necessary for Buyer, the Group Companies and any of their Affiliates to
perfect their rights in and obtain all Tax Refunds, including for the
avoidance of doubt, filing amended Income Tax Returns with respect to Tax 
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date provided such amended Tax
Returns reflect positions that are more likely than not to be upheld if
challenged by the applicable taxing authority are delivered to Buyer for
review least thirty (30)  days prior to the due date for filing.

 

(iii) For U.S. federal and applicable state and local Income Tax purposes, the
Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to this _Section 6.10(c)_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable
Tax  Law.

 

 

-55-  

(d) _Disputes_.      Any dispute as to any substantive Tax matter covered
by this _Section 6.10_ shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_. If any dispute with respect to a
Tax Return (including with  respect to the computation of any Tax Refund) is
not resolved prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, such Tax Return
shall be filed in the manner which the Party responsible for preparing such
Tax Return under this Agreement deems  correct, but the content of such Tax
Return shall not prejudice, control or otherwise resolve the dispute hereunder
and the liability, if any, of either Party under this Agreement, and the
Parties shall amend the applicable Tax Return to reflect  the final
determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the items in dispute.

 

(e) _Straddle     Period Allocation_. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Tax (or Tax refund) imposed with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Tax (or Tax refund) that is allocable to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on  the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of
any Taxes other than Income Taxes, Taxes based on receipts, sales or payments
and other Taxes that are transaction based, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Straddle Period  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period prior to and ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any  Income Taxes and Taxes
based on receipts, sales or payments and other Taxes that are transaction
based (or Income Tax refunds), be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date,  provided
that all permitted allowances, credits, exemptions and deductions that are
normally computed on the basis of an entire year period (such as depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be
allocated  between the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period and the
post-Closing portion of the Straddle Period in proportion to the number of
days in each such period.

 

(f) _Pre-Closing     Tax Matters_. Without the prior written consent of
Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer and
its Affiliates shall not, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not permit the
Group Companies to, take any of the  following actions to the extent such
action would adversely affect Seller by reason of such action reducing the
amount of any Tax Refund otherwise payable to Seller pursuant to _Section
6.10(a)_ : (i) amend or otherwise modify any Income Tax  Return relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.10(c)_ );
or (ii) make or change any Income Tax election or accounting method or
practice with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any  Pre-Closing
Tax Period; provided, however, that any failure by Seller to consent to any
such action shall be deemed unreasonable if Buyer determines in its reasonable
discretion exercised in good faith that the proposed action reflects one or 
more positions that are more likely than not to be upheld if challenged by the
applicable taxing authority.

 

(g) _Closing     Tax Period_. The Parties hereto shall, to the extent
permitted or required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last
day of the taxable period of the Group Companies for all Tax purposes, and
Buyer shall cause the Group  Companies to join Buyer's "consolidated group"
(as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(h)) effective on the day
after the Closing Date.

 

(h) _FIRPTA     Certificate_. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall
deliver a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 to Buyer; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding

 

 

-56-  

anything contained in this Agreement, the delivery of such certificate shall
not be a condition to Closing and Buyer's sole right  if the Company fails to
provide such certificate shall be to make an appropriate withholding under
Section 1445 of the Code.

 

(i) _Intermediary     Transaction Tax Shelter_. Buyer shall not take any
action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the Company subsequent
to the Closing that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to constitute part of a  transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described
in IRS Notice 2001-16 and/or IRS Notice 2008-111.

 

(j) _Costa     Rica Tax Items_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall engage the Approved CR
Accounting Firm to prepare and file the Costa Rica Tax Returns (provided, for
the avoidance of doubt, that no such  Costa Rica Tax Return shall be filed
prior to the Closing). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer and the Approved CR Accounting Firm in the preparation of such
Costa Rica Tax Returns. Buyer shall deliver to Seller,  for Seller's review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), a draft of each such Costa Rica Tax Return as soon as is
reasonably practicable following the Closing (and in any event no later than 
forty five (45) days prior to Costa Rica Filing Deadline) and Buyer shall
accept any reasonable comments to such Costa Rica Tax Returns to the extent
that (A) such comments are received at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Costa Rica Filing  Deadline and (B) Buyer determines in its reasonable
discretion exercised in good faith that such comments reflect positions that
are more likely than not to be upheld if challenged by the applicable taxing
authority. Buyer shall file each such  Costa Rica Tax Return promptly
following approval by Seller and, in any event, no later than the Costa Rica
Filing Deadline. Buyer shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Approved CR Accounting Firm relating to the preparation and  filing of the
Costa Rica Tax Returns; _provided_ that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for up to
$150,000 (in the aggregate) of such fees and expenses (the " _Costa Rica
Expense Reimbursement_ ") upon presentation to Seller of a written  invoice
from the Approved CR Accounting Firm, which shall be released from the Costa
Rica Escrow Funds at Buyer's election.

 

(k) _Release     of Costa Rica Escrow Funds_.

 

(i) Within     three (3) Business Days after the date on which Buyer files
any Costa Rica Tax Return pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.10(j)_
, Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow  Agent to deliver to Buyer from the Costa Rica
Escrow Funds an amount equal to the Costa Rica Tax Amount shown on such Costa
Rica Tax Return.

 

(ii) Within     three (3) Business Days after the date on which Buyer
presents a written invoice for any Costa Rica Expense Reimbursement, at
Buyer's election, Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow  Agent to deliver to Buyer from the
Costa Rica Escrow Funds an amount equal to such Costa Rica Expense
Reimbursement.

 

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days after the earlier of (A) the date on
which all Costa Rica Tax Returns have been filed by Buyer pursuant to and in
accordance with

 

 

-57-  

_Section 6.10(j)_ (as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion) and
concurrent with the instructions delivered pursuant to  _Section 6.10(k)(i)_
with respect to the last Costa Rica Tax Return filed by Buyer and (B) the
Costa Rica Filing Deadline, Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to 
Seller from the Costa Rica Escrow Funds any Costa Rica Escrow Funds not
distributed to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.10(j)_.

 

(iv) For     the avoidance of doubt, recovery from the Costa Rica Escrow
Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer and its
Affiliates for any Costa Rica Tax Liabilities and Seller shall not have any
liability or obligation under this  Agreement or otherwise for any portion of
any Costa Rica Tax Liabilities in excess of the amount of the then-remaining
Costa Rica Escrow Funds.

 

Section 6.11 _Release of Seller_. Effective upon Closing, Buyer, on behalf of
itself, the Company and the Group Companies, and its and their respective
successors and assigns,  irrevocably and unconditionally waives, releases and
forever discharges Seller and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
successors and assigns (the " _Seller Released Parties_ ") from any and all
rights, claims, debts, causes of  action, obligations and liabilities or
losses of any nature or kind, whether direct or indirect, known or unknown,
matured or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated or due
or to become due, and whether arising in Law, in  equity or otherwise, based
upon facts, circumstances or occurrences existing on or prior to Closing;
provided, however, that the foregoing release does not cover (and, for
purposes of clarity, such matters are not hereby released or discharged)  (i)
any claims or rights arising under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document,
or (ii) any claims against a Person based on Fraud.

 

Section 6.12 _Release of Group Companies_.

 

(a) Effective     upon Closing, Seller does hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, releases and forever discharges the Group Companies
and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns
(the " _Buyer Released Parties_ "), from  any and all rights, claims, debts,
causes of action, obligations and liabilities or losses of any nature or kind,
whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
matured or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or  unliquidated or
due or to become due, and whether arising in Law, in equity or otherwise that
Seller may now or henceforth have against the Buyer Released Parties from
whatever cause, action, omission, or other matter or circumstance, from the 
beginning of time to and through the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing release does not cover (and, for purposes of clarity, such
matters are not hereby released or discharged) (i) any claims or rights
arising under  this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or, in the case of
any Buyer Released Party that is a director, officer or employee of a Group
Company and is also a member or officer of Seller, under the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Seller or  any agreement entered into in connection
therewith (including any Grant Agreement) or (ii) any claims against a Person
based on Fraud.

 

(b) It     is each of Buyer's and Seller's intention that _Section 6.11_
and _Section 6.12(a)_ shall be effective as a full and final accord and
satisfactory release of each and every matter specifically or generally
referred to in such  sections. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that it
is aware that it may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition or

 

 

-58-  

different from those it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the
matters released in _Section 6.11_ and _Section     6.12(a)_.
Nevertheless, it is the intention of each of Buyer and Seller to fully,
finally and forever settle and release all such matters, and all claims
relative thereto, which do now exist, may exist, or heretofore have existed.
In  furtherance of such intention, each of _Section 6.11_ and _Section
6.12(a)_ shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete general release
of all such matters, notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any
additional or  different claims or facts relative thereto. Each of Buyer and
Seller acknowledges that the applicable laws of many states provide
substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT
THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES  NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR
HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR
HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR
RELEASED PARTY." Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges  that such provisions
are designed to protect a party from waiving claims which it does not know
exist or may exist. Nonetheless, each of Buyer and Seller agrees that,
effective as of the Closing, it shall be deemed to waive any such provision.

 

(c) Buyer     expressly covenants not to (i) sue the Seller Released
Parties to enforce any charge, claim or cause of action released pursuant to
_Section 6.11_ , (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in any such
proceeding, or (iii) encourage, assist  and/or solicit any third party to
institute any such proceeding. Seller expressly covenants not to (i) sue the
Buyer Released Parties to enforce any charge, claim or cause of action
released pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_ , (ii) participate,  assist, or
cooperate in any such proceeding, or (iii) encourage, assist and/or solicit
any third party to institute any such proceeding. This covenant not to bring
or maintain any action in law or equity shall be subject to specific
enforcement.

 

Section 6.13 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) As     a condition to its willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Buyer has required that Seller agree to the following protective covenants:

 

(i) Seller     acknowledges that Buyer would not close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless Seller, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, agrees to the restrictions set forth herein. Accordingly, Seller
expressly acknowledges that it is  agreeing to these restrictions to induce
Buyer to carry out the terms of this Agreement.

 

(ii) Seller     recognizes that Buyer would be irreparably damaged, and
Buyer's substantial investment in the businesses of the Group Companies
materially impaired, if Seller or its Affiliates were to engage in an activity
that violates these restrictions.   Accordingly, Seller expressly
acknowledges that it is voluntarily agreeing to these restrictions and that
the terms and conditions of these restrictions are fair and reasonable to
Seller and its Affiliates in all respects.

 

(iii) Seller will derive a substantial and direct benefit from Buyer's payment
of the Purchase Price, and as a material inducement to Buyer entering into
this Agreement, has agreed, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, to
enter into  these restrictions in order to protect the value of the
businesses acquired by Buyer hereunder (including the goodwill

 

 

-59-  

inherent in such businesses). Seller acknowledges that its obligations herein
are reasonable in the context of this Agreement,  the nature and scope of the
businesses of the Group Companies and the competitive injuries likely to be
sustained by Buyer if Seller or its Affiliates violate such obligations.
Sellers further acknowledges that this Agreement is made in  consideration
of, and is adequately supported by the agreement of Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and by other consideration, which Seller
acknowledges constitutes good, valuable and sufficient consideration.

 

(iv) Neither     Seller nor its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
either separately or in conjunction with any other Person or through any other
Person, during the Restricted Period, (A) solicit or induce for employment any
employee or individual  independent contractor or consultant of a Group
Company who was also employed or engaged by a Group Company as of the Closing
Date and/or solicit or induce any such employee or individual independent
contractor or consultant to leave the employ  of a Group Company or cease
providing services to a Group Company; or (B) cause such Persons to terminate
or refrain from renewing or extending his, her or its employment relationship
or services relationship with a Group Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not restrict the soliciting or hiring of employees
employed by any Group Company through a general advertisement or general
solicitation not directed or targeted at employees of the Group Companies 
(including through the use of search firms).

 

(v) Neither     Seller nor its Affiliates will, at any time during the
Restricted Period, unless compelled by Law, knowingly and intentionally
disparage or defame Buyer or its Affiliates, the members of their governing
boards, their officers or employees, in  each case, in their capacities as
such. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates will, at any time during the Restricted
Period, unless compelled by Law, knowingly and intentionally disparage or
defame Seller or its Affiliates, the members of their  governing boards,
their officers or employees, in each case, in their capacities as such.
Nothing in this _Section 6.13_ shall be violated by truthful statements in
response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or 
administrative or arbitral proceedings (including depositions in connection
with such proceedings).

 

(vi)   Seller acknowledges and agrees that irreparably injury will result to
Buyer in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 6.13_
and that Buyer will not have an adequate remedy at law with respect thereto.
Accordingly,  in the event of a breach of the covenants contained herein, and
in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy Buyer may have, Buyer shall
be entitled to seek the entry of a preliminary injunction or permanent
injunction (including, without  limitation, specific performance) by a court
of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation or breach thereof,
without proof of any actual damages that have been or may be caused by such
breach and without the necessity of posting bond.

 

(vii) In the event Seller or its Affiliates violate any covenant in this
_Section 6.13_ , the running of the time period of such provisions so violated
shall be automatically suspended upon the date of such violation and shall
resume on  the date such violation ceases.

 

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this _Section 6.13_ shall not
restrict action by any portfolio company of Kinderhook, or any portfolio
company of any

 

 

-60-  

investment fund managed, advised or controlled by, or affiliated with,
Kinderhook, as long as neither Kinderhook nor any  investment fund managed,
advised or controlled by, or affiliated with, Kinderhook, or its or their
respective general partners, investment managers and/or investment advisors
actively directs, causes, assists or participates in such actions in 
violation of this _Section 6.13_.

 

(ix) Any     covenant contained in this _Section 6.13_ that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining  covenants of this _Section 6.13_ but shall be
interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior     to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates as is reasonably requested
by Buyer in connection with any debt financing from one or more debt financing
sources that commit to provide  or arrange or otherwise enter into agreements
to provide or arrange any part of the debt financing with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that nothing contained
in this _Section 6.14(a)_ shall require such  cooperation to the extent it
would (i) require Seller or any Group Company or any of their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, equityholders, agents, consultants,
advisors or other representatives to enter into or approve any  agreement or
arrangement or deliver any document or instrument, or incur any liability or
give any indemnities, other than, in the case of the Group Companies only,
those that are not effective until, or are contingent upon, the closing of
the  transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) violate or conflict with the
Governing Documents of the Group Companies, (iii) violate or constitute a
breach or default under, or conflict with, or result in the termination of or
a termination right under,  any material contract of any of the Group
Companies, (iv) violate or conflict with any applicable law, rule, regulation
or order or decree, or (v) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Group Companies.

 

(b) Buyer     shall reimburse Seller and the Group Companies, as
applicable, for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller, any
Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates (including those of their
accountants, consultants, legal counsel,  agents and other representatives)
in connection with the cooperation required by this _Section 6.14_.

 

(c) Buyer     and Seller hereby consent to the use of the Group Companies'
businesses' logos in connection with any debt financing, _provided_ that such
logos shall be used in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm, disparage or  otherwise adversely affect Buyer or Seller.

 

(d) Buyer     shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, the Group
Companies, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and shall hold
each of them harmless from,  any and all actual losses, damages, penalties,
awards, fines, costs (including court costs and investigative and remedial
costs), amounts paid in settlement, liabilities, obligations, Taxes, Liens,
fees and expenses (including those of their  accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents and other

 

 

-61-  

representatives) suffered or incurred, arising out of or resulting from any
action taken by Seller or any Group Company, pursuant  to this _Section 6.14_
or in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing or any information
utilized in connection therewith, and this indemnification, except to the
extent arising from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or  bad faith of
any Seller Indemnified Parties.

 

Section 6.15 _Section 280G._ No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller and/or any applicable Group Company shall solicit
approval by their equityholders, to  the extent required by, and in a manner
that complies with, Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, of the right of any "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive and  retain any payment or
benefits to be made or deemed made by Seller or any Group Company or Buyer or
any of their Affiliates that could, separately or in the aggregate, in the
absence of such approval by equityholders, cause such total payments  and/or
benefits to constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which
determination shall be made by Seller and shall be subject to review and
comment by  Buyer). Prior to seeking such equityholder approval, Seller shall
obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined under Section 280G(c)
of the Code) with a right to any potential "parachute payment" (as defined
under Section 280G(b)(2) of  the Code) a waiver of the right to the portion
of payments or benefits that would cause such total payments and/or benefits
to constitute "parachute payments" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code) (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ")  such that unless such payment and/or
benefit to that disqualified individual is approved before the Closing Date by
equityholders in a manner described in Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, no such
payment and/or benefit will be made or provided or  retained. Within a
reasonable period of time (but not less than three (3) days) prior to
soliciting such waivers, Seller will provide a draft of such waivers and such
equityholder vote solicitation materials (together with any calculations and 
supporting documentation including Forms W-2/1099 and Schedule K-1 for
calendar years 2015 through 2019 for the disqualified individuals along with
any contract, arrangement, agreement or plan that is providing the putative
parachute payments) to  Buyer for Buyer's review and comment, and Seller will
consider and incorporate any reasonable comments from Buyer relating thereto.
To the extent that any of the Waived 280G Benefits are not timely approved by
the equityholders of Seller or any  applicable Group Company as contemplated
above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided in any manner
and to the extent necessary each affected disqualified individual shall
promptly repay to the applicable payor any Waived 280G  Benefits that were
previously provided to the disqualified individual. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that any contract, arrangement, agreement or plan is
entered into by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates, and a disqualified 
individual in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
before the Closing Date (the " _Buyer Arrangements_ "), Buyer shall provide a
copy of such contract, arrangement, agreement or plan to the Seller at least
five (5)  days before the solicitation of the Code 280G equityholder vote and
shall cooperate with Seller in good faith in order to calculate or determine
the value (for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or
benefits granted or  contemplated therein, which may be paid or granted in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that could
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.

this Agreement together with all Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as the same
may from time to time be amended,  modified, supplemented or restated in
accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor  its respective counsel,
shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of construing or
enforcing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be
construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or  against
any Party, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. An item shall be considered "made available" to Buyer, to the
extent such  phrase appears in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ , only if such item
has been posted by the Company or its representatives in the electronic
documentation site hosted by Donnelley Financial Solutions on behalf of the
Company at least two  (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof. Unless
otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: (i)

any particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause
contained in this Agreement; (ii) masculine gender shall also include the

in this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any Schedule referenced by a
particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other section in this  Agreement if the relevance of
such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any 
Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower
amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of
any such item in  any dispute or controversy as to

 

 

-69-

Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this  Agreement.

inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in  _Section 6.6_ _Section 6.12_ , _Section

intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever  under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any term  or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions  contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties shall
negotiate  in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest  extent possible.

this Agreement (other than compliance by the Company of any of its covenants
or agreements contained herein which are to be performed after the Closing).

 

(b) Any     agreement on the part of any Party to any such waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. Any waiver of any term

 

 

-70-  

or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or  a waiver of any other
term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of or delay by any Party to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights; _provided_ , that time is of the essence with respect to each  and
every provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall  constitute one and the same agreement.

"known by the Company" and any  derivations thereof or phrases having similar
import thereto shall mean as of the applicable date, (a) the actual knowledge
of David Fetterolf, Maureen Huber, Kathryn Jackson and Chris Downing (the "
_Knowledge Parties_ ") and (b) the  knowledge that any of the Knowledge
Parties would have obtained after making reasonable inquiry with respect to
the particular matter in question.

 

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand,
action, or cause of action  (a) arising under this Agreement or (b) in any
way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in
respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each
case, whether now existing or hereafter  arising, and whether in contract,
tort, equity, or otherwise. Each Party hereby agrees and consents that any
such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be decided by court trial
without a jury and that the Parties may file an original  counterpart of a
copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of
the Parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

 

Section 10.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of  Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such  action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and (c) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient
forum  to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Party
with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint
or any other process  that might be served in any action or proceeding may be
made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party
to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section  10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.15_ ,
however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any action or proceeding so  brought shall be conclusive and may
be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 10.16 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The     Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such  actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article 9_ , Seller and Buyer  shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
Seller  or Buyer are entitled at Law or in equity.

 

(b) Each     of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at Law or  (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or 
injunction.

 

(c) To     the extent any Party brings an action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement), the  Outside Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the tenth Business Day following the final resolution of such
action and (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action.

 

Section 10.17 _Waivers_. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted as
legal counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates and the Group Companies
prior to the Closing, and that  Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal
counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates after the Closing, each of
Buyer, and each Group Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause  its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Seller and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Group Companies or the
transactions  contemplated herein (including in respect of litigation). In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between
Seller, its Affiliates, the Group Companies and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the
course of the negotiation,  documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not any of
the Group Companies). Accordingly, Buyer agrees that  following the Closing
neither it, the Group Companies nor their Affiliates shall have access to any
such communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to such
engagement with Seller and certain of its Affiliates, and/or the  Group
Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after
the Closing, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (and not any of the Group
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such  engagement, and no Group Company shall be a holder thereof,
(ii) to the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates
(and not any of

 

 

-72-  

the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Kirkland and
Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or  disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and
any of the Group Companies or otherwise.

 

Section 10.18 _Debt Financing Sources_. Seller and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or equityholders
shall not have any rights or claims  against any of the commercial banks,
investment banks or other financial institutions providing financing to Buyer
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
arrangers, administrative agents, collateral agents or  trustees involved in
such financing, and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, advisors, agents and representatives (each a " _Debt
Financing Party_ ") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments of
such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether at  law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt
Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to the Seller, its Affiliates or their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners,  managers, members or equityholders
for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including any dispute  arising out of or
relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any claims or causes of action
brought against any Debt Financing Party in its capacity as such will not be 
brought in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts, in each
case, located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York and
shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York and the parties hereto
will not  support any claim or cause of action brought against any Debt
Financing Party outside of the federal and New York State courts, in each
case, located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York. Each
party hereto irrevocably waives  any and all right to trial by jury in any
legal proceeding involving any Debt Financing Party arising out of or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. It is further
agreed that the Debt Financing Parties are intended  third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of, this _Section
10.18_ (and this _Section 10.18_ shall not be amended without the prior
written consent of the Debt Financing Parties).

 

Section 10.19 ___Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement  or the Ancillary Documents, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or as an  inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents), may be made only against the entities
that are expressly identified as Parties and thereto. No Person who is not a
named party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents,  including (a) any
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, equityholders (including stockholders and optionholders), Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement or 
the other Ancillary Documents, and (b) any Debt Financing Party, any affiliate
of a Debt Financing Party and any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, equityholders (including stockholders and optionholders),
Affiliate,  agent, attorney or representative of the foregoing (" _Non-Party_

 

 

-73-  

_Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that  seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or
liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or for any claim  based
on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other Ancillary
Document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof or
thereof; and each Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against  any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are
expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.19_ shall in no way
limit Buyer's recourse against  any Person in the case of Fraud.
