public announcement shall occur no later than the first Business Day

cause Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted by this Agreement, the "OFFER") to purchase all of the shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at a price of U.S. $35.00 per
share, net to the seller in cash (such price, or such higher price per share
of Company Common Stock as may be paid in the Offer, being referred to herein
as the "OFFER PRICE"). The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and
pay for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject only to the condition that there shall be validly tendered (other
than by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred) in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration date of the
Offer and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent and/or
Purchaser, represents at least a majority of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect to the
conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other rights
to acquire, and securities exercisable or convertible into, Company Common
Stock, whether or not exercised or converted at the time of determination)
(the "MINIMUM CONDITION") and to the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser as
permitted hereunder of the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO
PURCHASE") and the related letter of transmittal, each in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, containing the terms set forth in
this Agreement and the conditions set forth in Annex I. Parent and Purchaser
agree that the Offer to Purchase will state at least in the summary term
sheet and in appropriate places in the Offer to Purchase that "Purchaser\'s
obligation to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Offer is not
conditioned on any financing arrangements or subject to any financing
condition." Without limiting the foregoing, effective upon Consummation of
the Offer, the holder of such Company Common Stock will sell and assign to
Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all of the shares of
Company Common Stock tendered (including, but not limited to, such holder\'s
right to any and all dividends and distributions, if any, with a record date
before, and a payment date after, the scheduled or extended expiration
date).   Purchaser expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with
the Exchange Act, to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, which consent must be
expressly authorized by the board of directors of the Company (the
"COMPANY\'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS"), (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived
or    8    changed and (ii) no change may be made that changes the form
of consideration to be paid, decreases the Offer Price, decreases the number
of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, adds to or modifies
any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I, makes any other
change in the terms of the Offer that is materially adverse to the holders of
the Company Common Stock or (except as provided in the next sentence) changes
the expiration date of the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, extend the expiration date of the
Offer beyond the Initial Expiration Date, (i) if, immediately before the
scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to
the Offer shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived,
until such conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii) for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable Law or
(iii) for up to 10 additional business days in increments of not more than
two business days each (but in no event beyond the Termination Date), if,
immediately prior to the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer,
the Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
constitutes more than 80% and less than 90% of the outstanding Company Common
Stock, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of
such expiration date of the Offer; provided, that in the case of any
extension under clause (iii), Parent or Purchaser may not thereafter assert
the failure of any of the conditions provided for in clause (b)(ii) of Annex
I or, for purposes of clause (b)(iii) or (c) of Annex I, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a material breach of a representation or warranty, in each
such case, by reason of an event other than a knowing, intentional breach of
a covenant by the Company occurring after the initial extension under clause
(iii). In addition, Purchaser shall at the request of the Company extend the
Offer for a period of time sufficient to provide the applicable Cure Period
to the Company in the event of a breach by the Company of a representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of the Company under this Agreement
which breach, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is capable of being cured
during the applicable Cure Period, provided that, at the time of the then
scheduled expiration of the Offer, all other conditions to the Offer have
been satisfied or waived; and provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be
required to extend the Offer for any Cure Period if the Company shall fail to
give to Parent notice of its Knowledge of any such breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement within four Business Days of
its receipt of such Knowledge. For purposes of this Agreement, "CURE PERIOD"
shall mean thirty days from the date on which the Company has Knowledge of a
breach by the Company of a representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement under this Agreement, provided that in the event that the Company
first has Knowledge of a breach by the Company of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement under this Agreement after the Initial Expiration
Date, the Cure Period with respect to such breach shall not extend beyond the
then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer; and "INITIAL EXPIRATION DATE"
shall mean 12:00 midnight Eastern time on the date that is the twentieth
Business Day from the commencement date of the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act.   If any of the conditions to the Offer (other
than those set forth in clause (c) of Annex I) is not satisfied or waived on
any scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer, if such condition or
conditions could reasonably be expected to be satisfied, from time to time
until such conditions are satisfied or waived; provided, that Purchaser shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the
Termination Date or (y) in the event that it has become publicly known that
any Takeover Proposal or amended Takeover Proposal has been made, the
expiration    9    of the applicable Rejection Period therefor without
such Takeover Proposal or amended Takeover Proposal being publicly rejected
by the Company at or prior to the time of such expiration. For the purposes
of this Agreement, "REJECTION PERIOD" shall mean (i) with respect to any
Takeover Proposal, ten Business Days after the earlier of the time of receipt
by the Company of such Takeover Proposal or such time as the Takeover
Proposal has become publicly known; (ii) with respect to an amendment to such
Takeover Proposal, two Business Days after the earlier of the time of receipt
of such amended Takeover Proposal or such time as the amended Takeover
Proposal has become publicly known; and (iii) with respect to any subsequent
amendment to such Takeover Proposal (a "SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT"), twenty-four
hours after the earlier of the time of receipt of such subsequently amended
Takeover Proposal or such time as the subsequently amended Takeover Proposal
has become publicly known; provided that any Takeover Proposal made by any
Person, any Affiliate of such Person, or group of Persons or their respective
Affiliates shall not be deemed to be a new Takeover Proposal if such Person,
Affiliate of such Person or member of a group with such Person or their
respective Affiliates previously has made a Takeover Proposal. Subject to the
foregoing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay
for, as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer (or as
required by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act), all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. In addition,
if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied but Company Common Stock tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitutes less than 90% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock, without the consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall have the right, after it has accepted and paid for all of the
Company Common Stock tendered in the initial offer period, to provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) for up to 20 Business Days after Purchaser\'s acceptance for
payment of the shares of Company Common Stock then tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. During any such subsequent offering period, Purchaser
shall immediately accept for payment and promptly pay for all shares of
Company Common Stock as they are tendered pursuant to the Offer in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.   (b) No later than the first
Business Day following execution of this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall issue a joint press release with
the Company (the "JOINT PRESS RELEASE") regarding this Agreement and its
intent to make the Offer and shall file with the SEC the Joint Press Release,
under cover of Schedule TO, indicating on the front of such Schedule TO that
such filing contains pre-commencement communications.   (c) As soon as
practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits
thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO will
include or incorporate by reference as exhibits the Offer to Purchase and
forms of the letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and all other
ancillary documents (collectively, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Parent and Purchaser will take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company each
agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the   
10    Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws including
applicable SEC rules and regulations thereunder. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and the Offer Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In conducting
the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law. Purchaser
and Parent also agree to provide the Company and its counsel in writing with
any comments Purchaser, Parent or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after the receipt of such comments and shall consult with and provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
response of Purchaser to such comments prior to responding.   SECTION 2.2
COMPANY ACTION.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and represents that the Company\'s Board of Directors, at a meeting
duly called and held, has, by the unanimous vote of all directors present,
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to the Company\'s shareholders
and are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with
the requirements of the PRGCL and has also taken such action as is necessary
to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transaction Support
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby the
provisions of Article TENTH of the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation
and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by its shareholders. The Company further represents that UBS Warburg,
L.L.C. ("UBS WARBURG") has delivered to the Company\'s Board of Directors its
oral opinion (to be promptly confirmed in writing) that the consideration to
be paid in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) from a
financial point of view. The Company has not been advised by any of its
directors or executive officers who own shares of Company Common Stock that
such director or executive officer does not intend to tender his or her
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. In connection with the
Offer, the Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to,
promptly furnish Parent with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists in the
Company\'s possession or control of securities positions of shares of Company
Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case as of a recent date,
and will provide to Parent such additional information (including updated
lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and, except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall hold
in confidence the information    11   contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, destroy all copies of such information then in their possession (and
certify such destruction to the Company), except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been previously known on a nonconfidential
basis by Parent or Purchaser, in the public domain through no fault of Parent
or Purchaser or later Lawfully acquired by Parent or Purchaser on a
nonconfidential basis.   (b) Not later than the first Business Day following
execution of this Agreement and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the Company shall issue the Joint Press Release with Parent and shall file
with the SEC the Joint Press Release, under cover of Schedule 14D-9,
indicating on the front of such Schedule 14D-9 that such filing contains pre-
commencement communications.   (c) As soon as practicable on the day that
the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities Laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") that shall reflect
the recommendations of the Company\'s Board of Directors referred to in
Section 2.2(a) above. The Company, Parent and Purchaser each agree promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the SEC. The Company also
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel in writing with any comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
consult with and provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the response of the Company to such comments prior
to responding.   SECTION 2.3 DIRECTORS.   (a) Promptly upon Consummation
of the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate for appointment or
election to the Company\'s Board of Directors, upon written notice to the
Company, such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company\'s Board of Directors such that the percentage of its designees
on the Board shall equal the percentage of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by Parent and its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries (the "PARENT DESIGNEES"). In connection with the
foregoing, the Company has taken all action reasonably necessary to permit
the Parent Designees to (i) be elected to the Company\'s Board of Directors
promptly following Consummation of the Offer, including without limitation,
increasing the size of the Company\'s Board of Directors and obtaining the
resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to give
effect to the foregoing provision and (ii) constitute at least the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company\'s
Board of Directors of (A) each committee of the Company\'s Board
of Directors, (B) each board of directors (or similar body) of   
12  each Subsidiary of the Company and (C) each committee (or similar body)
of each such board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time,
the Company\'s Board of Directors shall have at least three directors who
are directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and who are not
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "INDEPENDENT
DIRECTORS"); provided, however, that (x) notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the requirement to have at least three Independent Directors
result in Parent\'s designees constituting less than a majority of the
Company\'s Board of Directors unless Parent shall have failed to designate a
sufficient number of Persons to constitute at least a majority and (y) if the
number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason
whatsoever (or if immediately following Consummation of the Offer there are
not at least three then-existing directors of the Company who (1) are
Qualified Persons (as defined below) and (2) are willing to serve as
Independent Directors), then the number of Independent Directors required
hereunder shall be reduced to equal the number of then-serving Independent
Directors, unless the remaining Independent Director or Independent Directors
are able to identify a person or persons, as the case may be, who are not
officers or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (any such person being referred to herein as a "QUALIFIED
PERSON") willing to serve as an Independent Director, in which case such
remaining Independent Director or Independent Directors shall be
entitled (but not required) to designate any such Qualified Person or Persons
to fill such vacancies, and such designated Qualified Person shall be deemed
to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other Directors shall be entitled (but
not required) to designate three Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies,
and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement.   The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.3(a),
including mailing to shareholders the information required by such Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule
14D-9 if it receives from Parent and Purchaser the information below on a
basis timely to permit such mailing) as is necessary to enable the Parent
Designees to be elected to the Company\'s Board of Directors. The Company\'s
obligations to appoint the Parent Designees to the Company\'s Board of
Directors shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent or Purchaser shall supply
the Company in writing any information with respect to either of them and
their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary in connection with the appointment of
any of Parent\'s designees under this Section 2.3(a). The provisions of this
Section 2.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that
Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of Law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.   (b) Following the
election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 2.3(a),
the approval by affirmative vote or written consent by a majority of the
Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one
Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company\'s Board of Directors and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any
other director of the Company, shall be required or permitted to authorize)
(i) any amendment or termination of this    13    Agreement by the
Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent or Purchaser or (iii) any waiver or exercise of
any of the Company\'s rights under this Agreement. Any action that requires
approval by the Independent Directors shall be deemed to be approved by a
majority of the Independent Directors if there is no Independent Director and
such action is approved by the Company\'s Board of Directors.   SECTION 2.4
MERGER WITHOUT MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. If following Consummation of the
Offer (or any subsequent offering period), Purchaser owns at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, each of the parties hereto shall
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without the Company
Shareholder Meeting, in accordance with Section 3053 of the PRGCL.  
ARTICLE III  THE MERGER AND RELATED MATTERS   SECTION 3.1 THE MERGER.

the later of the date on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Department of State of Puerto Rico or such time as is agreed upon by
the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time is

Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in Section 3059 of the PRGCL.   SECTION 3.2 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, or, if no such date is specified, on the second Business Day after

applicable parties, of all of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof
(the "CLOSING DATE"), at a location to be mutually agreed to by the Company
and Parent.   SECTION 3.6 SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS. If at any time after the

IV  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   SECTION 4.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Purchaser:   (a) Purchaser Capital Stock. Each share of
capital stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   
15     (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Purchaser-Owned Stock. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Exchange of
Shares of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock (other
than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 4.1(b) and any shares
that are held by shareholders exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section
3062 of the PRGCL ("DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS")) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"), upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such share in the manner provided in Section 4.2. All
such shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 4.2, without interest.   SECTION 4.2 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company organized under the Laws of the
United States or any state thereof and located therein reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") to receive in trust
the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 4.1(c). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. The Paying Agent shall invest such funds as
directed by the Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Company\'s shareholders
pursuant to this Article IV. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
replace any monies lost through an investment made pursuant to this Section
4.2. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the exclusive property of and shall be paid promptly to the Parent.   (b)
Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES"), whose shares
were converted pursuant to Section 4.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate   
16    so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
4.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Section 4.2. The right of any shareholder to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable
withholding Tax obligation.   (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership
Rights in the Shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common
Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
IV except as otherwise provided by Law.   (d) Termination of Fund; No
Liability. At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.   SECTION 4.3 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting
Shareholder shall demand to be paid the fair cash value of such holder\'s
shares of Company Common Stock, as provided in Section 3062 of the PRGCL,
such shares shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration except as provided in this Section 4.3, and
the Company shall give Parent notice of any written objections to this
Agreement or the Merger under Section 3062 of the PRGCL received by the
Company and of any demands received by the Company for the fair   
17    cash value of any shares of Company Common Stock and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares had been converted into the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 4.1.   SECTION 4.4
LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver
the Merger Consideration for each of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.   ARTICLE V  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES;
STANDARDS  FOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   SECTION 5.1 DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULES. Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
has delivered to Parent, and Parent has delivered to the Company, a schedule
(in the case of the Company, the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE," and in the
case of Parent, the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") setting forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, desires or is required to make either in response to an express
disclosure requirement contained in a provision of this Agreement or as an
exception to one or more of such party\'s representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in Article VI, in the case of the Company,
or Article VII, in the case of Parent and Purchaser, or to one or more of
such party\'s covenants contained in Article VIII. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary (i) no such item is required to be set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty (other than the representations and warranties contained in Sections
6.1(a), 6.1(c), 6.1(d), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19,
6.25, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5) if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the
standard established by Section 5.2, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in a Disclosure Schedule in response to an express disclosure requirement or
as an exception to a representation, warranty or covenant shall not be deemed
an admission by a party that such item is material or represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.   SECTION 5.2 STANDARDS.
No representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article VI (other
than the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(c),
6.1(d), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19 and 6.25) or of
Parent and Purchaser in Article VII (other than the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5) shall be deemed
untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement or the   
18    Offer and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached any
such representation or warranty for any purpose under this Agreement, in any
case as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance
or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or when taken
together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any
such representations or warranties contained in Article VI, in the case of
the Company, or Article VII, in the case of Parent and Purchaser, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.   ARTICLE VI 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to, and
covenants and agrees with, Parent and Purchaser as set forth below in this
Article VI. Each exception set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule and
each other response to this Agreement set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under a heading
referring to, a specific individual Section of this Agreement.   SECTION

of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and each such Person
has all requisite corporate (or partnership, or limited liability company as

date of this Agreement.   (d) The respective certificates or articles of
incorporation and by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company do not contain any provision limiting or
otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to control such
Subsidiaries. Section 6.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

6.5 COMPANY REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   (a) Since December 31,
1999, the Company and, to the extent applicable, its Subsidiaries, have filed
all forms, reports and documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by it
pursuant to the federal securities Laws and the SEC rules and regulations
thereunder, and all forms, reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents filed with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent

date of this Agreement, made available to Parent true, complete and correct
copies of all Company SEC Reports filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with the SEC between December 31, 1999 and the date of this Agreement. As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true, complete
and correct copy of all correspondence since December 31, 1999 to
date between the Company and the SEC, other than routine transmittal
letters.   (b) The Financial Statements (i) comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC, (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein
or in the notes or schedules thereto) and (iii) present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and changes in shareholders\' equity and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements,
to normal year-end adjustments).   (c) Except as set forth on the Balance
Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), in each case that is required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
except for (i) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with this
Agreement and fees and expenses related thereto, and (ii) liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in default in respect of the terms and conditions
of any indebtedness or other agreement which would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has no obligations under any "off-balance sheet" financings or
similar transactions, other than such obligations (i) that are specifically
disclosed in its reports to the SEC, (ii) that constitute lease transactions
entered into in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) that are not
specified in clauses (i) or (ii) and do not represent obligations in excess
of U.S. $100,000 in the aggregate.    22     SECTION 6.6 INFORMATION TO
BE SUPPLIED.   (a) Each of the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement
and the other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all material respects with the

Proxy Statement, on the date it is mailed to shareholders of the Company and
at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, and none of the written
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents will
at the time the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and
first published, sent or given to the Company\'s shareholders, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.6, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 14D-9 based on information supplied by Parent or
Purchaser expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein or
based on information which is not included in or incorporated by reference in
such documents but which should have been disclosed pursuant to Section
7.4.   SECTION 6.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Except as explicitly
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement or as required or expressly permitted by this Agreement,
since December 31, 2001 the Company and its Subsidiaries have in all
material respects operated their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course and there has not occurred (i) any event, change, occurrence, effect,
fact, circumstance or condition which would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and
(ii) as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken any of the actions described in Sections 8.2(b)(1), (2), (3), (5),
(6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (13), (14), (15), (17) or (18).   SECTION 6.8
LITIGATION. Other than with respect to claims that are subject to complete
insurance coverage (other than with respect to deductibles pursuant to the
Company\'s insurance policies) pursuant to the Company\'s general liability,
automobile or workers compensation insurance policies and which do not exceed
U.S. $25,000 individually or U.S. $250,000 in the aggregate, and except as
explicitly disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, there are no investigations, actions, suits or proceedings
pending against the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective properties, rights or franchises), at Law or in equity, or before
or by any Puerto Rico, federal, state, local or foreign commission, board,
bureau, agency, regulatory or administrative instrumentality or other
Governmental Authority or any arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. The Company
does not have Knowledge of any valid basis for any action, proceeding or
investigation against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment that has not
been satisfied in all respects or any order or decree that remains in
effect,    23    which in any such case was entered in any lawsuit or
proceeding in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was a party.  
SECTION 6.9 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ENCUMBRANCES; LEASES.   (a) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has good, valid and indefeasible title to all of
its tangible properties and assets, with full right to convey the same; in
each case subject to no Liens, except for (A) Liens reflected in the Balance
Sheet, (B) Liens consisting of zoning or planning restrictions, easements,
permits and other restrictions or limitations on the use of real property or
irregularities in title thereto that do not detract from the value of, or
impair the use of, such property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the operation of their respective businesses and (C) Liens for current Taxes,
assessments or governmental charges or levies on property not yet due or
which are being contested in good faith. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any options or rights of first refusal or rights of
first offer to third parties to purchase or otherwise acquire an interest in
any of its tangible properties and assets. All properties and assets
reflected in the Balance Sheet have an aggregate fair market and realizable
value at least equal to the aggregate value thereof as reflected therein.  
(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has valid leasehold interests in
each of its leased premises (collectively, the "TENANT LEASES"). Each Tenant
Lease is in full force and effect, no notice of any default has been
delivered by any landlord under any of the Tenant Leases and to the Knowledge
of the Company there are no facts which would now or with the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both be a default under the terms of any of
the Tenant Leases. There are no pending claims by any tenant as to premises
leased to tenants by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "LANDLORD LEASES") and there are no pending claims by such tenants for
offsets against rent or other monetary claims made by tenants against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in its capacity as landlord.   SECTION
6.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except with respect to Taxes, which are the
subject of Section 6.13, environmental matters, which are the subject of
Section 6.16, employee benefits matters, which are the subject of Section
6.11, and labor matters, which are the subject of Section 6.22, and except as
explicitly disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement:   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied and are presently complying with all applicable Laws, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notification of
any asserted present or past failure to so comply.   (b) The Company and
its Subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally required, all Puerto Rico,
federal, state, local and foreign permits, approvals, licenses,
authorizations, certificates, rights, exemptions and orders from Governmental
Authorities (the "PERMITS") that are required for the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as now
conducted.    24     (c) Each of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
tangible properties and assets is in material compliance with all applicable
Laws, including, without limitation, all Laws with respect to zoning,
building, fire and health codes.   SECTION 6.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  
(a) Section 6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of each deferred compensation and each incentive compensation,
equity compensation plan, "welfare" plan, fund or program (within the meaning
of section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")); "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of
section 3(2) of ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement;
and each other employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or
arrangement, in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Company or by any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"), that together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of section
4001(b) of ERISA, or to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is party,
whether written or oral, for the benefit of any employee or former employee
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (the "COMPANY
BENEFIT PLANS").   (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the
Company has furnished to Buyer a complete and correct copy of each Company
Benefit Plan and any amendments thereto (or if the Company Benefit Plan is
not a written plan, a description thereof), any related trust or other
funding vehicle, any reports or summaries required under ERISA or the Code
and the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under
section 401 of the Code.   (c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
since December 31, 1997 that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk
to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any liability under such Title, other than liability for premiums
due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), which payments have
been or will be made when due. Insofar as the representation made in this
Section 6.11(c) applies to Section 4064, 4069 or 4204 of ERISA, it is made
with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions
during the six-year period ending on the last day of the most recent plan
year ended before the date of this Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Company Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted. All contributions and premiums required to be
paid under (i) the terms of each of the Company Benefit Plans subject to
ERISA and (ii) Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, have, to the
extent due, been paid in full or properly recorded on the financial
statements or records of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate. No Company
Benefit Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred
any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.    25     (d) No
Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in section
3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Company Benefit Plan a plan described in section
4063(a) of ERISA.   (e) Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable
laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. The administrator of
each of the Company Benefit Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a currently effective
determination letter from the IRS stating that it is so qualified, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company no event has occurred which would adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to rely on such determination. None of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any of the
Company Benefit Plans, any trust created thereunder, nor to the Company\'s
Knowledge, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction
or has taken or failed to take any action in connection with which the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate could be
subject to any material liability for either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975, 4976 or 4980B of the Code. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by or on behalf of any Company
Benefit Plan, by any employee or beneficiary under any such Company Benefit
Plan or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party
to any agreement or understanding, whether written or unwritten, with the
PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor or the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services with respect to a Company Benefit Plan.   (f) Section
6.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) each Company
Benefit Plan which provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or
similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former employees
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for periods extending beyond
their retirement or other termination of service, other than (x) coverage
mandated by applicable law, (y) death benefits under any "pension plan," or
(z) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former
employee (or his beneficiary) and (ii) any unfunded liability of the Company
or and Subsidiary of the Company with respect to each such Company Benefit
Plan.   (g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due
any such employee or officer.   (h) No "leased employee," as that term is
defined in Section 414(n) of the Code, performs services for the Company. The
Company has not (i) used the services or workers provided by third party
contract labor suppliers, temporary employees, "leased employees," or
individuals who have provided services as independent contractors in such a
manner as would reasonably be expected to cause such workers to have become
eligible to participate in the Company Benefit Plans or (ii) used the
services of individuals to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any of the Company Benefit   
26    Plans or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to
the Company Benefit Plans by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of
Labor, the PBGC, or any other Governmental Body.   (i) With respect to each
Company Benefit Plan established or maintained outside of the United States
of America primarily for benefit of employees of the Company residing outside
the United States of America (a "FOREIGN PLAN"): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Foreign Plan required by law or by the terms
of such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued, in
accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Measurement
Date, with respect to all current and former participants in such plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign
Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.   SECTION 6.12 BOOKS
AND RECORDS. The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other
records of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company have been
maintained in accordance with sound business practices and the requirements
of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. The Company has made available to
Parent the complete minute books of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
periods after December 31, 1997, and such minute books contain true and
correct records of all corporate action taken by the Company\'s and each of
its Subsidiaries\' shareholders, Boards of Directors and committees of the
Boards of Directors since December 31, 1997, and no meeting of any of such
shareholders, the Boards of Directors or such committees has been held for
which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute
books.   SECTION 6.13 TAXES. Except as explicitly disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement:   (a) The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with
the appropriate taxing authorities all returns, statements, forms and reports
for federal income and other Taxes (as hereinafter defined) ("RETURNS") that
are required to be filed by, or with respect to, the Company and such
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date. The Returns as filed were true,
correct and complete and accurately reflect all liability for Taxes for the
periods covered thereby. "TAXES" shall mean all taxes, assessments, charges,
duties, fees, levies or other governmental charges including, without
limitation, all Puerto Rico, federal, state, local, foreign and other income,
franchise, profits, capital gains, capital stock, transfer, sales, use,
value-added, occupation, property, excise, severance, windfall profits,
stamp, license, payroll, withholding and other taxes, assessments, charges,
duties, fees, levies or other governmental charges of any kind whatsoever
(whether payable directly or by withholding and whether or not requiring the
filing of a Return), all estimated taxes, and all deficiency assessments,
additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto and shall
include any    27    liability for such amounts as a result either of
being a member of a combined, consolidated, unitary or affiliated group or of
a contractual obligation to indemnify, any Person.   (b) All Taxes and
liabilities for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that have become
due and payable have been timely paid or fully provided for as a liability on
the Financial Statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes
thereto) in accordance with GAAP. Since the date of the Balance Sheet,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred liability for
Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business.   (c) No deficiencies
for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, which are not fully reserved for or which are not being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. No Governmental Authority
is currently conducting a tax audit or investigation with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or has asked in writing for an extension
or waiver of an applicable statute of limitations. With respect to Taxes or
any Return, no power of attorney has been executed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the Company\'s Knowledge, there is no dispute or claim
concerning any liability for Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
either claimed or raised by any taxing authority in writing.   (d) Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of any affiliated
group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, or any similar
affiliated or consolidated group for tax purposes under Puerto Rico, state,
local or foreign Law (other than a group the common parent of which is the
Company), or has any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of Puerto Rico, state, local or foreign Law as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.   (e) All Taxes which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (or was) required by Law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected, and have been timely paid over
to the proper authorities to the extent due and payable.   (f) There are no
Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreements (in writing)
in effect as between the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any predecessor
or Affiliate of any of them and any other party under which the Company (or
any of its Subsidiaries) could be liable for any Taxes of any party other
than the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.   (g) Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, plan, contract or
arrangement that could result, separately or in the aggregate, in a payment
of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.   (h) No election under Section 341(f) of the Code has been made or
shall be made prior to the Closing Date to treat the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a consenting corporation, as defined in Section 341 of
the Code.   (i) No transaction contemplated by this Agreement is subject
to withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.    28     (j) There are
no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due or for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.   (k) No unresolved
claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
Taxes has been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not pay Taxes or file Returns.  
SECTION 6.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Company and its Subsidiaries own, or
are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use in the manner
currently used, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights,
trade names, trade name rights, service marks, service mark rights,
copyrights and other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer
programs (collectively, "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS") which are used in the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not alter or
impair any Intellectual Property Rights in any respect. No claims are pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing
or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any person with regard to
any Intellectual Property Right. To the Knowledge of the Company, no person

to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or
information statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement,

mailed to its shareholders, provided that no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without consultation with Parent
and its counsel;   (c) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the Company\'s Board of Directors that shareholders of the Company vote in
favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement; and   (d)
if proxies are solicited from Company shareholders, use reasonable best

action necessary and advisable, to secure the vote of shareholders required
by applicable Law and the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws

REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION   (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use

and approvals from any Governmental Authority and the making of all necessary

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement; provided, however, that no loan
agreement or contract for borrowed money entered into by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be repaid except as currently required by its
terms, in whole or in part, and no contract shall be amended to increase the
amount payable thereunder or otherwise to be more burdensome to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in order to obtain any such consent, approval or
authorization without first    44    obtaining the written approval of
Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Nothing contained
in this Section 8.4 shall prohibit the Company and its Subsidiaries from
taking any action permitted by Section 8.5 or from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1.   (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of (i) any representation or warranty made by the Company contained in

fail to be satisfied; or (ii) the failure by the Company to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that no such

agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.   (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company

in this Agreement becoming untrue or incorrect, subject to the standard
established in Section 5.2 where applicable, in any respect or (ii) the
failure by Parent or Purchaser to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Parent or
Purchaser or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.   SECTION 8.5 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors, attorneys and other advisors, representatives and agents to,
immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted with any parties other than Parent or Purchaser with respect to any
Takeover Proposal (as defined below). The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of or any financial advisor,
attorney or other advisor, representative or agent of it or any of its
Affiliates, to (i) directly or indirectly solicit, facilitate, initiate or
encourage the making or submission of, any Takeover Proposal (including,
without limitation, taking any action which would make Article TENTH of the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation not applicable to a Takeover
Proposal), (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon or terminate this Agreement or to
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) initiate or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person (other than a
party to this Agreement) any information with respect to, or take any other
action intentionally to facilitate or in furtherance of any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of the Company\'s
equity securities (other than to permit the Company to receive a Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach of any other provision of this
Section 8.5(a)); provided that prior to Consummation of the Offer, in
response to a Takeover Proposal that did not result from the   
45    breach of this Section 8.5 and following delivery to Parent of
notice of the Takeover Proposal in compliance with its obligations under
Section 8.5(d) hereof, the Company may (1) in response to any Takeover
Proposal, request clarifications from (but not, except as contemplated by
clause (2) below, participate in discussions or negotiations with) any third
party which makes such Takeover Proposal, if such action is taken solely for
the purpose of obtaining information reasonably necessary for the Company to
ascertain whether such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations with or furnish information
(pursuant to a confidentiality/standstill agreement with customary terms as
reasonably determined in good faith by the Company after consultation with
outside counsel; provided that each such agreement is at least as limiting as
any such agreement between Parent and the Company) to any third party which
has made a bona fide Takeover Proposal if (A) the Company\'s Board of
Directors reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) that taking such action would be reasonably likely to lead
to the delivery to the Company of a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company\'s
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 8.5(a) directly or indirectly by any of its
Subsidiaries, officers, Affiliates or directors or any advisor,
representative, consultant or agent retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall constitute a breach of this Section
8.5(a) by the Company. The Company will take all actions necessary or
advisable to inform the appropriate individuals or entities referred to in
the prior sentence of the obligations undertaken in this Section 8.5. For
purposes of this Section 8.5, a Person shall be deemed to have facilitated or
encouraged an action or result only if any act or omission by such Person (i)
would reasonably be expected to facilitate or encourage such action or result
or (ii) was intended by such Person to facilitate or encourage such action or
result.   For purposes of this Agreement, "TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means
any indication of interest in, or proposal or offer for, (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of the assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning
15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
sale of all or any substantial portion of the assets, recapitalization,
liquidation or a dissolution of, or similar transaction of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries other than the Offer or the Merger, which in any such
case has been communicated (including as a result of any press release or
other public disclosure) to (1) any of the individuals signing a Transaction
Support Agreement on behalf of a stockholder party thereto, (2) any of the
Persons identified as having Knowledge in Schedule 1.1 or (3) the Company\'s
Board of Directors generally; and "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal made by a third party to purchase all of the
outstanding equity securities of the Company pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger or other business combination (x) on terms which the
Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith to be superior to the
Company and its shareholders (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates), in their capacity as shareholders, from a financial
point of view (taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and identity    46    of
the offeror and the financial capacity of the offeror to consummate
the transaction) as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby and
any alternative proposed by Parent or Purchaser in accordance with Section
10.1(c) hereof, such determination having been made only after consultation
with the Company\'s financial advisor, (y) for which financing is committed
or cash is available and (z) which is reasonably capable of being
consummated.   (b) The Company agrees that, except as set forth in
Section 8.5(c), neither the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or
recommendation of the Company\'s Board of Directors of the Offer, the Merger
or this Agreement, unless the Company\'s Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel that
such withdrawal or modification is necessary in order to satisfy its
fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law, (ii)
approve or recommend, or, in the case of a committee, propose to the
Company\'s Board of Directors to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
or (iii) approve, recommend or cause it to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
(each, an "ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to any Takeover Proposal. For
purposes of this clause (b), if the Company Board of Directors or any such
committee proposal is publicly disclosed, regardless of the source of, or the
circumstances surrounding, the disclosure, such Company Board of Directors or
committee proposal shall be deemed to have been made publicly.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to Consummation of the
Offer, the Company and/or the Company\'s Board of Directors may take the
actions otherwise prohibited by Sections 8.5(a) and 8.5(b) if (i) a third
party makes a Takeover Proposal which the Company has determined to be a
Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.5(a), (ii) the
Company complies with its obligations under Section 8.5(d), (iii) all of the
conditions to the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 10.1(c) hereof shall have been satisfied (including expiration
of the five Business Day period described therein (or such shorter period as
may be provided therein) and payment of all amounts due and payable pursuant
to Section 10.3 and (iv) simultaneously therewith, this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 10.1(c)(i) hereof.   (d) The Company
agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8.5, promptly after (but in no
event more than two calendar days after) receipt thereof, the Company shall
advise Parent in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or amended Takeover
Proposal or (ii) any Superior Proposal, as well as in either such case the
material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal

any such Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company provided to any
other Person in connection with any such Takeover Proposal or Superior
Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.   (e) Parent and
Purchaser agree that nothing contained in this Section 8.5 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position   
47    contemplated by Rule 14D-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to any tender offer or from making any required
disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Company\'s Board of Directors, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law.   SECTION 8.6 ANTITRUST
LAWS.   (a) Each party hereto shall (i) take promptly (but in no event

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law;
provided, however, that the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, commit to any divestiture transaction and Parent shall not
be required to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commence to take
any action that, in the reasonable discretion of Parent, materially limits
its ability to conduct the business or its ability to retain the Company or
any material portion of the assets of the Company.   (c) Each party hereto
shall promptly inform the other parties of any material communication made
to, or received by such party from, any Antitrust Authority or any other

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.   (a) Parent,
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of the present or former directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") for acts or omissions
of such Persons occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, as provided in
the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or the   
48    certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or similar
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries or the terms of any
individual indemnity agreement or other arrangement with any director or
executive officer, which agreement or arrangement is listed in Section 8.7 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for six years after the Effective Time (without modification or
amendment, except as required by applicable Law) in accordance with their
terms, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and shall be enforceable by
the Indemnified Parties against the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorney\'s fees) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party to the extent that the
indemnifiable amount is paid by an insurer pursuant to Section 8.7(b). If
within six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is merged
with and into Parent or another Person, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of Parent or such other
Person shall, for at least the six-year period following the Effective Time,
provide rights to indemnification for the Indemnified Persons at least
equivalent to those in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. Subject to the foregoing, nothing is this Section 8.7
shall prevent a merger, consolidation, or business combination of
the Surviving Corporation with another entity.   (b) Purchaser shall cause
to be maintained in effect for not less than six years from the Effective
Time the current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Purchaser may substitute
therefor policies of at least equivalent coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence or
Section 8.2 to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to procure,
prior to the Effective Time, a policy for directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, having a term lasting no less than six years following the Effective
Time and providing U.S. $15,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be obtained
pursuant to the proviso at the end of this sentence) in coverage, and
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous than the
Company\'s current policies with respect to such insurance, provided that the
aggregate premium payable therefor shall not exceed U.S. $350,000. The
provisions of this Section 8.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 8.7(b) may not be amended, waived or altered in
any respect without the prior written unanimous approval of the Company\'s
Board of Directors.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to, or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\'
and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8.7 is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.   SECTION
8.8 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Joint Press Release referenced in Section
2.1(b) with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be
reasonably    49    acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation
and review by the other party of such release or statement, except as may be
required by Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, or as may be permitted
pursuant to Section 8.5.   SECTION 8.9 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS.   (a) From
and after the Measurement Date, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in
effect on the date of this Agreement), all the Company\'s employment,
severance and termination agreements, plans and policies existing prior to
the execution of this Agreement which are between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any director, officer, employee or consultant thereof and
which have been disclosed in Section 8.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that Consummation of the Offer
would constitute a "Change in Control" (or the similar relevant defined term)
for all purposes pursuant to those agreements and arrangements indicated on
Section 8.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (b) From and after the
Measurement Date, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall provide severance pay to any employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company in such amount as may be required by Act no. 80,
approved May 30, 1976, 29 L.P.R.A. ss. 185a et. seq.   (c) For a period of
six months from and after the Measurement Date, Parent shall, unless the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Measurement Date (the
"COMPANY EMPLOYEES") shall otherwise agree or different terms are negotiated
with the relevant union representing such employees, cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Company Employees employee benefits that are,
in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided immediately prior to
the Measurement Date to Company Employees; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 8.9 shall require Parent or Purchaser to continue
or replace, or cause to be continued or replaced, any Company Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Plan after the Measurement Date.   (d) Subject to compliance
with Section 8.9(a), nothing contained in this Section 8.9 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of
any Company Employee or any change in the compensation or employee benefits
available to any Company Employee or the amendment or termination of any
particular Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Measurement Date.   (e) For all purposes
under any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time, (all such employee
benefit plans are hereinafter referred to as the "New Plans"), each such
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such employee was entitled, before    50    the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plans for purposes
of (i) eligibility to participate and (ii) vesting, but in no event shall
such service be taken into account in determining the accrual of benefits
under any New Plan, including, but not limited to, a defined benefit plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (x) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time and (y) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to
any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents (other than limitations or waiting periods that
are already in effect with respect to such employees and dependents and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time), and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company Benefit Plan
ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins, to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.   SECTION 8.10 AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS. Until the
Closing Date, Parent and Purchaser shall make available Sufficient Funds at
the times required under this Agreement.   ARTICLE IX  CONDITIONS TO THE
MERGER   SECTION 9.1 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY. The
obligations of the Company, Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Merger are
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:   (a) This
Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by the requisite vote of the
shareholders of the Company, if required by applicable Law, in order to
consummate the Merger;   (b) No provision of any applicable Law or
regulation and no judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall prohibit the consummation of the
Merger; and   (c) Purchaser, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent shall
have purchased shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be entitled to
rely on the condition in this Section 9.1(c) if either of them shall have
failed to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in
breach of their obligations under this Agreement.    51     ARTICLE
X  TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT   SECTION 10.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval:  
(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; provided, that any
such consent by the Company on or after the Measurement Date shall have been
duly authorized by unanimous vote of the Company\'s Board of Directors,
including all Independent Directors; or   (b) by Parent:   (i) if at any
time prior to Consummation of the  Offer, the Company has breached any
representation or warranty, or  prior to the Effective Time has breached any
covenant or other  agreement contained in this Agreement, which (A) would
give rise to  the failure of a condition set forth in clause (c) of Annex I,
(B)  cannot be or has not been cured within the applicable Cure Period 
therefor or by the Termination Date, whichever is earlier, and (C) has  not
been waived by Parent pursuant to the provisions hereof (provided  that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause  (i) if
either Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any  representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in  this Agreement);   (ii)
if at any time prior to Consummation of the  Offer, (A) the Company, or the
Company\'s Board of Directors, as the  case may be, shall have (w) after the
date hereof, entered into any  agreement, other than a
confidentiality/standstill agreement permitted  under Section 8.5, with
respect to any Takeover Proposal other than  the Offer or the Merger, (x)
amended, conditioned, qualified,  withdrawn, modified or contradicted or
resolved to do any of the  foregoing, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, its approval  and recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this
Agreement  (regardless of whether such action was permitted under this 
Agreement), (y) approved or recommended any Takeover Proposal other  than the
Offer or the Merger or (z) failed to reject any Takeover  Proposal or amended
Takeover Proposal within the applicable Rejection  Period therefor (except
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this clause (z)
prior to the Initial Expiration Date), or  (B) the Company or the Company\'s
Board of Directors shall have  resolved to do any of the foregoing; or  
(iii) if the Company breaches in any material  respect its obligations under
Section 8.5 hereof; or   (c) by the Company:   (i) if at any time prior to
Consummation of the  Offer (A) a Superior Proposal is received by the Company
and (B) the  Company\'s Board of Directors reasonably determines in good
faith  (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to 
terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement to effect the  Superior
Proposal in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the  Company\'s
shareholders under    52     applicable Law; provided that the Company
may not terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(i) unless
and until (x)  five Business Days have elapsed following delivery to Parent
of a  written notice of such determination by the Company\'s Board of 
Directors and during such five Business Day period the Company has  fully
cooperated with Parent, including, without limitation, informing  Parent of
the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, with the  intent of
enabling both parties to agree to a modification of the  terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that the transactions  contemplated hereby may be
effected; (y) at the end of such five  Business Day period the Takeover
Proposal continues to constitute a  Superior Proposal and the Company\'s
Board of Directors confirms its  determination (after consultation with
outside counsel) that it is  necessary to terminate this Agreement and enter
into an agreement to  effect the Superior Proposal to comply with its
fiduciary duties under  applicable Law; and (z) (1) at or prior to such
termination, Parent  has received the Termination Fee set forth in Section
10.3 hereof by  wire transfer in immediately available funds and (2)
immediately  following such termination the Company enters into a
definitive  acquisition, merger or similar agreement to effect the Superior 
Proposal; provided, however, that, if the written notice contemplated  in
clause (x) above is given to Parent less than five Business Days,  but more
than two Business Days, prior to the then-scheduled  expiration of the Offer,
then the Company will be permitted to  terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(c)(i) no earlier than  24 hours before such scheduled expiration
if the Company has complied  with all of the requirements of this Section
10.1(c)(i) (with the five  Business Day period set forth in clauses (x) and
(y) above being  deemed to end when such 24-hour period begins for purposes
of  determining such compliance) unless, prior to the beginning of such 
24-hour period, Purchaser shall have extended the Offer to a date that  is at
least five Business Days after the delivery of such notice to  Parent, in
which case the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this
Section 10.1(c)(i) shall be determined without regard  to this proviso;
provided, further, that it is understood and agreed  that if the written
notice contemplated in clause (x) above is given  to Parent less than two
Business Days prior to the then-scheduled  expiration of the Offer, the
Company\'s right to terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(c)(i) shall be subject to  compliance with all of the requirements of
this Section 10.1(c)(i),  including the five Business Day period set forth in
clauses (x) and  (y) hereof without regard to the immediately preceding
proviso; or   (ii) if Parent or Purchaser shall have (x) failed to 
commence the Offer as provided in Section 2.1, provided the Company is  not
in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement ,(y)  failed to
pay for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer  in accordance
with Section 2.1 hereof or (z) breached in any material  respect any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants  or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot  be or has not been cured
within 30 days after receipt of written  notice thereof by Parent or by the
Termination Date, whichever is  earlier; or   (iii) if Parent or Purchaser
breach their  obligations to make available Sufficient Funds at the times
required  under this Agreement; or    53     (d) by either Parent or
the Company:   (i) if the Offer has not been consummated on or  before the
Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this  Agreement
pursuant to this clause shall not be available to any party  whose failure to
fulfill any material obligation of this Agreement or  other material breach
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or  resulted in, the failure of the
Offer to have been consummated on or  prior to the aforesaid date; or  
(ii) if, as a result of the failure of any of the  conditions set forth in
Annex I to this Agreement, the Offer shall  have terminated or expired in
accordance with its terms without  Purchaser having purchased any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant  to the Offer; provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this clause shall not be available to
any party whose  failure to fulfill any material obligation under this
Agreement or  other material breach of this Agreement has resulted in the
failure of  such condition; or   (iii) if any court of competent
jurisdiction or any  Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or  taken any other action permanently restricting,
enjoining, restraining  or otherwise prohibiting Consummation of the Offer or
consummation of  the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have  become final and nonappealable.   SECTION 10.2 EFFECT OF
TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent or the
Company, as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser or their respective officers or directors (except as set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 10.2 and Sections 10.3,
11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10, 11.12, 11.13, 11.14 and 11.16 which
shall survive the termination); provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 10.2 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
breach of this Agreement. In addition, in the event of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms (including payment of any applicable
Termination Fee due and payable pursuant to Section 10.3), Purchaser shall,
and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly terminate the Offer without
accepting any shares of Company Common Stock for payment.   SECTION 10.3
PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES   (a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent in
accordance with Section 10.1(b)(ii) or 10.1(b)(iii) by the Company pursuant
to Section 10.1(c)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee
in an amount equal to U.S. $5,400,000 (the "TERMINATION FEE").   (b) If (i)
this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i),
(B) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i), or (C) Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii), and (ii) the Minimum Condition
or any of the conditions listed in Section (c) of Annex I to this Agreement
shall fail to have been satisfied as of the date of such termination, and
(iii) it has become publicly known that a Takeover Proposal or   
54    amended Takeover Proposal has been made after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the effective date of such termination and (iv)
concurrently with or within 12 months of the date of such termination to a
Third Party Acquisition Event occurs, then the Company shall within one
Business Day of the occurrence of such Third Party Acquisition Event, if any,
pay to Parent the Termination Fee.   "THIRD PARTY ACQUISITION EVENT" shall
mean (i) the consummation of a Takeover Proposal involving the purchase of a
majority of either the equity securities of the Company or of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any such transaction that, if it had been proposed prior to the termination
of this Agreement would have constituted a Takeover Proposal or (ii) the
entering into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a definitive
agreement with respect to any such transaction.   (c) Any payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. If the Company fails to pay to Parent the
Termination Fee when due hereunder, the Company shall pay the reasonable
costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount
of any unpaid fee and/or expense at the publicly announced prime rate for
leading money center banks as published in The Wall Street Journal from the
date such fee and/or expense was required to be paid to the date it is
paid.   ARTICLE XI  MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 11.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND

the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, contained herein
or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or at the
Closing shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation
made by any party. Each and every such representation and warranty shall
expire with, and be terminated and extinguished by, the Closing and

liability whatsoever with respect to any such representation or warranty.
This Section 11.1 shall have no effect upon any other obligation of the
parties hereto, whether to be performed before or after the Effective
Time.   SECTION 11.2 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective

Agreement and the schedules and other documents referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, collectively contain the entire understanding of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, with
respect thereto.   SECTION 11.5 BINDING EFFECT; BENEFIT; ASSIGNMENT. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and, with respect to the provisions of Section 8.7 hereof, shall inure
to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting from the provisions
thereof who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that Purchaser may assign and transfer its rights
and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates, provided that such
assignment shall not release Parent from its obligations hereunder. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.   SECTION 11.6 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. Subject to applicable
Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in writing by
the parties hereto in all respects before the Effective Time (whether before
or after the Company Shareholder Approval), by action taken by the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company (or, if required by
Section 2.3, the Independent Directors) or by the    57    respective
officers authorized by such Boards of Directors or the Independent Directors,
as the case may be; provided, however, that after the Company Shareholder
Approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval
by the shareholders of the Company without such further approval.   SECTION
11.7 FURTHER ACTIONS. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to its legal obligations and
fiduciary duties, it will use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill all
conditions precedent specified herein, to the extent that such conditions are
within its control, and to do all things reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 11.8 INTERPRETATION. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The phrases "the
date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar import,
unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to June 11,
2002.   SECTION 11.9 ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the jurisdiction of any court located
in County of New York, State of New York (a "STATE COURT") or in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "FEDERAL
COURT") for the purpose of any action arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought
by any party hereto and for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment
rendered in respect thereof, (b) waives, and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is
not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
assets or property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the
action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action
is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts and
(c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in
any court other than a State Court or the Federal Court. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company irrevocably appoints LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and
MacRae, L.L.P., as its agent for the sole purpose of receiving service of
process or other legal summons in connection with any proceedings in the
State of New York. If the appointment of the person mentioned in this Section
11.9 ceases to be effective, Parent, Purchaser and the Company each agrees
that it will promptly appoint a further person in the State of New York to
accept service of process on its behalf in the State of New York and so
notify the other parties to this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section
11.9 shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.    58     SECTION 11.10 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise
set forth in Section 10.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses (including any HSR Act
filing fees, which shall be for the account of Parent and Purchaser), whether
or not Consummation of the Offer occurs.   SECTION 11.11 COUNTERPARTS. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument.   SECTION 11.12 APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement
and the legal relations between the parties hereto shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (without
regard to the conflict of Laws rules thereof), except to the extent that the
PRGCL is mandatorily applicable to the Merger.   SECTION 11.13
SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.   SECTION 11.14 WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives
all right to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 11.15 TIME. Time is of the essence with  respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 11.16 EFFECT ON CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. The Company
agrees that the execution and delivery of this Agreement constitutes the
consent of the Company\'s Board of Directors to the taking by Parent and
Purchaser of the actions otherwise prohibited by the standstill provisions
set forth in the sixth paragraph, and the non-solicitation provisions set
forth in the seventh paragraph, of the Confidentiality Agreement, whether
through the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction
Support Agreements or otherwise. The Company and Parent agree
that notwithstanding anything in Section 10.2 or in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, the standstill provisions set forth in the sixth
paragraph of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not survive and shall
forthwith become void in the event that the Options (as defined in the
Transaction Support Agreements) become exercisable pursuant to the terms of
the Transaction Support Agreements.    [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]

limitations on the ability of Purchaser or  Parent effectively to exercise
full rights of ownership of the shares  of the Company Common Stock
including, without limitation, the right  to vote the shares of the Company
Common Stock purchased by it on all  matters properly presented to the

disclosed in the  Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to  the date of the Merger Agreement, any change shall have
occurred (or  any development shall have occurred) after December 31, 2001,
in the  business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of 
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has had or  would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or   (iv) the Company\'s Board of Directors shall
have  withdrawn, or modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent or 
Purchaser (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9), its  recommendation
of the Offer, the Merger Agreement, or the Merger, or  recommended another
proposal or offer regarding a Takeover Proposal,  or shall have resolved to
do any of the foregoing; or   (v) the Merger Agreement shall have been 
terminated in accordance with its terms; or   (c) immediately prior to any

have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under the Merger Agreement required to have been performed at or
prior to such time, or (2) (i) subject to Section 5.2 of the Merger
Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Merger Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(c), 6.1(d), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15, 6.17, 6.18,
6.19 and 6.25) shall fail to be true and correct as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of any scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer as
though made on such date (or, in each case, if made as of a specified date,
as of such date) and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(c), 6.1(d), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15,
6.17, 6.18, 6.19 and 6.25 of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and
as of any scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer as though made
on such date (or, in each case, if made as of a specified date, as of such
date), or the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent and Purchaser a
certificate executed by an appropriate officer of the Company reasonably
acceptable to Parent as to the satisfaction of    Annex I-2    the
condition set forth in this paragraph (c) immediately prior to the scheduled
or any extended time of expiration of the Offer; or   (d) the Company shall
have failed to deliver to Parent and Purchaser resignations of a sufficient
number of the incumbent directors on the Company\'s Board of Directors
effective as of the Consummation of the Offer, and/or duly adopted
resolutions of the Company\'s Board of Directors, such that the Company has
satisfied its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Merger Agreement
that are required to be satisfied prior to Consummation of the Offer;  which
in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Parent or Purchaser but subject
to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, in any such case, and regardless
of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent
or Purchaser) giving rise to such conditions make it inadvisable to proceed
with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment of or payment for
shares of Company Common Stock.   Subject to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement, the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Purchaser and may be asserted by Purchaser or, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in the reasonable discretion of Parent or
Purchaser at any time prior to the scheduled or extended expiration date of
the Offer. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time prior to the scheduled or extended expiration date of
the Offer.    Annex I-3       [EXECUTION VERSION]    TRANSACTION
SUPPORT AGREEMENT   This Transaction Support Agreement, dated as of June 11,
2002 (this "Agreement"), is made by and among Cemex, S.A. de C.V., a
Mexico corporation ("Parent"), Tricem Acquisition, Corp., a Puerto Rico
corporation ("Purchaser"), and the stockholder of Puerto Rican Cement
Company, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation (the "Company"), identified on the
signature page hereto (the "Stockholder").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time,
the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in
this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement), pursuant to which (i) Purchaser shall commence a cash tender
offer (as such tender offer may hereafter be amended from time to time in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company
("Common Stock") in exchange for a net amount of $35.00 in cash (the "Offer
Price") in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and the Offer; and (ii) following consummation of the Offer,
the Company shall merge with Purchaser (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, the
Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner of the number of shares of
Common Stock set forth on Schedule A hereto (all such shares of Common Stock
and any shares of Common Stock hereafter acquired by the Stockholder, the
"Shares");   WHEREAS, as a condition to entering into the Merger
Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth therein, including the
Offer, Parent and Purchaser have required that the Stockholder agree to enter
into this Agreement and certain other stockholders of the Company agree to
enter into similar Transaction Support Agreements; and   WHEREAS, the
Stockholder wishes to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into the Merger
Agreement and, therefore, the Stockholder is willing to enter into this
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:      
ARTICLE I   TENDER OF SHARES   Section 1.01 Tender of Shares. The
Stockholder agrees to promptly (and, in any event, not later than two
Business Days prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer) tender or
cause to be tendered into the Offer, pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the Offer, and not withdraw or cause to be withdrawn (except
following the termination of the Offer in accordance with its terms), all of
the Shares. The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser\'s
obligation to accept for payment shares of Common Stock in the Offer,
including any Shares tendered by a Stockholder, is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Offer.   ARTICLE II   VOTING
AGREEMENT   Section 2.01 Voting Agreement. The Stockholder hereby agrees
that, from and after the date hereof and until the date (the
"Voting Termination Date") that is the later of (i) the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or (ii) the Option Termination
Date (as defined below), if any, at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, however called, and in any action by consent of the stockholders of
the Company, the Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) all the Shares
(i) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and all
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement
and otherwise in such manner as may be necessary to consummate the Merger;
(ii) against any action, proposal, agreement or transaction that would result
in a breach of any covenant, obligation, agreement, representation or
warranty of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder
contained in this Agreement; and (iii) against any action, agreement,
transaction (other than the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby) or proposal (including any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal)
that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the
Company\'s obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or that
is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay,
discourage or adversely affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement. Any vote by the Stockholder that is not in accordance with
this Section 2.01 shall be considered null and void, and the provisions of
Section 2.02 shall be deemed to take immediate effect.   Section 2.02
Irrevocable Proxy. If, and only if, the Stockholder fails to comply with the
provisions of Section 2.01, the Stockholder hereby agrees that such failure
shall result, without any further action by the Stockholder effective as of
the date of such failure, in the constitution and appointment of Parent and
each of its executive officers from and after the date of such determination
until the Voting Termination Date (at which point such constitution and
appointment shall automatically be revoked) as the Stockholder\'s attorney,
agent and proxy (such constitution and appointment, the "Irrevocable Proxy"),
with full power of substitution, to vote and otherwise act with   
2    respect to all the Shares at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or
postponed meeting), and in any action by written consent of the stockholders
of the Company, on the matters and in the manner specified in Section 2.01.
THIS PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY ARE IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST
AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND BINDING
ON ANY PERSON TO WHOM THE STOCKHOLDER MAY TRANSFER ANY OF ITS SHARES IN
BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. The Stockholder hereby revokes all other proxies
and powers of attorney with respect to all the Shares that may have
heretofore been appointed or granted, and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given (and if given, shall not be effective) by the
Stockholder with respect thereto. All authority herein conferred or agreed to
be conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the Stockholder and any
obligation of the Stockholder under this Agreement shall be binding upon the
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the
Stockholder.   ARTICLE III   THE OPTION   Section 3.01 Grant of Option.
The Stockholder hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option (each, an
"Option" and, collectively, the "Options") to purchase all of the Shares (the
"Option Shares") at a purchase price per Share (the "Purchase Price") equal
to $35.00, less the value of any dividends per Option Share declared or paid
from and after the date of this Agreement through the end of the Option
Exercise Period and subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7.13(a), other
than any dividends paid in accordance with clause (A) of Section 8.2(b)(3) of
the Merger Agreement.   Section 3.02 Payment of the Purchase Price. The
Purchase Price shall be payable by Parent in cash by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to a bank account to be designated by the
Stockholder in a written notice to Parent at least two Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (as defined below).   Section 3.03 Exercise of Option.  
(a) If either (i) a Termination Fee has been paid or is payable pursuant to
Section 10.3 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated
as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) to the Offer and at or prior to the time of such
termination it has become publicly known that a Takeover Proposal has been
made or (iii) if a Subsequent Amendment (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
is received by the Company or becomes publicly known, then each of the
Options shall become exercisable by Parent for a period (the "Option Exercise
Period") commencing on the earlier of the date on which a Subsequent
Amendment is received by Company or becomes publicly known and the date on
which the Merger Agreement is terminated and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York
time) on the 30th day following the date on which the Merger Agreement
is terminated (the day on which the Option Exercise Period ends, the
"Option Termination Date"). The    3    Options shall be exercisable
in whole but not in part, and in no event shall Parent be permitted to
exercise an Option with respect to the Shares unless Parent concurrently
exercises all Options to purchase the shares of Common Stock subject to each
Transaction Support Agreement from all stockholders who have executed a
Transaction Support Agreement.   (b) If Parent wishes to exercise the
Options during the Option Exercise Period, Parent shall send a written notice
(the "Exercise Notice") to the Stockholder of its intention to exercise
the Stockholder\'s Option, specifying the place, and, if then known, the time
and the date (the "Closing Date") of the closing of such purchase (the
"Closing"). The Closing Date shall, subject to satisfaction of the conditions
in paragraph (d), occur on the later of (i) the third Business Day after the
date on which such Exercise Notice is delivered and (ii) one Business Day
following the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act applicable to the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares
hereunder.   (c) At the Closing, (i) the Stockholder shall deliver to
Parent (or its designee) the Shares by delivery of a certificate
or certificates evidencing such Shares duly endorsed to Parent or accompanied
by stock powers duly executed in favor of Parent, with all necessary
stock transfer stamps affixed, and (ii) Parent shall pay for the Shares in
accordance with Section 3.02.   (d) The Closing shall be subject to
the satisfaction or, in the case of clause (iii) below, waiver by the
Stockholder of each of the following conditions:   (i) no Governmental
Authority shall  have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any 
Law that is then in effect and no order of any Governmental  Authority shall
have been entered or be in effect, in either  case that has the effect of
making the acquisition of the  Shares by Parent illegal or otherwise
restricting, preventing  or prohibiting consummation of the purchase and sale
of the  Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Options; and   (ii) any
waiting period under the HSR  Act applicable to the consummation of the
purchase and sale  of the Shares hereunder shall have expired or been 
terminated.   (e) At the Closing, (i) the Stockholder will deliver good and
valid title to the Shares free and clear of any Liens and, upon delivery to
Parent of such Shares and payment for the Purchase Price therefor as
contemplated herein, Parent will receive good, valid and marketable title to
the Shares free and clear of any Liens, and (ii) Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholder the Purchase Price.    4     ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS

Agreement.   Section 4.03 Ownership of Shares. As of the date hereof, the
