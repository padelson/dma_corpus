SECTION 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers shall sell and assign to the
Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and assume from the Sellers, in each case
free and clear of any Encumbrances, the Purchased Units and the Blocker
Corporation Shares, in exchange for payment by the Buyer of the Purchase Price
as provided in this Article.

SECTION 2.2 _Closing_. The sale of the Purchased Units and Blocker Corporation
Shares shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the

York City time, (a) on the later of (i) December 18th, 2015 and (ii) the
third Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties set
forth in Article IX (other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or (b) at such other place, date or time as the parties hereto
may mutually agree in writing. The day on which the Closing takes place is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

SECTION 2.3 _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers, to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") pursuant to a form of paying agent agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers to be entered into between the Paying Agent and
the Buyer, for payment of the portion of the Purchase Price then due to the
Sellers and the Warrant Holders pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 2.9(g) and such
other amounts that may be payable to the Sellers and Warrant Holders pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Such funds provided
to the Paying Agent are referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_." All fees
and expenses due to the Paying Agent in connection with the services provided
pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be
borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers.

 



19 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of
the Buyer, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for
any amount properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

 

(c) The Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to invest the Payment Fund in a
money market fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, the principal of which is to be invested solely in obligations issued
or guaranteed by the United States Government and repurchase agreements in
respect of such obligations.

 

SECTION 2.4 _Closing Estimates and Calculations_. (a) No later than the third
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Company shall

(i) a good-faith estimate of Closing Non-Cash Working Capital;

 

(ii) a good-faith estimate of Closing Cash;

 

(iii) (A) a good faith estimate of all Indebtedness, Specified Indebtedness,

in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer providing for the
satisfaction and discharge on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect
of all such Funded Indebtedness (including all principal, interest, fees,
premiums, prepayment penalties and other amounts due upon the
extinguishment thereof), including the termination of all related commitments
and the release of all related guarantees and Encumbrances, effective upon the
payment of the payoff amounts listed therein on the Closing Date;

 

(iv) (A) a list of all Third Party Expenses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that remain unpaid as of the Closing, and (B) written invoices
and associated wire instructions from each payee of such Third Party Expenses
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer listing the full
amount of such payees Third Party Expenses that are accrued or due and

in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (whether rendered prior to
or after the Closing) shall be paid in full;

(v) a list of all payees of Change of Control Payments that are payable by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if any, the amount of such Change of
Control Payments payable to each such payee, wire instructions for each such
payee, and, if any such Change of Control Payment is not payable until after
the Closing, the time at which such Change of Control Payment is payable;

 

(vi) a good faith estimate of the EPU Escrow Amount;

 



20 (vii) a good faith estimate of all Pre-Closing Severance Expenses;

 

(viii) (A) using the foregoing estimates and other amounts, a reasonably

Schedule_ ") that updates in full the information in the Signing
Capitalization Schedule, using the estimates set forth in clause (A) in lieu
of the estimates used in the preparation of the Signing Capitalization
Schedule and taking into account any changes that to the information
previously disclosed in the Signing Capitalization Schedule; and

 

(ix) a certification of the Companys co-Chief Executive Officers that the
Closing Estimates and Calculations have been prepared in good faith and in
accordance with this Agreement.

(b) After the Measurement Time and prior to the Closing, the Company

directly or indirectly, any Cash, (ii) pay any Third-Party Expenses, or (iii)
incur any Indebtedness.

(c) The Closing Estimates and Calculations shall be subject to the Buyers
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the approved Closing
Estimates and Calculations shall be used for purposes of determining the
amounts paid hereunder on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Buyers approval of such amounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the
Buyers remedies under this Agreement or constitute an acknowledgement by the
Buyer of the accuracy thereof. In connection therewith, the Sellers and the
Company shall provide the Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable
access to its books and records relevant to the determination of the Closing
Estimates and Calculations.

 

(d) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely in all respects on the Closing
Estimates and Calculations (including the Closing Capitalization Schedule) in
making all payments due under this Agreement, and the Buyer shall not be
responsible or have any liability to any Person (including any direct or
indirect equity holder in the Company) for any inaccuracy thereof.

 

SECTION 2.5 _Treatment of the Sale_. For U.S. federal income and other
applicable Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat the acquisition of the
Purchased Units of the Company pursuant to this Agreement (a) as a sale or
exchange of partnership interests under Sections 741, 743 and 751 of the Code,
and (b) as resulting in the termination of the Company as a partnership
pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, causing the taxable year of the
Company to close as of the end of the day on the Closing Date. For U.S.
federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat
the sale of the Blocker Corporation Shares of the Blocker Corporations
pursuant to this Agreement as a sale under Section 1001 of the Code. For U.S.
federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat
the Founder Restricted Shares as acquisition consideration received by the
Founders and Founder Affiliates in exchange for their Units and not as
compensation. None of the parties shall take any position (whether on any Tax
Returns, in a Tax Controversy, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with this
Section, unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 



21 SECTION 2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Buyer, the Company and the
Sellers each agree that the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs)
shall be allocated in accordance with Schedule 2.6. The Sellers Representative
shall, as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within ninety (90)
days) after the Closing and prior to the filing of any Tax Return which
includes information related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) propose a specific allocation of the Purchase Price amongst the
acquired assets in accordance with Schedule 2.6 (the " _Proposed Purchase
Price Allocation_ ") to the Buyer. The Buyer shall propose to the Sellers
Representative any changes (such proposal, an " _Allocation Objection Notice_
") to the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation within thirty (30) days of the
receipt thereof. Upon the receipt by Sellers Representative of an Allocation
Objection Notice, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements in the Proposed Purchase Price Allocation for a period of
thirty (30) days. To the extent the parties are unable to reach agreement with
respect to the Allocation Objection Notice in such thirty (30) day period, the
items in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Accountant to be resolved
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.9, which resolution
shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. All Tax Returns filed by the
Sellers, the Buyer and the Company shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation (whether as a result of
no Allocation Objection Notice being provided to Sellers Representative, the
parties resolution of an Allocation Objection Notice, or the determination of
the Neutral Accountant), unless otherwise required by applicable Law. In the
event of an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Sellers Representative will
deliver to the Buyer an adjusted Purchase Price Allocation prepared in a
reasonable manner reflecting such adjustment within forty five (45) days
after such adjustment.

SECTION 2.7 _Transactions at the Closing_. (a) At the Closing, the Sellers
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer:

Representative;

22 (b) At or prior to the Closing:

 

(i) Buyer shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds in US dollars, for the
benefit of the Sellers and the Warrant Holders an amount equal to the Closing
Payment; _provided_ , that an amount equal to 20% of the portion of the
Estimated Purchase Price due to the Founders and the Founder Affiliates shall
be deducted from the amount of the Closing Payment and instead be paid by the
Buyer directly to the Founders and the Founder Affiliates in the form of
shares of restricted stock of the Buyer, and valued at the trailing 10 trading
day volume weighted average price of the Buyers stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Issue Price_ "), _provided_ , that in no event shall the Issue
Price be permitted to exceed 115%, or be less than 85%, of the closing price
of the Buyers stock on the NYSE on the date hereof (such shares, the "
_Founder Restricted Shares_ "); and

 

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers and the Warrant Holders a
counterpart to the Escrow Agreement.

held in Indemnity Escrow Fund;

 

(v) the Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Amount to the Escrow

in the EPU Escrow Fund.

(d) _EPUs_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Company or to the
Companys payroll service provider, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in US dollars, for the benefit of the EPU Holders, an amount equal to
the Closing EPU Obligation. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company shall pay or cause the Companys payroll service provider to pay, as
applicable, the Closing EPU Obligation to the EPU Holders in accordance with
the Closing Capitalization Schedule, less applicable employee tax
withholdings, 

 



23  subject to, in the case of payment to any EPU Holder and only to the extent
required by the terms and conditions of such EPU Holders EPUs, such EPU
Holders execution of a release (an " _EPU Holder Release_ ") of liability of
any and all claims against the Company, its officers, directors and members,
the Sellers and the Sellers Representative in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the parties hereto.

 

(e) _Warrants_.

 

(i) At the Closing:

 

(A) each "out-of-the-money" Warrant, if any, outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing shall be cancelled without any payment therefor; and

(B) each "in-the-money" Warrant, if any, outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing shall be deemed exercised and each holder of such a Warrant shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash determined based on
the assumption that such Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the
Closing on a "cash-less" basis. The amounts described in this Section shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such "in-the-money" Warrants.

(ii) The Company shall take all action necessary (including obtaining the
consent of any holder of a Company Warrant) to ensure that the Warrants shall
be treated as contemplated by this Section. The Company shall provide all
notices to holders of Warrants required by any Contracts related to the
Warrants. After the Closing, the Sellers shall ensure that no holder of a
Warrant shall have any rights to acquire the capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any other rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the payment contemplated by this paragraph (if any) in
cancellation and termination thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
Buyers obligations hereunder (including the Buyers obligation to pay the
Purchase Price), the Buyer shall be entitled at the Closing to direct that any
of the Units be transferred by the Sellers to one or more of the Buyers
Affiliates in lieu of any such transfer to the Buyer itself.

 

(g) The Buyers obligation to pay the Purchase Price shall be deemed satisfied
upon the Buyers (i) payment to the Paying Agent, the Closing Payment and, if
applicable, any amounts required to be paid by the Buyer to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.9, (ii) delivery to the Founders and Founder Affiliates
of the Founder Restricted Shares and (iii) payment to the Company, for
distribution to the EPU Holders pursuant to Section 2.7(d), the Closing EPU
Obligation and, if applicable, any amounts required to be paid by the Buyer to
the Company for distribution to the EPU Holders pursuant to Section 2.9, and
the Buyer shall not be responsible to any Person with respect to the division
of such proceeds among the Sellers, Warrant Holders and EPU Holders.

 



24 (h) The Buyer shall instruct the Paying Agent to, promptly following the
Closing, pay each Seller and Warrant Holder his, her or its proportionate
share of the Closing Payment, as such share is set forth in the Closing
Capitalization Schedule.

 

SECTION 2.8 _EPU Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing EPU Payments_. In the event that the Company is required
pursuant to the terms of any EPUs to make any payments to EPU Holders that
hold unvested EPUs as of the Closing and that are terminated without cause
within the first six months following the Closing (" _Post-Closing EPU
Obligations_ "), (i) it shall, or the Buyer shall cause the Company to, (i)
promptly notify the Sellers Representative of the requirement to make payments
pursuant to such Post-Closing EPU Obligation(s), the identity of the EPU
Holder or EPU Holders that are entitled to such payments, the circumstances
under which such payments were required to be made, and the Company or the
Buyers calculation of the amount of such payments, and shall provide the
Sellers Representative with any additional information that the Sellers
Representative may reasonably require in connection with such payments,
including to determine the accuracy of such calculations, (ii) the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse
from the EPU Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Company, for distribution to the applicable EPU Holders (less applicable
employee tax withholdings), the amount of payments that are required to be
made to the applicable EPU Holders pursuant to the Post-Closing EPU
Obligations (which calculation shall include an appropriate deduction pursuant
to the terms of the EPUs to reflect the portion of the Post-Closing EPU
Obligations that are not then payable due to a portion of the Purchase Price
having originally been deposited in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund if the payment to the EPU Holders is to be
made prior to the termination of the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund and to
reflect the portion, if any, of the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund paid
to the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.9(f) if the payment to the EPU Holders is
to be made after the termination of the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund.
Within fourteen (14) days following the payment of any Post-Closing EPU
Payments to any EPU Holders, the Sellers Representative shall in good faith
recalculate the EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share for each Seller, Warrant Holder
and EPU Holder to reflect the effect of such Post-Closing EPU Payments and
deliver a certificate executed by an authorized representative to the Buyer
and the Escrow Agent setting forth all of the recalculated EPU Adjusted Pro
Rata Shares.

 

(b) _Termination of EPU Escrow Fund_. Upon the termination of the EPU Escrow
Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall,
pursuant to instructions received from the Sellers Representative no more than
three Business Days after the termination of the EPU Escrow Fund, pay any
amounts remaining in the EPU Escrow Fund to (i) the Paying Agent,
for distribution to the Sellers and the Warrant Holders in accordance with
each Sellers and each Warrant Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share, it being
understood and agreed that the allocation of distributions among such Sellers
and Warrant Holders shall be the responsibility of the Sellers Representative
only and that the Buyer and the Company shall cooperate with the Sellers
Representative as reasonably requested in connection with such distributions,
_provided_ that neither the Buyer nor the Company shall have any obligation
to ensure that the allocation of distributions among the Sellers and Warrant
Holders is accurate, and (ii) the Company, for distribution to the EPU
Holders, less applicable employee tax withholdings, in accordance with each
EPU Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share, it being

 



25  understood and agreed that such distribution from the Escrow Agent to the
Company shall be the responsibility of the Sellers Representative only and
that the Buyer and the Company shall cooperate with the Sellers
Representative as reasonably requested in connection with such distribution,
_provided_ that neither the Buyer nor the Company shall have any obligation to
ensure that the allocation of distributions among the EPU Holders
is accurate.

SECTION 2.9 _Purchase Price True-Up_. (a) Within 90 days after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a

Calculations (including Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Adjusted Closing Specified Indebtedness, Adjusted
Closing Indebtedness, Change of Control Payments, Third Party Expenses, the
Closing EPU Obligation, Pre-Closing Severance Payments and the Purchase
Price), and the deviation of such amounts from those included in the Closing
Estimates and Calculations ( _provided_ , that the Buyer shall not have to
provide a Closing Capitalization Schedule or otherwise determine how the
Purchase Price is allocated among the Sellers, the EPU Holders and the
Warrant Holders).

(b) On the 30th day following the delivery of the Closing Statement to the
Sellers Representative, the Closing Statement shall become final and binding
on all parties hereto unless, on or prior to such 30th day, the Sellers
Representative shall have delivered to the Buyer a statement describing
in reasonable detail the nature, amount and basis of each objection of the
Sellers Representative to the Closing Statement (and any amount or calculation
not so objected to shall become final and binding on all parties hereto).
During such 30-day period, the Sellers Representative and its advisors
(including its accountants) shall be permitted to review the working papers of
the Buyer and its advisors (including its accountants) relating to the Closing
Statement.

 

(c) If the Sellers Representative timely objects to the Closing Statement,
such objections shall be resolved as set forth below. In
connection therewith, the Buyer and its advisors (including its accountants)
shall be permitted to review the working papers of the Sellers Representative
and its advisors (including their accountants) relating to such objections.

 

(i) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall first use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections in good faith.

(ii) If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative are able to resolve such
objections within 30 days after delivery of such statement of objections, the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative, within such 30-day period, shall jointly
prepare and sign a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of all amounts included in the Closing Estimates and Calculations
(including Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Adjusted Closing Specified Indebtedness, Adjusted Closing
Indebtedness, Change of Control Payments, Third Party Expenses, the Closing
EPU Obligation, Pre-Closing Severance Payments and the Purchase Price), and
the deviation of such amounts from those included in the Closing Estimates and
Calculations, which such calculations shall be final and binding on all
parties hereto.

 



26 (iii) If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative do not reach a resolution
of all objections set forth in such statement of objections within 30 days
after delivery of such statement of objections, the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall, within 15 days after the expiration of such 30-day
period, (A) jointly prepare and sign a statement setting forth those
objections (if any) that the Buyer and the Sellers Representative have
resolved and the resolution of such objections, which resolutions shall be
final and binding on all parties hereto, (B) jointly prepare and sign a
statement setting forth those objections which remain unresolved
(collectively, the " _Unresolved Objections_ "), and (C) jointly engage the
Neutral Accountant to resolve the Unresolved Objections.

(iv) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall jointly submit to the
Neutral Accountant, within 5 days after the date of the engagement of the
Neutral Accountant, a copy of the Closing Statement, a copy of the statement
of objections delivered by the Sellers Representative, and the joint statement
of Unresolved Objections referred to in paragraph (iii) above. Each of the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall submit to the Neutral Accountant
(with a copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 15 days after the
date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum (which may
include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Objections. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative may
(but shall not be required to) submit to the Neutral Accountant (with a
copy delivered to the other on the same day), within 30 days after the date
of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum responding to the
initial memorandum submitted to the Neutral Accountant by the other. Unless
requested by the Neutral Accountant in writing, neither the Buyer nor the
Sellers Representative may present any additional information or arguments to
the Neutral Accountant, either orally or in writing.

 

(v) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Neutral Accountant to (A) ensure the scope of its review
and authority shall be limited to solely resolving the Unresolved Objections,
(B) act in accordance with this Agreement, and (C) issue a written ruling
which sets forth the resolution of each Unresolved Objection and includes a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations of all amounts
included in the Closing Estimates and Calculations (including Closing Non-Cash
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Adjusted Closing
Specified Indebtedness, Adjusted Closing Indebtedness, Change of Control
Payments, Third Party Expenses, the Closing EPU Obligation, Pre-Closing
Severance Payments and the Purchase Price), and the deviation of such amounts
from those included in the Closing Estimates and Calculations, each
reflecting the Neutral Accountants resolution of the Unresolved Objections.
The resolution of each Unresolved Objection shall consist of the determination
of an appropriate value for each Closing Statement item that is the subject
of an Unresolved Objection, which value shall be equal to one of, or between,
the values proposed by the Sellers Representative and by the Buyer.

 

(vi) The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral Accountant to render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to it within 30 days following the
submission

 



27  thereof. The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the Unresolved
Objections shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto and shall not be
subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud. The Buyer and the
Sellers Representative agree that the procedure set forth in this Section for
resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving any such disputes, _provided_  that no party
shall be prohibited from instituting any Action to enforce the resolution of
the Neutral Accountant in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(d) The fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be paid by
the Buyer and the Sellers in relation to the proportional difference between
the Neutral Accountants final determination of the Purchase Price and the
Sellers Representatives and the Buyers determination of the Purchase Price,
as reflected in the Closing Statement or in the Sellers Representatives
statement of objections, as applicable. The fees, costs and expenses of the
accountants, attorneys and other representatives of each party incurred in
connection with the matters described in this Section shall be borne by
such party. For the avoidance of doubt any such fees borne by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this paragraph shall be satisfied exclusively by a
disbursement from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund and, solely to the
extent the then remaining balance of the Sellers Representative Expense Fund
is insufficient to fully satisfy such payment obligation, from the Purchase
Price True-Up Escrow Fund and then, if the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund
is exhausted, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(e) Each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall assist, and Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates to assist, the other party and its advisors
(including its accountants) in the preparation and review of the Closing
Statement and in connection with the other matters addressed by this Section.
Buyer shall afford to the Sellers Representative and its advisors (including
its accountants), reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours, to the personnel, properties, books and records of Buyer and
the Company and their respective Affiliates to the extent relevant to such
matters; _provided_  that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of such Persons. Sellers Representative shall afford to
Buyer and its advisors (including its accountants), reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, to the personnel and working
files (including those books and records of the Sellers, or copies thereof, as
are included in such working files) of Sellers Representative to the extent
relevant to the Sellers Representatives preparation and review of the
Closing Statement and provided that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of such Persons.

(f) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to this Section, is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Sellers Representative and
the Buyer shall, within three Business Days of such final determination,
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price True-Up
Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) to the Buyer,
the amount of such difference, and (ii) thereafter, to (x) the Paying Agent,
for distribution to the Sellers and Warrant Holders in accordance with each
Sellers and each Warrant Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share (pursuant to
instructions received from the Sellers Representative at least three Business
Days prior to such date), and (y) to the Company, for distribution to the EPU
Holders, less applicable employee tax withholdings, in accordance with each
EPU Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share, any remaining amounts in the
Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund (if any). The Sellers and Warrant Holders
shall be jointly and

 



28  severally liable to the Buyer if the amount of the Purchase Price True-Up
Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy the Buyers right of payment
under this paragraph, _provided_ , that the Buyer shall have the option,
exercisable at its discretion, to recover any such shortfall from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund before seeking to recover directly from the Sellers.

 

(g) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to this Section, is
greater than the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, then within three Business
Days of such final determination, (i) the Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to (x) the Paying Agent, for distribution to the
Sellers and Warrant Holders in accordance with each Sellers and each Warrant
Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share (pursuant to allocation instructions
received from the Sellers Representative at least three Business Days prior to
such date), and (y) to the Company, for distribution to the EPU Holders, less
applicable employee tax withholdings, in accordance with each EPU Holders EPU
Adjusted Pro Rata Share, the amount of such difference and (ii) the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to disburse from the Purchase Price True-Up Escrow Fund by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (x) to the Paying Agent, for distribution to the
Sellers, EPU Holders and Warrant Holders, in accordance with each Sellers and
Warrant Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share (pursuant to allocation
instructions received from the Sellers Representative at least three Business
Days prior to such date), and (y) to the Company, for distribution to the EPU
Holders, less applicable employee tax withholdings, in accordance with each
EPU Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share, the entirety of the Purchase Price
True-Up Escrow Fund.

 

(h) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to treat any payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.9 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required under applicable Law.

SECTION 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any Tax Law. To the extent that
such amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.11 _Sellers Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller and each Warrant Holder, by his, her or its execution of this
Agreement or acceptance of the Purchase Price, hereby consents to the terms
of this Section and to the appointment of Shareholder Representative Services
LLC as such Persons representative and attorney-in-fact (the " _Sellers
Representative_ "), with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the
Sellers and Warrant Holders to the extent and in the manner set forth in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Sellers Representative with respect to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including all decisions, actions, consents and instructions relating
to the defense or settlement of any claims for indemnification, shall be
binding upon all Sellers and Warrant Holders, and no Seller nor any such
Warrant Holder shall have the right to object to, protest or otherwise contest
any such decision, action, consent or instruction. The Buyer shall be entitled
to rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction of

 



29  the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as being the
decision, action, consent or instruction of the Sellers and Warrant Holders,
and the Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts
done by them in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or
instruction. The provisions of this Section, including the power of attorney
granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more
Sellers or any one or more of the Warrant Holders, or by operation of Law,
whether by death or other event.

(b) The Sellers Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Sellers and Warrant
Holders holding a projected interest in the Purchase Price equal to or greater
than a majority of the projected Purchase Price (the " _Majority Holders_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall the Sellers Representative be
removed without the Majority Holders having first appointed a new Sellers
Representative who shall assume such duties immediately upon the removal of
the Sellers Representative. In the event of the death, incapacity,
resignation or removal of the Sellers Representative, a new Sellers
Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the
Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Sellers Representative shall be sent to the Buyer, such
appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such notice is received by the Buyer; _provided_ , that
until such notice is received, the Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to
rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the prior Sellers
Representative as described in paragraph (a) above, unless such Sellers
Representative has resigned or has died or has become incapacitated, in which
case the Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to rely on the decisions,
actions, consents and instructions of a majority of the Advisory Committee
members then serving who, in such case, for all purposes hereunder shall
be deemed the Sellers Representative until the Majority Holders appoint a
replacement for the prior Sellers Representative. All fees and expenses
incurred by the Sellers Representative in performing its duties hereunder
(including legal fees and expenses related thereto) (other than the Sellers
Representatives engagement fee specified in its engagement letter, which
shall be a Third Party Expense) and any indemnification in favor of the
Sellers Representative shall be borne solely by the Sellers and the Warrant
Holders. The Sellers Representative shall seek to recover all such amounts
first from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund before pursuing recovery
directly against the Sellers or Warrant Holders.

 

(c) The Sellers Representative and the members of the Advisory Committee shall
not be liable to the Sellers or Warrant Holders for actions taken or omitted
in connection with the Sellers Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in connection with the members service
on the Advisory Committee, respectively, except to the extent any
such liability shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have directly resulted from the intentional fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers Representative or a member of
the Advisory Committee, respectively. The Sellers and the Warrant Holders
shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
Representative and the members of the Advisory Committee (solely in their
capacity as members of the Advisory Committee) from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of
attorneys and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, 

 



30  duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ")
arising out of and in connection with the Sellers Representatives activities
as Sellers Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
the members service on the Advisory Committee, respectively, in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the
event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Sellers Representative or an Advisory Committee Member, as applicable, the
Sellers Representative or such Advisory Committee Member, as applicable, will
reimburse the Sellers and Warrant Holders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Sellers Representative
or the members of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, by the Sellers and
Warrant Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Sellers Representative or the members of the Advisory Committee, as
applicable, from (i) the funds in the Sellers Representative Expense Fund and
(ii) the other escrow amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement at such
time (and only at such time) as such remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Sellers and/or Warrant Holders under the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that while this section
allows the Sellers Representative and the members of the Advisory Committee to
be paid from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund and the other escrow
amounts held by the Escrow Agent, this does not relieve the Sellers and
Warrant Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Sellers
Representative or the members of the Advisory Committee from seeking any
remedies available to them at law or otherwise. In no event will the Sellers
Representative or member of the Advisory Committee (except in such members
capacity as a Seller and to the same extent and degree as the other Sellers
hereunder) be required to advance his, her or its own funds on behalf of the
Sellers or Warrant Holders or otherwise. The Sellers and Warrant Holders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Sellers Representative or any Advisory Committee
Member or the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
restrictions or limitations regarding the liability of the Sellers and
Warrant Holders contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
apply to the indemnities provided to the Sellers Representative and the
Advisory Committee Members under this Section 2.11(c).

 

(d) By his, her or its execution of this Agreement or acceptance of the
Purchase Price, each Seller and each Warrant Holder shall be deemed to have
approved of all arrangements pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to
the provisions hereof binding upon the Sellers and the Warrant Holders,
including the indemnification provisions hereof.

(e) The Sellers Representative Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Sellers Representative for, any third
party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. For tax
purposes, the Sellers Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Sellers and Warrant Holders at
the Closing.

SECTION 2.12 _Waiver; Termination of Agreements_. Each Seller and each
Warrant Holder, by his, her or its execution of this Agreement or acceptance
of the Purchase Price, hereby waives (i) any required notice, if any, to which
such Person is entitled (including

 



31  under the Companys governing documents, the Equity Documents, the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and any Contract or other Law
pursuant to which such Person may have rights or be bound) in connection with
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; (ii) any period of time that is
required to elapse (including under the Companys governing documents, the
Equity Documents, the DGCL and any Contract or other Law pursuant to which
such Person may have rights or be bound) before the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, if any; and (iii) any and all
pre-emptive rights, rights of first refusal, co-sale or other rights it may
have under the Equity Documents as a result of, or in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Effective as of immediately
prior to the Closing, without any further action by any party hereto, each
Equity Document other than the Company Operating Agreement and the agreements
governing the EPUs are hereby terminated in their entirety and no party
thereto shall have any further rights or obligations thereunder.

with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any Tax Return with
respect to a Straddle Period). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. No later than 20 days prior to the due date for any such filing
(including any applicable extensions), the Sellers Representative will deliver
to the Buyer and the Company such Tax Returns for the Buyers review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed). The Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period. Such Tax Returns shall be submitted to the Sellers Representative no
later than 20 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including any
applicable extensions) for the Sellers Representatives review and approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

(b) The Sellers Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared (and the
applicable Blocker Corporation shall subsequently file), within the time and
manner prescribed by applicable Law, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
or on behalf of each Blocker Corporation after the Closing with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle
Period). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law. No later than 20
days prior to the due date for any such filing (including any applicable
extensions), the Sellers Representative will deliver to the Buyer and the
Company such Tax Returns for the Buyers review and approval (such approval
not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). The Buyer shall
prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the
Blocker Corporations with respect to any Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns
shall be submitted to the Sellers Representative no later than 20 days prior

Parent and FTV Blocker Corporation Parent shall be responsible for all costs
and expenses for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns of Elevation
Blocker Corporation and FTV Blocker Corporation, respectively, required to be

(c) Buyer and the Sellers agree that all items of income and deductions
attributable to the business of the Transferred Companies conducted through
the end of the Closing Date (including any deductions attributable to
transaction costs paid or incurred by the Sellers or the Transferred
Companies, any deductions attributable to liabilities included in the
calculation of Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, and any deductions
attributable to payments made to an EPU Holder pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, but excluding income and deductions that arise from actions taken
by or under the direction of Buyer on the Closing Date that are not in the
ordinary course of business) will be included on the final Tax Return of the
Company or the relevant Blocker Corporation ending on the Closing Date, as
applicable, except as otherwise required under applicable Law.

 



79 (d) The Buyer, the Sellers Representative, the Blocker Corporations, the
Blocker Corporation Parents and the Company shall reasonably cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates and its and their Representatives to
reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all Taxable periods or relating to
Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with Taxes. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer will (and will cause the Company to) cooperate with the
Sellers Representative to enable the Sellers Representative to utilize the
Companys existing Tax Return preparation firm(s) (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
Such cooperation may include providing access to books and records and
accounting staff, and delegating authority to the Sellers Representative under
the Accounting Firms engagement agreement sufficient for the Accounting Firm
to take direction from the Sellers Representative, or otherwise ensuring that
the Sellers Representative will have access to (and the ability to direct,
even if indirectly through the Company) the Accounting Firm. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company will cause all Tax Returns prepared in accordance
with Sections 8.1(a) and (b) to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period (x)
the amount of any Taxes that are based on or measured by income, receipts or
expenditures of the relevant entity and that are allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of the date on the Closing Date; and (y) the amount of all other
Taxes of the relevant entity that are allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any Taxes that are attributable to any transaction that is engaged in by
Buyer after the Closing and on the Closing Date, and that is not contemplated
by this Agreement and that is not otherwise in the ordinary course of business
(including any election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code), shall
be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 8.2 _Tax Controversies_.

 

(a) After the Closing, the Buyer or the Company shall notify the Sellers
Representative of any Tax audits, Tax disputes or administrative, judicial or
other proceedings (" _Tax Controversies_ ") that relate to any Taxes of the
Transferred Companies for which the Sellers may be liable under this Agreement
or that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period within 30 days following the
Buyers or the Companys or the Blocker Corporations receipt of the written
claim from any Taxing Authority; _provided_ that any failure to provide such
notification shall not have any impact on Sellers
indemnification obligations with respect to Seller Taxes or Blocker
Corporation Parent Taxes except to the extent that the Sellers are materially
prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) After the Closing, the Sellers Representative shall have the right to
control any Tax Controversies that relate to any Taxes of the Transferred
Companies for which the Sellers may be liable under this Agreement or that
relate solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, to employ counsel and other
advisors of its choice at the expense of the Sellers and Warrant Holders and
to control the conduct of such Tax Controversy, including settlement or other

 



80  disposition thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have the
right to participate in (but not control) such Tax Controversy. Buyers right
to participate shall include, but not be limited to, hiring, at its own
expense, its own counsel and the right to review on any written submission in
respect of such Tax Controversy (prior to submission) and to attend any
hearing, conference, meeting or call regarding such Tax Controversy. Sellers
Representative may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect
to such Tax Controversies, and may initiate any claim for refund or direct
the Company or any Blocker Corporation to file any amended return (subject to
the Buyers consent as set forth in Section 8.1 with respect to Pre-Closing
Tax Returns), and the Company and each Blocker Corporation shall promptly file
any such amended returns. Sellers Representative shall not settle or resolve
any Tax Controversy without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed (for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be entitled to withhold consent if such
Tax Controversy does not adversely affect the Buyer or the Transferred
Companies in any post-Closing tax period).

 

(c) In the event that after the Closing the Sellers Representative does not
exercise its right to control a Tax Controversy pursuant to this Section,
after the Closing, the Buyer shall control such Tax Controversy at its expense
and in its sole and absolute discretion. Buyers control of any Tax
Controversy pursuant to this provision shall not have any impact on
Sellers indemnification obligations with respect to Seller Taxes, Elevation
Blocker Corporation Parent Taxes or FTV Blocker Corporation Parent Taxes.

 

SECTION 8.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes arising from or attributable
to the sale of the Purchased Units will be borne equally by the Buyer and the
Sellers (other than the Blocker Corporation Parents), and any Transfer Taxes
arising from or attributable to the sale of the Blocker Corporation Shares of
a Blocker Corporation will be borne equally by the Buyer and the
Blocker Corporation Parent of such Blocker Corporation. The person(s)
required to do so by applicable Law will file or cause to be filed in a timely
manner all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes.

 

SECTION 8.4 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Elevation Blocker Corporation Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer, Elevation Blocker Corporation and their Affiliates
against any and all Elevation Blocker Corporation Taxes. The indemnification

Taxes, as and when notified of the amount of such Taxes by the Buyer or
Elevation Blocker Corporation.

(b) FTV Blocker Corporation Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
Buyer, FTV Blocker Corporation and their Affiliates against any and all FTV
Blocker Corporation Taxes. The indemnification required hereunder for FTV

Corporation Parent of the amount of such Taxes, as and when notified of the
amount of such Taxes by the Buyer or FTV Blocker Corporation.

 



81 (c) The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, Buyer, the Company,
and their Affiliates against any and all Seller Taxes. The indemnification
required hereunder for Seller Taxes shall be made by prompt payment by Sellers
of the amount of such Taxes, as and when notified of the amount of such Taxes
by the Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the right to seek indemnity
directly from the Sellers for any Seller Taxes, Buyer and the Company agree
that, to the extent sufficient funds are held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, it
shall first seek indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow Fund for the first
$1,000,000 of Seller Taxes prior to making a claim directly against the
Sellers.

(d) The obligations of this Section shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 10.9, but shall not be subject to any other provisions of Article X.

 

SECTION 8.5 _Section 754 Election_. The Sellers, the Blocker Corporations,
and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries to, each (a) make an election under Section 754 of the Code,
effective on or prior to the Closing, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) take all such other actions necessary
to give effect to such election.

SECTION 8.6 _Statute of Limitations_. Blocker Corporation Tax Returns. After
the Closing Date, Buyer shall take no actions (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law), whether on a Tax Return or otherwise, which would result in
an extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the
written consent of the Sellers Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer and its Affiliates,
including the Blocker Corporations, will not file any Tax Return or amended
Tax Return of a Blocker Corporation with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the consent of the applicable Blocker Corporation Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(v) no party shall have any liability to any other party under this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements or with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby for any punitive damages (other than any such punitive
damages payable to a third Person under a Third Party Claim).

 

SECTION 10.5 _Exclusive Monetary Remedy; Nature of Payments; Materiality
Qualifications_. (a) Except as provided in Section 2.11(c) and 12.12, the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the parties after the Closing with
respect to any claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement (other than
with respect to FTV Blocker Corporation Taxes or Elevation Blocker
Corporation Taxes) or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for
damages it may have against any other party arising under this Agreement or
any schedule, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article and
Section 8.4. The provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply to any
claims relating to or arising out of the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(b) The parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this Article as
an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes to the extent
permitted by Law.

(c) Both for purposes of determining breach and for calculating the amount of
any Loss arising from a breach of any representation or warranty subject to
indemnification under Section 10.2(a) or 10.2(b) (excluding the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.7(d), 4.7(e), 4.8,
4.9(b), 4.10(c), 4.12(a)(v), 4.15(a), 4.16(b), 4.16(r), 4.18(a)(xiv)(D),
4.18(a)(xvi), and 4.18(a)(xx)), all "material," "materially," "in all material
respects," "Company Material Adverse Effect," and other like qualifications
shall be disregarded.

 



87 (d) The Buyers right to indemnification hereunder or other remedy for any
Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by any Knowledge of the Buyer or any of its Representatives
in respect thereof prior to the date of this Agreement or prior to the
Closing.

SECTION 10.6 _Procedures_. (a) In order for a party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a
claim or demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof
to the Sellers (by means of delivery to the Sellers Representative) or the
Buyer, as applicable (the Sellers or the Buyer in such case are referred to
herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim
and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party
Claim with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is required hereunder to
indemnify the Indemnified Party, and shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim unless first consented to in the sole
discretion of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not enter
into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(c) Sellers Representative shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim from the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and the expense of the Sellers and Warrant
Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall not
be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable or
injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal liability or
damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim. If Sellers
Representative elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, then:

 

(i) The Buyer shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in (but not control) the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Buyer unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing
by the Sellers Representative or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both Buyer and the
Indemnifying Party, and the Buyer reasonably determines that representation by
counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and the Buyer
may present such counsel with a conflict of interest; and

 



88 (ii) The Buyer shall make reasonably available to Sellers Representative
all pertinent books, records and other documents and materials in Buyers
possession or under its or its Affiliates control as are reasonably required
by the Sellers Representative for the defense of such Third Party Claim, and
shall execute such documents and use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such other actions as Sellers Representative may reasonably request for the
purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or
adjustment relating to, such Third Party Claim, and shall otherwise cooperate
as reasonably requested by Sellers Representative in the defense of such Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Sellers
Representative assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Sellers
Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing,
(ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or
plaintiff of the Buyer and its Affiliates from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation
on the Buyer or any of its Affiliates other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the Buyer and its Affiliates will be indemnified hereunder.

 

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 20 Business
Days of its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes, in
any respect, its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand. If
the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but
asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount
promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the
Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

 

SECTION 10.7 _Mitigation_. Promptly after the Buyer or the Company becomes
aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
constitute any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article
IV, the Buyer or the Company will take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate and minimize any Losses that may result from such breach.

 

SECTION 10.8 _Indemnity Escrow Fund; Setoff_. The Buyer and the other Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund the
amount of any and all Losses to which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Article. The

 



89  Buyer agrees that it shall, and shall cause each other Buyer Indemnitee to,
first seek a remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of the
amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with respect to any
indemnification claim asserted under this Agreement before seeking to recover
any such Losses, if any, that may be recovered directly from the Sellers or
any other Indemnifying Parties, _provided_ _further_ that the Founders and
Founder Affiliates shall satisfy fifty percent (50%) of their indemnity
obligations with respect to an indemnity claim with Founder Restricted Shares,
which Founder Restricted Shares shall be valued at the trailing 10 trading
day volume weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange for the
trading day immediately preceding the date on which such shares are forfeited
in connection with such Founder(s)s indemnity obligation.

 

SECTION 10.9 _Insurance_. The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund or otherwise under this
Article or Section 8.4 shall be calculated net of the amount of (a) any third
party insurance proceeds from any third party insurance actually received by
the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company or its Subsidiaries) in
connection with such Losses or any of the events or circumstances giving rise
or otherwise related to such Losses and (b) any Tax savings attributable to
such losses to the extent such Tax savings are actually realized on a "with
and without" basis in the year in which the Loss occurs or in the following
year. Any amounts paid to Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company or
its Subsidiaries) pursuant to such indemnification under this Article or
Section 8.4 shall be refunded if and only to the extent that the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company or its Subsidiaries) shall later receive any
such insurance proceeds or benefit from such Tax savings, in each case that
were not previously deducted from the amounts paid to Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company or its Subsidiaries) pursuant to the indemnification
under this Article or Section 8.4.

 

SECTION 10.10 _Termination of Indemnification_. (a) The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(i) or
(b)(i) or Section 10.3(a) shall terminate when the applicable representation
or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 10.1, and no claim for any Losses
with respect to any such representation or warranty may be made after such
termination of the applicable representation or warranty and (ii) pursuant to
any other provision of Section 10.2 or 10.3 shall not terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any particular item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable survival
period, previously made a claim in good faith compliance with Section 10.6. 

(b) Upon the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to instructions
received from the Sellers Representative no more than three Business Days
after the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, pay any amounts remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (i) to the Paying Agent for distribution to
the Sellers and the Warrant Holders in accordance with each Sellers or
Warrant Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share (or, in the case of the Founders
and Founder Affiliates, fifty percent (50%) of their respective EPU Adjusted
Pro Rata Shares), it being understood and agreed that such distributions
shall be the responsibility of the Sellers Representative only and that Buyer
and the Company will cooperate with the Sellers Representative in connection
with such distributions,  _provided_ , that neither the Buyer nor the Company
shall have any obligation to ensure that the allocation of distributions among
the

 



90  Sellers and Warrant Holders is accurate, and (ii) to the Company, for
distribution to the EPU Holders, less applicable employee tax withholdings, in
accordance with each EPU Holders EPU Adjusted Pro Rata Share.

(b) no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability or damages
resulting from any pre-termination breach of this Agreement or from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, in which case the non-breaching party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

SECTION 12.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, paragraph, clause or Exhibit, such reference shall be to
an Article, Section, paragraph, clause or Exhibit of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be
of such gender as the circumstances require, and in the singular or plural as
the circumstances require. The Disclosure Schedules and all Exhibits annexed
hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of
this Agreement as if set forth herein. The word "including" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without
limitation," unless otherwise specified. The words "hereof," "hereto,"
"hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word "shall." The words "asset" and "property" shall be deemed to have the
same meaning, and to refer to all assets and properties, whether real or
personal, tangible or intangible. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to any Law include references to any associated rules,
regulations and official guidance with respect thereto. References to a
Person are also to its predecessors, successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" are references to
the lawful money of the United States of America. If any foreign currency
needs to be converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining compliance
with the dollar thresholds in this Agreement, such currency shall be converted
to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates published by The Wall Street Journal
as the New York closing rates for the day in question. References to "days"
mean calendar days unless otherwise specified. Each party hereto has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal doctrine
that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement
against the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

 



94 SECTION 12.6 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not imply any representation, warranty, covenant
or undertaking not expressly given in this Agreement nor shall such disclosure
be taken as extending the scope of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants in this Agreement. The inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not (i) constitute a determination that such matter is
material to the business, assets, results of operations or affairs of the
Company or be deemed to establish a standard of materiality, (ii) constitute
a determination that such matter arose outside the ordinary course of business
or (iii) constitute an admission of liability or obligation to any third
party. Disclosure under any section or sub-section of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed disclosure to each other section or sub-section of
the Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on its face.

 

SECTION 12.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules and the Exhibits hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings and
all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications
and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

SECTION 12.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the EPU Holders are intended
third party beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 10.2(b) of this
Agreement with respect to the obligations of any breaching Seller and (b) the
Debt Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, this Section 12.8, Sections 12.2, 12.10(b), 12.11, 12.14 and 12.16
(in each case, to the extent such sections relate to the Debt Financing
Sources).

SECTION 12.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Ancillary Agreements and
all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied
because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Ancillary Agreement is
expressly governed by the laws of a different jurisdiction, such Ancillary
Agreement and all disputes or controversies to the extent specifically arising
out of such Ancillary Agreement shall be governed by the laws so specified in
such Ancillary Agreement. 

SECTION 12.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. (a) Each of the parties
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby brought by such party or its Affiliates shall
be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of 

 



95  Delaware, _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal action or
proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and its Affiliates and with respect to its and their property,
generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding.
Each of the parties agrees that it shall not and shall cause its Affiliates
not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware. Each of the parties further agrees
that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process
and the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.
Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
in Delaware as described above for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in any such court (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not
be enforced in or by such courts.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity and whether in contract or
tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including but
not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof) in any forum other than the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan
or, in either case, any appellate court from any thereof.

 

SECTION 12.11 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of each other party, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Buyer may: (a) assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of
the Buyer without the prior consent of the Sellers or (b) without consent,
pledge any of its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement
as security to any of its Debt Financing Sources or any agent or collateral
trustee for such Debt Financing Sources; _provided_ _further_ , that no
assignment shall limit the assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



96 SECTION 12.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that each
party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 12.10, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security as
a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

SECTION 12.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 12.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR BY THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES), WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
