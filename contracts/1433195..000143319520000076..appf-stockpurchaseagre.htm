it shall have corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such
as a verb), (x) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other theory extends, and such phrase shall not
mean "if," and (xi) references to any party to this Agreement or any Contract
shall include such party's successors and permitted assigns.

(b) The Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules are incorporated in, and are an
integral part of, this Agreement. Any matter set forth in any section of any
Schedule (or section thereof) shall be deemed to be referred to and
incorporated in any section of this Agreement to which the information set
forth in such Schedule relates, and also in all other sections of the
Schedules and this Agreement to which such matter's application or relevance
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure regardless of whether
such section or subsection is qualified by reference to the Schedules. Any
capitalized terms used in any Annex, Exhibit or Schedule but not otherwise
defined in such Annex, Exhibit or Schedule shall be defined as set forth in
this Agreement.

(c) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the parties. No presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(d) Any statute, rule or regulation defined or referred to in this Agreement
means such statute, rule or regulation, in each case as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession or comparable

other documents or Contracts attached thereto. Any statute defined or referred
to in this Agreement shall include all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(e) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material. No party shall use the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement
or included in any Schedule is or is not required to be disclosed, is or is
not material or could have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of such specific item

or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of Business. No party shall
use the setting forth or the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or included in

Agreement to be included in the Schedules. Such matters may be set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. The information set forth in this Agreement and the Schedules
is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement. No information set
forth in this Agreement or the Schedules shall be deemed to be an admission by
any party to this Agreement to any third party of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of any Law or breach of any Contract. Nothing in the
Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or to create any covenant, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in the Schedules. Whenever this Agreement states
that Seller or the Company has "provided," "furnished," "delivered" or "made
available," any information or document to Buyer, such statement means that
such information or document was delivered to Buyer or its Representatives at
least one day prior to the Signing Date or was made available for viewing by
Buyer and its Representatives at least one day prior to the Signing Date in
the "virtual data room" for "Project Ayala" established by or on behalf of
Seller and hosted by SecureDocs (the "Data Room").

(f) The provision of the Table of Contents, the division of this Agreement
into Articles, Sections, subsections, clauses, Schedules, Annexes and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reading only
and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this
Agreement.

(g) Any action required to be taken "within" a specified time period following
the occurrence of an event shall be required to be taken by no later than 5:00
p.m. Pacific time on the last day of such time period, which shall be

If any period referenced in this Agreement expires on a day that is not a
Business Day or any event or condition is required by the terms of this
Agreement to occur or be fulfilled on a day that is not a Business Day, such
period shall expire or such event or condition shall occur or be fulfilled, as

the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and upon delivery
by Buyer of the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price and the other amounts in
accordance with Section 2.04(a), Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller,
and Seller will sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, all of Seller's
rights, title and interest in all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens,

than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) or such other date or at such other
time or place as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing (the actual
date of the Closing, the "Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if

Section 2.03 Delivery of Estimated Closing Statement and Closing Payments

Closing Working Capital"); (iii) Closing Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"); (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Transaction Expenses");

together with such schedules and data with respect to the determination of the
foregoing to reasonably support the calculations set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement. In connection with the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Statement, Seller shall consult in good faith with Buyer regarding the amounts
and calculations therein and consider in good faith any comments or
modifications from Buyer. Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives
with reasonable access to all relevant information and personnel of the
Company and Seller in connection with the preparation of and Buyer's review of
the Estimated Closing Statement and all of the Company's and Seller's
documents and work papers (including those of the Company's accountants and
auditors) used in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement, in each
case, as Buyer or such Representative reasonably requests in connection with
their review of the Estimated Closing Statement, and subject to entry into
customary confidentiality and access letters if requested. If Seller and Buyer
are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Estimated Closing
Statement, such dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the Closing,
and the amounts set forth therein shall be as calculated by Seller for the
purposes of the Closing.

(b) The Estimated Closing Statement shall be accompanied by the
contemporaneous delivery by Seller of a written statement setting forth the
recipients, the respective amounts and the bank accounts to which each of the
amounts pursuant to Section 2.04(a) shall be paid (the "Closing Payments

behalf of the Company, all Transaction Expenses owed to such parties for which
final invoices have been provided prior to the Closing (to the extent such
Transaction Expenses have not been satisfied prior to the Closing).

(b) Buyer will deliver to the Company and Seller:

(i) a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, executed by a duly authorized

(iii) a counterpart to the Intellectual Property License Agreement, duly

executed stock power (provided that in lieu thereof, Seller may deliver a scan
of such certificate and arrange for delivery of the physical certificate
promptly following Closing);

(ii) a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, executed by a duly
authorized officer of the Company and officer of Seller, certifying to the

case effective as of the Closing;

(vi) a copy of the duly executed payoff letter in customary form (the "Debt
Payoff Letter") with respect to the Indebtedness of the Company under the
Credit Agreement that (A) specifies the aggregate amount required to be paid

"Debt Payoff Amount") and (B) provides for the release of all Liens and other
security over the properties and assets of the Company that secure all such
amounts upon payment of the Debt Payoff Amount;

(vii) documentary evidence reflecting the removal of the Persons authorized to
draw thereupon or have access to the Bank Accounts set forth in Section 6.18;

(viii) an executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 from each recipient of the

(ix) an executed IRS Form W-9 from Seller; and

(x) a certificate of non-foreign status from Seller meeting the requirements
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445 2(b), duly executed by an authorized
officer of Seller.

(d) Unless otherwise designated by the payee thereof, all payments to be made
pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be made (i) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and (ii) to the applicable bank account or
accounts designated in the Closing Payments Statement or, with respect to the
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the final invoices in accordance with
Section 2.04(a)(iii).

Section 2.05 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to Seller a written
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's and the Company's
good faith calculation of (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Working Capital,
(iii) Closing Indebtedness, (iv) Transaction Expenses and (v) Replacement LTI
Award Cost, in each case, determined in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and as of the Cut-Off Time on a reasonable basis, together with
such schedules and data with respect to the determination of the foregoing to
reasonably support the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement. The
Closing Statement shall entirely disregard (x) effects on the assets or
liabilities of the Company as a result of the Transactions or of any financing
or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or its
Affiliates or any other transaction entered into by Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, if any, (y) all plans,
transactions and changes that Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be
initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Company or its
business or assets and (z) all facts and circumstances that are unique or
particular to Buyer. Following delivery of the Closing Statement and until the
Closing Statement has become final and binding as set forth in this Section
2.05, Buyer shall provide to Seller and its Representatives reasonable access
to all relevant information and personnel of the Company in connection with
Seller's review of the Closing Statement. Buyer shall also provide all of the
Company's documents and work papers (including those of the Company's
accountants and auditors) used in the preparation of the Closing Statement, in
each case, as Seller or such Representatives reasonably requests in connection
with their review of the Closing Statement, and subject to entry into
customary confidentiality and access letters if requested. (b) If Seller disagrees with the Closing Statement or the calculations of the
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement, then within 45 days after receipt
of the Closing Statement, Seller may deliver written notice to Buyer (a
"Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
reason for such disagreement and Seller's proposed alternative calculations
with respect to the items or amounts with which it disagrees (each, a
"Disputed Item"). Any item or amount not specifically objected to in the
Dispute Notice (an "Undisputed Item") shall become final and binding on the
parties for purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent that an
adjustment to a Disputed Item made in accordance with this Section 2.05
requires an offsetting adjustment to be made to an Undisputed Item. If Seller
fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer within 45 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement to Seller, or if Seller notifies Buyer in writing that
it will not deliver a Dispute Notice, then the Closing Statement in its
entirety shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement.

(c) If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice within 45 days after delivery of the
Closing Statement to Seller, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve each Disputed Item. Any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and
Seller with respect to each Disputed Item shall be final and binding on the
parties for purposes of this Agreement. If Buyer and Seller are able to
resolve any of the Disputed Items, the Closing Statement shall be modified to
the extent necessary to reflect such resolution. If Buyer and Seller are able
to resolve all of the Disputed Items, then the Closing Statement, adjusted to
reflect such resolution of all Disputed Items, shall be final and binding on
the parties for purposes of this Agreement. If any Disputed Item remains
unresolved within 20 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then either
Buyer or Seller may refer only such unresolved Disputed Items to the
Accounting Arbitrator for final determination.

(d) Buyer and Seller shall each have the opportunity to provide written
submissions regarding their positions on the remaining unresolved Disputed
Items to the Accounting Arbitrator no later than 20 days after the date the
remaining unresolved Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Arbitrator.
There shall be no material ex parte communication with the Accounting
Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller shall: (i) to the extent practical, provide all
other items in their possession reasonably requested by the Accounting
Arbitrator; and (ii) provide copies of all of the foregoing to each other (in
each case in such a manner so as not to waive or eliminate any privilege
applicable to any such information, if possible).

(e) The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only (i) those Disputed Items
submitted to it for resolution and (ii) any Undisputed Items or Disputed Items
previously resolved between Buyer and Seller that require an offsetting
adjustment to be made in connection with the resolution of such Disputed
Items. In resolving each such Disputed Item, the Accounting Arbitrator (i)
shall resolve such Disputed Item in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, including the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses and Replacement LTI Award Cost (as applicable), (ii)
shall make its determination based solely on the written presentations and
supporting material provided by Buyer and Seller and not pursuant to any
independent review and (iii) may not assign a value to any item (A) greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller or (B)
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller, in
each case in such party's final submission to the Accounting Arbitrator. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator, and shall
not have the power to modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement.

(f) The parties shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to Buyer
and Seller, as promptly as practicable, but no later than 30 days after its
appointment, a written report setting forth (i) the resolution of each
Disputed Item submitted to it and (ii) all adjustments that are required to be
made to any Undisputed Items or Disputed Items previously resolved between
Buyer and Seller to reflect such resolution (the "Arbitrator's Report"). The
Arbitrator's Report and the revised Closing Statement reflecting the foregoing
shall be final and binding upon the parties for purposes of this Agreement and
shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable, absent manifest
error.

(g) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne
by (i) Buyer in the proportion that (A) the aggregate dollar amount of the
Disputed Items that are resolved in favor of Seller bears to (B) the aggregate
dollar amount of the Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator and
(ii) Seller in the proportion that (A) the aggregate dollar amount of the
Disputed Items that are resolved in favor of Buyer bears to (B) the aggregate
dollar amount of the Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator, in
each case, as finally determined by the Accounting Arbitrator. For example,
should the Disputed Items total $1,000 and the Accounting Arbitrator awards
$600 in favor of Seller, 60% of the aggregate amount of fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator's review and production of the

applicable Law.

Section 2.06 Withholding. Buyer and Seller and each of their respective
Affiliates and agents shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any payment

paid by Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.06 (other than in the case of a
compensatory payment or any deduction or withholding that results from the
failure to provide a form contemplated by Section 2.04(c)(viii) or (ix) or certificate
contemplated by Section 2.04(c)(x)), Buyer shall: (a) provide the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding is required reasonable prior
written notice of such anticipated deduction or withholding (together with any
legal basis therefor), (b) provide such Person with a reasonable opportunity
to deliver any forms or other documentation or take any other steps to avoid
such deduction or withholding in accordance with applicable Tax Law, and (c)
reasonably consult and cooperate with such Person to attempt to reduce or
eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that any such amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Authority, such
withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

contributes to (or has an obligation to contribute to), or has any liability
(contingent or otherwise) in respect of, (i) any "pension plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) covered by Title IV of ERISA or subject to Section 412
or 4971 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or (ii) a "multiple employer plan"
(as defined in Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA) or "multiemployer plan" (as

knowledge, threatened, in each case, with respect to any Plan and (iii) the
Company has not engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction," within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to
any Plan. Each Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of

determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge
of Seller, no event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably
be expected to result in the revocation of any such determination. (d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
Liability of the Company, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or
payable, or required to be provided, to any MyCase Service Provider under any
Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any MyCase
Service Provider, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,

any Company Plan; or (v) limit or restrict the right to terminate or amend any
Company Plan on or following the Closing. Neither the execution and delivery

reasonably be expected to, result in a change (a) in the ownership of a
corporation, (b) in the effective control of a corporation or (c) in the
ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation, within the
meaning of section 280G of the Code.

(e) No Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of Section

indemnify any MyCase Service Provider for the imposition of an excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code or under Section 409A of the Code.

(g) No Plan, other than Company Plans, will automatically transfer to Buyer or
a Subsidiary of Buyer by operation of applicable Law in connection with the
Transactions. Except as expressly provided in Section 6.07 or the Transition
Services Agreement, upon and following the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have no Liability under or with respect to any Plan other than the
Company Plans.

Section 4.13 Labor Matters.

(a) Neither Seller (with respect to the Business) nor the Company is a party
to any collective bargaining agreement or other contract or agreement with a
labor union respecting MyCase Service Providers, nor is any such agreement

or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened strikes, work stoppages, walkouts,
lockouts, picketing, slowdowns or other material labor disputes against Seller

service provider providing services to the Business. To the knowledge of
Seller, since January 1, 2016, no labor organization or group of employees of

employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of
work, "mass layoffs" and "plant closings," the provision of meal and rest
breaks, classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt from overtime pay
requirements, classification of individuals as non-employee contractors,
immigration, equal employment opportunities (including the prevention of
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation), background checks, and occupational safety and
health, except, in each case, for instances of non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business. Since January 1, 2016,
there have been no charges, complaints, lawsuits, arbitrations, audits,
investigations, grievances, representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
Seller, threatened, against Seller or the Company before or with the National
Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any
other applicable Governmental Authority, in each case, that would reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company. Since January 1, 2016, neither
Seller (with respect to the Business) nor the Company has closed any plant or
facility, effectuated any material layoffs of employees or implemented any
material early retirement or exit incentive program, nor is any such action or
program planned or announced any such action or program for the future.
Without limiting the generality of any other representation set forth in this
Section 4.13(a), to the knowledge of Seller, (i) since January 1, 2016, no
allegations or reports of sexual harassment, hostile work environment or
similar misconduct have been made against or by any current or former employee
of the Business with an annual base salary of $150,000 or more and (ii) none
of the Seller or its Subsidiaries is currently seeking, nor has any of Seller
or its Subsidiaries entered into, any settlement agreement that relates
primarily to an allegation of harassment (including sexual harassment) against
or by any current or former employee of the Business.

(b) Seller has provided to Buyer a list of all MyCase Service Providers as of

information; and (v) job location. As of the Signing Date, each MyCase Service
Provider who is an employee dedicates at least 75% of his or her average
weekly working hours to the Business (the "Service Condition"). Since January
1, 2016, the Company has not employed any individual other than any MyCase
Service Provider whose employment will transfer to the Company pursuant to
Section 6.07(d). There are no employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries who
satisfy the Service Condition but are not included on the Service Provider
List. Each independent contractor on the Service Provider List provides
services to the Company pursuant to a written agreement that has been provided
to Buyer.

set forth in any Transaction Agreement, (i) none of Buyer or any of its
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
Closing and (ii) prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations and businesses.

Section 6.03 Consents. Without limiting the generality of Section 10.10, each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents from
third parties other than any Governmental Authority that Buyer requests in
writing be obtained ("Third Party Consents") in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no party shall have any
obligation with respect to any Third Party Consents, to agree to (i) commence
any Litigation or (ii) offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party and (b) the consent of Buyer shall be required
with respect to (i) any non de minimis amendment or modification to any
Contract for the purposes of obtaining any such Third Party Consent and (ii)
any material obligations or accommodations (financial or otherwise) that would
be binding on Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company following
the Closing). Buyer acknowledges that certain Third Party Consents and waivers
with respect to the Transactions may be required from the parties to Contracts
to which the Company is a party and that obtaining such Third Party Consents
is not a condition to the consummation of the Transactions. Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket amounts
paid in cash to third parties in order to obtain Third Party Consents, in each
case with the prior written consent of Buyer. To the extent Buyer does not
reimburse Seller or its Subsidiaries for any such amounts paid on or prior to
the Cut-Off Time, the Company shall be deemed to have a current asset in the
amount of such unreimbursed costs and expenses included in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital. This Section 6.03 shall not relate or apply to any
Consents sought pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

Section 6.04 Antitrust Notifications and Other Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Each party shall promptly provide all supplemental information and
documentation requested by any Governmental Authority relating to any required
regulatory approvals and respond as promptly as practicable to any inquires or requests
received from any Governmental Authority for additional information or
documentation. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws,
the parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall (A)
promptly notify and furnish the other parties copies of each (i) filing such
party submits to any Governmental Authority and (ii) correspondence or
communication between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case relating to the
subject matter of this Section 6.04 or the Transactions (and, in the case of
any oral communication, a summary of such communication), (B) consult with and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed filing and any
written or oral communication or correspondence by such party to any
Governmental Authority relating to the subject matter of this Section 6.04 or
the Transactions (provided that copies of filings under the HSR Act need not
be shared), (C) consider in good faith the views of such party in connection
with any such proposed filing and any such written or oral communication or
correspondence to any Governmental Authority relating to the subject matter of
this Section 6.04 or the Transactions and (D) promptly inform the other party
of any material developments and keep the other party reasonably informed of
the progress. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each party shall be permitted
to remove any commercially sensitive information before sharing with the other
party, or such party's legal counsel may share complete versions on a counsel-
to-counsel basis with the other party's legal counsel and (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall require the parties to share valuation materials or materials
qualifying as Items 4(c) and 4(d) under the HSR Act or written communication
regarding the same. No party shall agree to, or permit any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their respective Representatives to, participate in any
meeting or substantive discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation, inquiry or any other matter contemplated by
this Section 6.04 or the Transactions unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent appropriate or permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or discussion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and the
Company shall take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to (i) obtain
all Consents required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law, (ii)
enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire and (iii) avoid
or eliminate all impediments under all Antitrust Laws to cause the
Transactions to occur as soon as practicable following the Signing Date and,
in any event, prior to the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article IX. Such actions shall include (A) as promptly as
practicable complying with or modifying all requests and inquiries for
additional information or documentation (including any second request) by any
Governmental Authority, (B) offering, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of the Equity Securities, assets,
rights, products or businesses of the Company and any other prohibitions
against or limitations, conditions or restrictions on, the Company and (C)
initiating, opposing, contesting, defending, vacating, terminating,
overturning and appealing any threatened or pending Litigation or preliminary
or permanent injunction or other Order that would adversely affect the ability of any party to consummate, or otherwise
delay the consummation of, the Transactions, and taking other actions to
prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Buyer or its Subsidiaries to offer, take, agree to offer, or agree to take,
any of the foregoing actions with respect to any Person other than Buyer, its
Subsidiaries or the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be obligated
to commit to take any action pursuant to Section 6.03, this Section 6.04 or
Section 10.10, the consummation of which or effectiveness thereof is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Closing, or pay any fee or grant any
concession in connection with obtaining any Consents, authorizations or
approvals required to consummate the Transactions.

(d) From the Signing Date through the date (i) of termination of the required
waiting periods under the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws and
(ii) any Consents of any other applicable Governmental Authority are obtained,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any
action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of
clearance or the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act
and such other applicable Antitrust Laws, or the obtaining of such Consents
from any applicable Governmental Authorities.

The obligations set forth in this Section 6.04 shall be in addition to, and
not in limitation of the generality of, the matters set forth in Section 6.03
and Section 10.10.

Section 6.05 Access to Information.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws
(including COVID-19 Measures), during the Interim Period, Seller shall permit
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to permit Buyer and its authorized
Representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the management-level employees and books
and records of the Company and the Business. Seller and the Company shall also
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Buyer such financial, Tax and operating
data (other than in respect of any Seller Consolidated Returns) and other
information with respect to the Company and the Business and its offices,
employees, businesses and operations as Buyer shall from time to time
reasonably request to the extent reasonably necessary to enable Buyer to
complete the Transactions. All access and investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.05 shall be coordinated through the Company's General Counsel (or
such Person's designee) and shall be conducted at Buyer's expense and in such
a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
businesses of the Company. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the Company are
currently operating (and intend during the Interim Period to operate) their
respective businesses remotely and access to the employees and books and
records of the Company and the Business may be provided on an electronic or
other remote access basis, as reasonably determined by Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the
Interim Period, neither Seller nor the Company shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose data or information where such access or disclosure
would reasonably be expected to (i) jeopardize any attorney-client, accountant-client or other privilege of the
Company or Seller, (ii) contravene any Law, Contract or any other obligation
of confidentiality, or (iii) relate to the Company's sale process, including
any information related to proposals from other Persons relating to any other
potential transaction with the Company. Seller shall (A) promptly notify Buyer
if any information is withheld by reason of the exceptions in clauses (i) and
(ii) of the foregoing sentence and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to
permit the sharing of any information so withheld in a manner consistent with
any applicable obligation, Law, or the preservation of any such privilege.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its Representatives not to, contact any
supplier, vendor, customer, partner or other business relations of the Company
regarding the business, operations, assets, financial condition or prospects
of the Company (other than in connection with general industry research
without reference to the Transactions) or the Transactions. In addition, prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall have no right to perform any sampling, monitoring
or other surface or subsurface invasive or intrusive investigation,
assessment, testing or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials, air,
or other environmental media of the sort generally referred to as a Phase II
environmental investigation at any of the properties or facilities of the
Company without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company shall
have the right to have one or more of its Representatives present at all times
during any visits, examinations, discussions or contacts contemplated by this
Section 6.05.

(c) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect. Buyer shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) to hold, any Evaluation Material (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) and other information provided to any of
them in connection with the Transactions in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which terms shall apply to Buyer as if
it was a party thereto and a "Recipient" thereunder.

(d) During the Interim Period, each party shall give written notice to the
other party promptly (and in any event, within two Business Days), upon
becoming aware of any Effect, that, if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date, would reasonably be expected to (individually or in the
aggregate) result in a failure of a condition set forth in Article VII.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice, nor the obligation to make (or
failure to make) such notice, shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants of, or the conditions to the obligations of, any party.

Section 6.06 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) All rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether or not
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after Closing (including in respect of any
matters arising in connection with the Transaction Agreements or the
Transactions), existing as of the Signing Date in favor of any DandO Indemnified
Person as contained in (i) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Company or (ii) any Contract to which the Company is a party that is set forth
in Schedule 6.06(a), in each case in effect as of the Signing Date, shall continue in full
force and shall survive the Transactions until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date. For a period of six years after the Closing Date, (i) the
Company shall not amend, repeal or modify any provision in the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company, in each case in effect as of the
Signing Date, relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses of any DandO Indemnified Person with respect to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether or not asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Closing and (ii) all DandO Indemnified Persons shall
continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as in effect as
of the Signing Date. No change, modification or amendment of such documents or
arrangements shall be made that could adversely affect any DandO Indemnified
Person's right thereto without the prior written consent of such DandO
Indemnified Person.

(b) For six years after the Closing, to the extent provided in the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, in each case in effect as of the
Signing Date, the Company shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and
exculpate and release from any liability to Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) the DandO Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses
and DandO Losses and (ii) advance, unconditionally and interest-free, to such
DandO Indemnified Persons, all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim promptly after receipt of statements for any such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim. For six years after the Closing, to the extent provided
in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, in each case in
effect as of the Signing Date, none of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
judgment in any action or investigation or threatened action or investigation,
in each case, against a DandO Indemnified Person without the prior written
consent of such DandO Indemnified Person.

(c) At its sole expense, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company as of the
Closing, to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (collectively,
"DandO Insurance") naming all DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries.
The DandO Insurance shall have a claims period of at least six years from and
after the Closing Date and be issued by an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit ratings as Seller's current insurance carrier with respect to
officers' and directors' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance. The terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage (including
as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) of the DandO Insurance shall
be at least as favorable as the existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
arising out of or relating to acts or omissions occurring or existing (or
alleged to have occurred or existed) at or prior to the Closing (including in
connection with the Transaction Agreements and the Transactions).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the cost of such insurance would exceed a
one-time premium payment equal to 250% of the annual premium most recently
paid by, or allocated with respect to, the Company prior to the Signing Date
with respect to officers' and directors' liability insurance, then Buyer will,
or will cause the Company to, obtain as much coverage as is reasonably
available under substantially similar policies for such amount. Buyer shall
cause the Company to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and effect for
its full term and will honor all obligations under such DandO Insurance. (d) If the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
50% or more of its properties and other Assets to any Person (including by
liquidation, dissolution or assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar
action), then in each such case the Company shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

(e) The Company shall be a full indemnitor of first resort, shall be required
to advance the full amount of all DandO Expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified
Person and shall be liable for the full amount of all DandO Losses to the extent
legally permitted and as required pursuant to this Agreement or the
Organizational Documents of the Company as of the Signing Date. The
immediately preceding sentence shall apply without regard to any rights a DandO
Indemnified Person may have against (i) any insurer providing insurance
coverage under an insurance policy issued to, or covering, such Person or (ii)
any other Persons. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer and the Company
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases Seller and each direct and
indirect equityholder of Seller from any and all claims for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights and
benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.06 shall not be
terminated or modified in any manner adversely affecting such rights or
benefits without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Person. The
provisions of this Section 6.06 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his
or her executors, administrators and personal representatives, each of whom is
an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.06, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights, including rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive the consummation
of the Transactions.

Section 6.07 Employee Matters.

(a) Within ten days of the Signing Date, and again five days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall revise the Service Provider List to
reflect new hires, employment terminations, changes to employment status and
any other changes thereto which are not prohibited by this Agreement, and
promptly deliver such updated Service Provider List to Buyer.

(b) As of the Closing, the Company shall assume (and shall honor, pay, perform
and satisfy) any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or
in respect of, each (x) MyCase Service Provider (other than any Inactive
Employee or Visa Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee in
accordance with Section 6.07(b) or Section 6.07(i), as applicable despite
Buyer's satisfaction of its obligations under such Sections) and (y) Inactive
Employee or Visa Employee who becomes a Continuing Employee in accordance with
Section 6.07(b) or Section 6.07(i) (or who does not become a Continuing
Employee due to Buyer's failure to satisfy its obligations under such
Sections), irrespective of whether such liabilities, obligations and responsibilities arise prior to, on or after the Closing (such
liabilities, obligations and responsibilities, the "Assumed Employee
Liabilities"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Assumed Employee Liabilities
shall not include, and Seller or its applicable Plan (other than a Company
Plan) shall retain the following liabilities (the "Retained Employee
Liabilities"): (i) health and welfare Plan claims incurred prior to the end of
the applicable "Service Term" under, and subject to the terms of, the
Transition Services Agreement (including providing any applicable long-term
disability benefits under a Plan with respect to a qualifying disability that
occurred prior to the Closing and providing continuation coverage pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") with respect to MyCase Service Providers
and their qualified beneficiaries who have elected COBRA continuation coverage
or experienced a COBRA qualifying event under Seller's group health plan prior
to the Closing); (ii) Liabilities for claims for workers compensation benefits
and occupational health claims that are incurred prior to the Closing; (iii)
Liabilities under the Seller's 401(k) plan (other than with respect to any
account balances and loans which may be rolled over to a 401(k) plan
established by Buyer in connection with Section 6.07(e); (iv) except as
provided in Section 6.07(h), Liabilities relating to Seller Equity Awards
(including any obligations to issue any Seller Equity Awards pursuant to any
offer letters or otherwise); (v) Liabilities of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing to pay transaction-related
bonuses or change in control payments (including the employer portion of any
employment, payroll, social security, Medicare, national insurance
contributions, unemployment or other Taxes or similar obligations associated
with such amounts) to MyCase Service Providers in connection with or resulting
from the Closing (unless such liabilities are Transaction Expenses); (vi)
Liabilities in respect of Inactive Employees and Visa Employees to the extent
described in the first sentence of this Section 6.07(b) and Sections 6.07(d)
and 6.07(i), respectively, as not being assumed by Buyer or the Company or as
being at Seller's cost; and (vii) Liabilities under the Cash Incentive Plans
and Liabilities in respect of PTO, in each case relating to the period prior
to the Closing, that are not included as current liabilities in Closing
Working Capital.

(c) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2020,
the Company shall continue to offer Continuing Employees the benefits set
forth on Schedule 6.07(c)(i). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall take such necessary actions to transfer each Company Plan
set forth on Schedule 6.07(c)(ii) from Seller or any applicable Subsidiary to
the Company; provided, that with respect to each such Company Plan that is not
an offer letter, the Liabilities with respect to such Company Plans shall be
included as current liabilities in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.
With respect to each Company Plan set forth on Schedule 6.07(c)(ii) that is
not an offer letter (such Company Plans, "Cash Incentive Plans"), the Company
shall continue to maintain such Company Plan during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2020, and shall pay out amounts under
each such Company Plan for each applicable performance period ending on or
prior to December 31, 2020 pursuant to the terms of such Company Plan in a
manner consistent with past practices of Seller and the Company; provided that
the Liabilities under the Cash Incentive Plans relating to the period prior to
the Closing are included as current liabilities in Closing Working Capital.
With respect to any performance metrics included in any such Company Plan, the
Company shall calculate actual performance at the conclusion of the applicable
performance period in a manner consistent with past practices of Seller and
shall utilize such calculations to determine the applicable payments under the
Company Plan. Seller shall provide the Company with any information reasonably
requested by the Company to perform such calculations, and shall have the
opportunity to review the results of such calculations (and the Company shall
consider in good faith Seller's reasonable comments with respect thereto)
prior to the making of any such payments.

(d) Effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date (or such
other date on or prior to the Closing Date as mutually agreed by Buyer and
Seller (the "Transfer Date")), Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take such
action as necessary to the transfer the employment of each MyCase Service
Provider who is an employee (other than any Inactive Employee or any Visa
Employee for whom Buyer elects for Seller to continue employment in accordance
with Section 6.07(i)) from Seller or any applicable Subsidiary to the Company;
provided, however, that any MyCase Service Provider who is an Inactive
Employee as of the Transfer Date, but who returns to active employment prior
to the Closing, may be transferred to the Company at any time prior to the
Closing. Each Inactive Employee as of the Closing Date who is not able to
return to active employment on or prior to the Closing Date shall continue to
be employed by Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) at Seller's
cost. With respect to any such Inactive Employee who is able to return to
active employment within six months of the Closing Date (or such later date as
required by Law), Buyer shall cause the Company to offer employment to such
Inactive Employee upon terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms
and conditions of employment for similarly-situated employees of the Company
(but for the same job title and base compensation as such Inactive Employee's
employment with Seller) and effective upon the date such Inactive Employee is
able to return to active employment ("Delayed Hire Date"). If an Inactive
Employee is unable to return to active employment within six months of the
Closing Date (or such later date as required by Law), Buyer and any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall have no obligation to offer
employment to such Inactive Employee and shall have no further Liabilities in
respect of such Inactive Employee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any severance or termination pay) unless and until Buyer (or one of
its Subsidiaries including the Company) otherwise offers, and such Inactive
Employee accepts and commences, employment with Buyer (or one of its
Subsidiaries including the Company). Each MyCase Service Provider (including
Inactive Employees) whose employment is transferred to the Company (or who
accepts an offer and commences employment with the Company within six months
of the Closing Date (or such later as required by Law), as applicable) in
accordance with the terms of this Section 6.07(d) or Section 6.07(i) shall be
considered a "Continuing Employee". Effective as of the Transfer Date or
Delayed Hire Date, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall take all such
actions necessary to, and shall, assign and the Company shall assume all
rights and obligations pursuant to each Restrictive Covenant Agreement.

(e) As of the Closing Date or Delayed Hire Date, if applicable (or such later
date specified in the Transition Services Agreement), the active participation
of Continuing Employees in Plans (other than Company Plans) shall cease, and
Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates shall have in effect
employee benefit plans (including a group health plan) in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, Buyer (or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Company) shall establish a 401(k) plan for the benefit of Continuing Employees following the
Closing, and the Seller, the Company and Buyer shall work cooperatively to
facilitate the transfer of 401(k) account balances from any Plan, including
any outstanding plan loans, to a similar plan established or maintained by
Buyer or the Company for the benefit of Continuing Employees.

(f) Effective as of the Closing, the Company shall assume all obligations of
Seller or any of their Subsidiaries for the accrued, unused vacation, personal
holiday or other paid time off (collectively, "PTO") that each Continuing
Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing Date (including
any earned PTO to be used in future years) to the extent (i) such PTO is not
required by Law to be paid out by Seller or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) the Liabilities in respect of thereof are included in
Closing Working Capital. The Company shall credit and honor, in accordance
with the terms of the applicable policy of Seller, all PTO accrued but not yet
taken by the Continuing Employees.

(g) For purposes of a Continuing Employee's eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or
retiree medical plan) and entitlement to benefits, including the determination
of the level of vacation and severance pay benefits under the benefit and
compensation plans, programs, Contracts and arrangements of Buyer, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the "Buyer
Plans"), Buyer and the Company shall credit each Continuing Employee with his
or her years of service with the Company and any predecessor Persons
(including Seller), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date to credit for such service
under any similar Buyer Plan, except where such crediting would result in
duplication of benefits. Buyer shall use commercially reasonably efforts to
provide that the Buyer Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on
the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions were waived
or satisfied under similar Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit such Continuing Employees
for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date
in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses in the applicable
plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses relate.

(h) Equity Awards.

(i) To the extent there are any unvested Seller Equity Awards held by MyCase
Service Providers that (x) are scheduled to vest following the Closing and on
or prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) will be
forfeited in accordance with their terms as a result of the Closing (or any
transfer of employment to Buyer or the Company) (such Seller Equity Awards,
other than the Seller Equity Awards set forth on Schedule 6.07(h)(i), the
"Forfeited Seller Equity Awards"), promptly (and, in any event, within fifteen
Business Days) following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause one
of its Affiliates (including the Company) to, (A) grant to each Continuing
Employee who held a Forfeited Seller Equity Award (each such Continuing
Employee, an "Eligible Employee," and collectively, the "Eligible Employees")
a long-term cash incentive award in an amount equal to the value of such
Eligible Employee's Forfeited Seller Equity Award, and (B) grant one or more
additional long-term cash incentive awards in an aggregate amount equal to $150,000 to one or more of
the Eligible Employees, with the amount of each individual award and the
selection of the applicable Eligible Employee(s) to receive such award(s) to
be determined by the Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) in its sole discretion
(each long-term cash incentive award granted pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B), a "Replacement LTI Award"). The value of each Forfeited Seller
Equity Award shall be calculated by multiplying the number of shares of Seller
common stock ("Seller Shares") subject to such Forfeited Seller Equity Award
that would have otherwise vested (subject to the applicable holders' continued
employment with Seller or its Subsidiaries and achievement of any performance-
vesting conditions at the target level of performance) multiplied by $151.70
(the "Seller Share Price"). For purposes of any Forfeited Seller Equity Award
that is a stock option to acquire Seller Shares, the value of such Forfeited
Seller Equity Award will be calculated based on the Seller Share Price, less
the applicable exercise price. Each Replacement LTI Award will (i) vest based
on the applicable Eligible Employee's continued employment with Buyer or one
of its Affiliates (including the Company) through the one-year anniversary of
the Closing Date or, if earlier, will vest upon a termination of employment by
Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the Company) without cause on or
after the Closing Date and (ii) be paid to the applicable Continuing Employee
promptly following the applicable vesting date.

(ii) Promptly following the Signing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with all
information necessary to implement the commitments to grant Replacement LTI
Awards as set forth in Section 6.07(h)(i) above and shall provide any updates
to such information three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

(iii) Promptly (and, in any event, within ten Business Days) following the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause one of
its Affiliates (including the Company) to) pay to Seller an amount equal to
the value of all Replacement LTI Awards that were forfeited or otherwise not
paid to the Eligible Employees.

(i) Other than as set forth on Schedule 6.07(i), if any MyCase Service
Provider requires a work permit, employment pass, visa or other legal or
regulatory approval for his or her employment with the Company (a "Visa
Employee"), Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries
(including the Company) to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any such permit, pass or visa to be transferred to the Company prior to the
Closing Date or otherwise obtain any required approvals for employment with
the Company following the Closing (including by utilizing, to the extent
available, any premium processing options with respect to requests for
approvals and instructing any such Visa Employee to provide any required
notice, or make any required filings, in order to obtain such permit, pass,
visa or other approval). If approval of such transfer, or any other required
approval, is not obtained and in effect prior to the Closing Date, at the
election of Buyer, (i) to the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall transfer
the employment of such Visa Employee to the Company in accordance with Section
6.07(d) or (ii) Seller or its Subsidiaries shall continue to employ such Visa
Employee for at least six months following the Closing at the Company's cost
(calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement, as applicable) and shall (to the extent permitted by Law) make such
Visa Employee available to provide services to the Company. With respect to
any Visa Employee who remains employed by Seller or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, once such permit, pass or visa is transferred or
other approval is obtained and in effect with respect to such Visa Employee,
or the parties mutually agree that an employment transfer may occur, Buyer
shall cause the Company to offer employment to such Visa Employee upon terms
and conditions substantially similar to the terms and conditions of employment
for similarly-situated employees of Buyer (but for the same job title and base
compensation as such Visa Employee's employment with Seller) and effective
upon the date such permit, pass, visa or other approval is obtained and in
effect (such date to be considered such individual's "Delayed Hire Date");
provided, however, that if such permit, pass or visa is not transferred or
other approval is not obtained and in effect within six months of the Closing
Date (or such later date as required by Law), Buyer and any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall have no obligation to offer
employment to such Visa Employee and shall have no further Liabilities in
respect of such Visa Employee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any severance or termination pay) unless and until Buyer (or one of
its Subsidiaries including the Company) otherwise offers, and such Visa
Employee accepts and commences, employment with Buyer (or one of its
Subsidiaries including the Company).

(j) Seller shall not (i) take any action that would impede, hinder, interfere
or otherwise compete (directly or indirectly) with Buyer's effort to hire or
employ any MyCase Service Provider in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) enforce against any Continuing Employee any non-compete or
other restrictive covenant that would restrict or prohibit in any manner such
employee's ability to become employed by Buyer, the Company, or any of its
Affiliates, or such employee's employment or ability to provide services to
Buyer, the Company, or any of its Affiliates in any capacity from and after
the Closing.

Without limiting the generality of Section 10.06, all provisions contained in
this Section 6.07 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties,
and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person (including any current
or former MyCase Service Providers and any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
or (ii) to continued employment or service with the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Section 6.07 is
intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any
plan, program, Contract, arrangement or policy of the Company, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates nor shall it interfere with Buyer's, the Company's or
any of their respective Affiliates' right to amend, modify or terminate any
Plan or Buyer Plan in accordance with its provisions (subject to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.07) or to terminate the employment or service of
any MyCase Service Provider for any reason, provided that the Company shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 6.07(a).

Section 6.08 Tax Matters.

(a) Any Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Buyer when due, whether levied on
Buyer, the Company or the Seller, and Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
required to be prepared and filed by Buyer or the Company with respect to any
such Transfer Taxes; provided that Seller shall pay any Transfer Taxes imposed
with respect to any transfer pursuant to Section 6.12 or as a result of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(b) Section 338(h)(10) Election. (i) Buyer and Seller shall join in making a timely and irrevocable election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and the Treasury Regulations and
administrative pronouncements thereunder) and any comparable provision of
state or local Tax Law with respect to the acquisition of the Company (the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall not take
any position contrary thereto except pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. Within 30 days following the final
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.05
(but no later than 90 days prior to the due date for the Section 338 Election
Forms), Buyer shall prepare IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms required by
applicable state and local Tax Law (collectively, the "Section 338 Election
Forms") and shall deliver the Section 338 Election Forms to Seller for review
and approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(ii) Within 30 days following the final determination of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.05 (but no later than 90 days prior to
the due date for the Section 338 Election Forms), Buyer shall prepare a
determination of the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price ("ADSP") (as defined in the
applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) and a proposed
allocation of the ADSP among the assets of the Company in a manner consistent
with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code (the "Proposed Allocation") and shall
deliver the Proposed Allocation to Seller. Within 30 days of receipt of the
Proposed Allocation, Seller shall notify Buyer that Seller agrees with the
Proposed Allocation or shall identify any objections to the Proposed
Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any disagreement over the Proposed Allocation. If Buyer and Seller
cannot agree on a mutually satisfactory allocation within 30 days after
delivery of the Proposed Allocation, a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm, the costs and expenses of which shall be borne entirely by
the Company, shall determine the appropriate allocation, which determination
shall be binding on the parties. As soon as practicable after Buyer and Seller
are in agreement on the allocation or the allocation has otherwise been
finally determined in accordance with this Section 6.08(b) (the "Final
Allocation"), Buyer shall prepare consistently therewith IRS Form 8883 and any
similar forms required by applicable state and local Tax Law (collectively,
the "Section 338 Allocation Forms"), and promptly deliver copies of the
Section 338 Allocation Forms to Seller for review and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the purchase price is
increased as a result of an adjustment pursuant to this Agreement, then the
Final Allocation shall be adjusted to increase amounts allocable to goodwill.
If the purchase price is decreased as a result of an adjustment pursuant to
his Agreement, then the Final Allocation shall be adjusted to decrease amounts
allocable to goodwill and, with respect to any excess, the Final Allocation
shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Buyer, the Company
and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including but not limited to the
Section 338 Election Forms and the Section 338 Allocation Forms) consistent
with the Final Allocation and will not take any position contrary thereto
except pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code.

(iii) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent Buyer or Seller from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
based upon or arising out of the Final Allocation or any other matter set
forth in this Section 6.08(b), and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority challenging
the Final Allocation or any other matter set forth in this Section 6.08(b).

(iv) Buyer shall not make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or
any similar provision under state, local, or non-U.S. Tax Law) with respect to
the acquisition of the Company.

(c) Without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required by
applicable Law, Buyer shall not file or amend or permit the Company to file or
amend any Tax Return relating to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date, or make or change any election that is
retroactive to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date, if such amendment or election would result in an increase in any
Tax liability included in Closing Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness or
reasonably be expected to result in Seller or its Affiliates being liable for
any amounts with respect to Taxes under this Agreement or pursuant to
applicable Law or required to file any amended Seller Consolidated Return.

(d) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, (i) any Tax Returns of any combined, consolidated or unitary group that
includes the Company and for which Seller is the common parent ("Seller
Consolidated Returns") and (ii) any income Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods ("Seller Separate Returns," and together with the Seller
Consolidated Returns, the "Seller Prepared Returns"), and shall pay all Taxes
due with such Tax Returns. Except to the extent inconsistent with applicable
Law, any such Seller Separate Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
past practice. For the avoidance of doubt, any items of income or gain
attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election shall be included on the
Seller Consolidated Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any Seller Separate
Returns that are filed following the Closing Date shall be provided to Buyer
for its review and comment at least 30 days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return, and will incorporate any reasonable comments received from Buyer at
least 10 days prior to filing. Following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, any Tax Returns of the
Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods other than Seller Prepared Returns and any
Tax Returns for Straddle Periods (the "Buyer Prepared Returns"). Except to the
extent inconsistent with applicable Law, any such Buyer Prepared Returns shall
be prepared in accordance with past practice. Buyer shall provide drafts of
the Buyer Prepared Returns to Seller for its review and comment at least 30
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return (or as soon as reasonably
practicable in the case of any Tax Return that is due within 30 days of
Closing or which is a non-income Tax Return), and will incorporate any
reasonable comments received from Seller related to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
or pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period at least 10 days prior to filing.
Seller shall pay to Buyer the portion of any Taxes due with a Buyer Prepared
Return for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 8.02 as soon as
reasonably practicable following the filing of such Tax Return and delivery of
such filed Tax Return to Seller. Following the Closing, the Company and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably cooperate,
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns by any other
party.

(e) The parties agree to utilize the following conventions for determining the
amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period; provided, however, if as a result of the Transactions, the
value of any asset is reassessed for purposes of determining the amount of any
property or other Tax, any resulting increase in Tax for such Straddle Period
shall be treated as being solely with respect to the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning on the date after the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of
all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes,
withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the Company filed
a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a
"closing of the books methodology." For purposes of this Section 6.08(e), any
item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions) for income Tax purposes shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(f) If Buyer receives written notice from a Governmental Authority of an audit
or other legal proceeding or a written notice of deficiency for Taxes of
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period for which Seller is
responsible pursuant to this Agreement (a "Tax Proceeding"), Buyer shall
notify Seller of its receipt of such communication as soon as reasonably
practicable but in any case within ten Business Days of receipt; provided,
that the failure of Buyer to timely give such notice shall not relieve Seller
of any of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that
Seller is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. Seller shall
have the right to control any Tax Proceeding relating solely to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period; provided, that (A) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
regarding any material development of such Tax Proceeding and shall permit
Buyer to participate in such Tax Proceeding (to the extent such participation
is permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority), and (B) Seller shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining
the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the case of (i) any Tax Proceeding
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that Seller does not timely elect to
assume the control of or (ii) any Tax Proceeding relating to any Straddle
Period, Buyer shall have the right to control such Tax Proceeding; provided,
that (A) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding any material
development of such Tax Proceeding and shall permit Seller to participate in
such Tax Proceeding (to the extent such participation is permitted by the
applicable Governmental Authority), and (B) Buyer shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent
of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will
have the exclusive right to control, at its own expense, the audit of any Tax
Return of the consolidated group the parent of which is Seller, including,
without limitation, any disposition or settlement of such audit.

(g) All refunds of Taxes (or credits in lieu thereof) of the Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date as determined in accordance with the same principles provided for in
Section 6.08(e)) for which Seller is responsible for pursuant to Section 8.02
shall be for the account of Seller (other than any refund (i) that was
included as an asset in Final Closing Working Capital or Final Closing
Indebtedness, (ii) that results from the carry back required by applicable Law
of any Tax assets attributable to a Tax period or portion of a Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date, and (iii) of Transfer Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 6.08(a)),
which shall be for the account of Buyer). To the extent that Buyer or the
Company receives a refund or credit that is for the account of Seller, Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount of such refund or credit (and interest received
from the taxing authority with respect to such refund), net of any Taxes and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such
Tax refund or credit. The amount due to Seller or Buyer as applicable shall be
payable ten days after receipt of the refund from the applicable taxing
authority or actual utilization of such credit to reduce Taxes for which Buyer
or the Company is responsible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to pay over to Seller the amount of any credit to the
extent that such amount is applied as a reduction of any Taxes due and payable
by the Company for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 8.02(c) of this
Agreement. Each of Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, cooperate with Seller to take, or cause the Company to take, any
commercially reasonable actions requested by Seller to obtain any such Tax
refund.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall Seller or its Affiliates or agents be obligated
to furnish or provide to Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives any Seller Consolidated Returns.

(i) The provisions of this Section 6.08 shall survive the Closing until 60
days following the expiration of the statute of limitations under applicable
Tax Law.

Section 6.09 Preservation of Records. Unless otherwise consented to in writing
by the parties, for a period of six years after the Closing, Seller and the
Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to,
destroy or otherwise dispose of material corporate, accounting, legal,
auditing, human resources and other books and records to the extent related to
the Business for the period prior to the Closing Date. The foregoing
prohibition shall apply without limitation to: (i) any documents (other than
any non-substantive documents) relating to any Litigation or investigations;
and (ii) all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and other material Tax
records or documents including claims for refunds, relating to the conduct and
operations of the Business or compliance with the rules and regulations of the
Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority prior to the
Closing Date, in each case, except in respect of any Seller Consolidated
Returns. For a period of six years after the Closing, under no circumstance shall any such destruction or disposition occur without first
offering to surrender such books and records and materials or such portions
thereof to the other party (at such other party's cost and expense) at least
30 days prior to the date of such proposed destruction or disposition. From
and after the Closing, each of Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, allow the other party and its Affiliates and
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, to inspect, review and make copies of such books
and records to the extent related to the Business for the period prior to the
Closing Date as such requesting party may deem necessary or appropriate from
time to time in connection with any bona fide business purpose relating to the
pre-Closing period, in each case at the requesting party's expense and in such
a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Person
providing such access.

Section 6.10 Exclusive Dealing. During the Interim Period, Seller shall not,
and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective directors, officers, employees, or Representatives to,
directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, encourage, seek, initiate, facilitate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to,
or otherwise cooperate in any way; or (b) enter into any agreement, in each
case of (a) and (b), with any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates)
concerning: (i) the purchase, sale or transfer of any Equity Securities of the
Company, including the Shares; (ii) any merger, recapitalization or business
combination involving the Company; (iii) any sale of a material portion of the
Assets of the Company or the Transferred Assets (other than such sale of
Assets which would not require the consent of Buyer pursuant to Section 6.01),
or (iv) any similar transaction involving the Company or the Business (each,
an "Acquisition Transaction"). Upon the execution of this Agreement, each of
the Company and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and any of their Representatives to, also: (A) immediately cease and terminate
any such discussions or negotiations that are ongoing with any Person other
than Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives; and (B)
promptly disable access to Seller's or the Company's electronic data room or
other diligence access provided to any such other Person in connection with
such discussions; and (C) promptly request the return and/or destruction of
any information furnished to any Person under any Competing NDA. Without the
prior written consent of Buyer, Seller and the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not to, waive any
provision of or release or terminate any confidentiality, non-solicitation or
similar agreements between Seller, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and any other Person (other
than Buyer and its Affiliates), on the other, that was entered into in
connection with any Acquisition Transaction ("Competing NDAs"). From and after
the Signing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall enforce all rights that such Persons have pursuant to
any Competing NDA to the extent relating to the Business, the Company or the
Business Assets.

Section 6.11 Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to
use, their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter.

(b) Buyer will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i)
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter except as expressly contemplated
therein, or (ii) agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or modification
to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision or right under, the Equity
Commitment Letter, except as expressly contemplated therein.

Section 6.12 Transfer of Assets.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, convey, assign, transfer and deliver good and valid title to
each of the assets set forth on Schedule 6.12 (collectively, the "Transferred
Assets"), to the Company, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens, other than Transferred Assets for which such transfer would require a
Consent that has not been obtained. Such transfers shall be effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (such transactions, the "Pre-
Closing Transactions") and pursuant to transfer agreements, assignment
agreements, and other documentation (collectively, the "Pre-Closing
Transaction Documents") in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer. At least 3
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver executed and
final copies of the Pre-Closing Transaction Documents, which agreements shall
be effective immediately prior to Closing.

(b) If, on the Closing Date, any Consent required to consummate the transfer
of a Transferred Asset has not been obtained, Seller and the Company will (i)
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent as
promptly as practicable following the Closing until the date that is twelve
months following the Closing Date and (ii) until the earlier of (x) such
twelve-month anniversary and (y) such time as a relevant Consent is obtained,
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement (1) under which the Company
would obtain the benefits and assume the Liabilities and bear the economic
burdens associated with the relevant Transferred Asset, claim, right
(including the deposit under the San Diego Lease to the extent consent is not
obtained to transfer the San Diego Lease) or benefit in accordance with this
Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the
Company, and (2) under which Seller (or its Subsidiaries) will enforce for the
benefit and account of the Company any and all of the rights with the
associated Transferred Asset, including, in the case of a Contract, the right
to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of
the Company, such that each party is put in the same economic position as if
such Consent had been obtained as of the Closing Date. Seller shall operate
any such Transferred Asset that is a Contract (x) in the Ordinary Course of
Business or (y) as directed by the Company or its Representatives, in each
case, in accordance with the terms of such Contract.

(c) Subject to Section 6.07, this Section 6.12 and the terms of the
Intellectual Property License Agreement and each Parties' retention of copies
of embodiments of Intellectual Property to which it and its Subsidiaries are
licensed thereunder, to the extent that, following the Closing, the Company or
Seller discovers or becomes aware that any Asset (other than Intellectual
Property) owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries is a Business Asset or any Asset
owned by the Company as of the Closing is not a Business Asset, (i) Seller or
the Company shall, or shall cause their Subsidiaries to, transfer and convey (without further
consideration) to the Company or to Seller such Asset, as applicable. Each of
Seller and the Company shall execute such documents or instruments of
conveyance or assumption and take such further acts which are reasonably
necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such Asset such that each
party is put into the same economic position as if such action had been taken
on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent reasonably practicable.

(d) If, during the two years following the Closing Date: (i) Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries receives any payment that is for the account of the Company
in respect of the Business, Seller shall promptly remit (or cause to be
promptly remitted) such funds to Buyer or any entity designated by Buyer and
(ii) Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries receives any payment that is for the
account of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller in respect of Seller's
businesses to the extent not related to the Business, Buyer shall promptly
remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to Seller or any entity
designated by Seller.

(e) If after the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries become aware that they
have retained any copies of physical or tangible materials (including source
code) that, as of the Signing Date or the Closing Date, were exclusively used
in the Business, then Seller or the Subsidiary, as applicable, shall promptly
delete or destroy same within 30 days of becoming so aware. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 6.12(e) shall not require that Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries delete or destroy any materials that (a) are contained in any
backup or archive records or stored pursuant to the document retention or
similar policies of Seller or its Subsidiaries, (b) are required to be
retained pursuant to applicable Law or any Order or in connection with any
pending or threatened Litigation, or (c) for use in connection with the
Transition Services Agreement, provided that in each case, such copies shall
be treated as the Confidential Information of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall also have the
right to retain copies of physical or tangible materials (including source
code) that are included in the Transferred Assets and, as of the Closing Date,
were used by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than in the
Business), provided that in each case, such copies shall be treated as the
Confidential Information of the Company.

(f) If after the Closing, Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, become aware that they have been provided with (or in the case
of the Company, retained) any copies of physical or tangible materials
(including source code) that were not, as of the Signing Date and/or Closing
Date, used in the Business, then Buyer or the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall promptly delete or destroy same within 30 days of becoming
so aware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.12(f) shall not
require that Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries delete
or destroy any materials that (a) are contained in any backup or archive
records or stored pursuant to the document retention or similar policies of
Buyer or the Company, or (b) are required to be retained pursuant to
applicable Law or any Order or in connection with any pending or threatened
Litigation.

(g) Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall, on or prior to
the Closing Date, (i) deliver or make available to the Company copies of or
access to, all source and object code and related technical documentation (x)
included in the Business Assets and (y) for the Licensed Seller Software, and (ii) use commercial reasonable efforts
to deliver or make available to the Company copies of or access to all other
physical or tangible materials included in the Business Assets and that are
material to the operation of the Business, in each case, to the extent not
already in the possession of the Company as of the Closing Date. Subject to
the Transition Services Agreement, to the extent that, following the Closing,
the Company discovers or becomes aware that it does not have a copy of any
physical or tangible materials, including source code or related technical
documentation, included in the Business Assets or for the Licensed Seller
Software, and Company did not have a copy of or access to any such materials
at Closing, then upon Company's reasonable request, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
transfer and convey (without further consideration) copies of such materials,
including source code or related technical documentation, to the Company. To
the extent that, following the Closing, the Seller discovers or becomes aware
that it does not have a copy of any physical or tangible materials, including
source code or related technical documentation included in the Business Assets
and used as of the Closing by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and such
materials were provided to Buyer (or were retained by Company), then upon
Seller's reasonable request, Company shall, or shall cause Buyer and its and
their respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly transfer and convey (without further consideration) copies of such
materials, including source code or related technical documentation, to the
Seller.

Section 6.13 Shared Contracts.

(a) The parties acknowledge that Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company) are parties to certain contracts listed on Schedule 6.13 that relate
to both the operations or conduct of the Business as well as other businesses
of one or more of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) but
that will remain with Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing (the "Shared
Contracts"). Prior to Closing, upon Buyer's written request with respect to
any such Shared Contract, the parties shall cooperate and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to obtain the agreement of the
counterparties to each such Shared Contract to enter into a new contract (or
contract amendment, as applicable), effective as of the Closing Date or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, pursuant to which Buyer or the
Company will receive substantially the same goods, services and Intellectual
Property provided to Seller and its Subsidiaries as of the Signing Date
pursuant to the Shared Contract (the "Shared Contract Rights") on terms and
conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Shared Contract as
of the Signing Date (each, a "Replacement Contract"), (ii) to cause the
applicable counterparty to release Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries from
any obligations of Buyer or the Company under the Shared Contract that become
the obligation of Buyer or the Company under the Replacement Contract and
(iii) to cause the applicable counterparty to release the Company from any
obligations of Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries under the Shared
Contract.

(b) If, on the Closing Date, any Shared Contract has not been separated
pursuant to Section 6.13(a), the parties shall (i) until the date that is
twelve months following the Closing Date, cooperate and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to separate any such Shared
Contract in accordance with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 6.13(a) and
(ii) until the earlier of such time as any such Shared Contract is separated
or the date that is twelve months following the Closing Date, cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement (A) under which the Company would, in compliance with applicable
Law and the terms of the relevant Shared Contract, as applicable, obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations and other Liabilities associated with the
Shared Contract, including through the Transition Services Agreement,
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Company and (B) under which
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall operate any such Shared Contract in the
Ordinary Course of Business in accordance with the terms of such Shared
Contract. At Buyer's written request from time to time, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce for the benefit and account of the
Company any and all of the rights under such Shared Contract, such that in
each case each party is put in the same economic position as if such Shared
Contract had been separated as of the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) no
Replacement Contract shall impose any Liability on Seller or its Affiliates
after the Closing; (ii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required (A) to pay third parties to obtain consent with respect to the
separation of any Shared Contract or entry into a Replacement Contract, or (B)
to commence or participate in any Litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to provide Buyer or
the Company with the benefits under a Shared Contract or with a Replacement
Contract; and (iii) no representation, warranty or covenant (subject to
compliance with Section 6.13(a) and Section 6.13(b)) of Seller contained in
the Transaction Agreements shall be breached, or deemed breached, no condition
shall be deemed not satisfied, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
will have any Liability whatsoever to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, based
on, arising out of or relating to (x) the failure to obtain any Replacement
Contract, (y) any termination of any Shared Contracts or (z) any Litigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any Replacement Contract or the termination
of any Shared Contract.

Section 6.14 Services. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates
currently provide the Company with certain support services (the "Support
Services") including the services to be provided by Seller to Buyer and the
Company under the Transition Services Agreement and the Intellectual Property
License Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that, except for services to be provided
by Seller to Buyer and the Company under the Transition Services Agreement and
the Intellectual Property License Agreement, all Support Services will be
terminated as of the Closing Date.

Section 6.15 Seller Marks. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company), acknowledges and agrees that (a) Buyer is not
purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in
or to any Seller Marks and that Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company) are the exclusive owners of the Seller Marks, (b) neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall have
any rights in or to any Seller Marks, (c) on the Closing Date, Buyer shall and
shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company, to cease use of (and
thereafter not use) the Seller Marks (other than as licensed in this Section
6.15) and (d) Buyer shall not and shall not authorize any Person to (and Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates and, after the Closing, the Company, to not and to
not authorize any Person to), (i) use, register, seek to use or register in
any jurisdiction any of the Seller Marks or any other Marks confusingly similar thereto, (ii) contest the use,
ownership, validity or enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates in or to any of the Seller Marks, or (iii) represent that it has
authority to bind Seller or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for a period not to exceed 120 days immediately following the
Closing Date, Seller hereby non-exclusively licenses the Company to use the
Seller Marks that were used in the conduct of the Business as of the Closing
Date in the Ordinary Course of Business, in the same manner, and for the same
purpose, as such Seller Marks were used by the Company in such conduct of the
Business and only with respect to materials containing such Seller Marks as of
the Closing, solely for purposes of winding down the Company's use of such
Seller Marks in connection with the Business. The foregoing permitted use is
subject to compliance by the Company with the quality control requirements in
effect for the Seller Marks as of the Closing Date. The Company shall, within
120 days after the Closing Date, destroy or exhaust all materials bearing the
Seller Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials,
packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, business cards,
website content, invoices, receipts, forms, product, training and service
literature and materials and other materials (collectively, "Materials"), or
shall alter such Materials so as to remove the Seller Marks. Any goodwill
arising from the use of any of the Seller Marks by the Company as described in
this Section 6.15 shall inure to the benefit of Seller. For clarity, nothing
in this Section 6.15 shall prohibit the Company from use of the Seller Marks
after Closing (i) in historical documents, contracts or records or internal
business materials, in all cases that exist as of the Closing Date and solely
for internal purposes, (ii) in a neutral, non-trademark manner to describe the
history of the Company or the Business and (iii) as required by applicable
Law.

Section 6.16 Termination of Affiliate Transactions. Except for (i) the
Transaction Agreements, (ii) Contracts specified in Schedule 6.16 or (iii)
Liabilities pursuant to employment relationships and the payment of
compensation and benefits, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
prior to the Closing Date or in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, terminate and settle in full (without any payments by the
Company following the Cut-off Time) all Contracts or pre-Closing transactions
(other than intercompany Indebtedness settled at the Closing) between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, such that as of the Cut-off Time, all such Contracts and pre-Closing
transactions (other than intercompany Indebtedness settled at the Closing)
shall be of no further force or effect and without any liability to the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Company, following the Cut-off Time)
or Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.17 Resignation of Officers and Directors. Seller shall cause (to be
effective as of or prior to Closing) the resignation or removal of the
officers and directors of the Company any Person who is not a Continuing
Employee.

Section 6.18 Bank Accounts. Seller shall cause (to be effective as of or prior
to Closing) the removal of any Person who is not a Continuing Employee as a
Person authorized to draw thereupon or who have access to any accounts
maintained by the Company (each, a "Bank Account").

by Seller as of the Closing Date in the United States.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.19 shall not prohibit any

Person, directly or indirectly (x) solicit, endeavor to entice away from or
otherwise knowingly encourage to leave the employ or service of the Business,
the Company, Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer, (y) offer employment or a
consulting position to, or (y) hire, any Person who was a MyCase Service

following the Closing Date, (x) any general public solicitation of employment
or contracting through advertising or through an executive search firm that is
not directed at or to Persons who were MyCase Service Providers or employees
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be (but not the offering

of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
solicitation, offer of employment or hiring of any employee who was terminated

to the Business or the Business Liabilities that relate to the period prior to
the Closing (such events or circumstances, an "Insurance Matter") that are
eligible for coverage under Seller's or its Subsidiaries' insurance policies,
after the Closing, the Company may make claims (to the extent permitted in
accordance with the terms and conditions of Seller's or its Subsidiaries'
existing insurance policies), or if requested by the Company, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to make claims, under such policies with
respect to such Insurance Matter. Buyer shall (i) promptly reimburse Seller
and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or its

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION



Section 8.01 Survival. Intending to modify any applicable statute of
limitations, the parties agree that (i) the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) the covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this
Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Closing, including
rights arising out of any breach of such representations and warranties,
covenants, obligations and agreements, shall terminate effective as of the
Closing and not survive the Closing. Upon Closing, there shall be no Liability
on the part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any Person in respect of any
such breach of any representations and warranties, or covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement required to be performed
at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Post-Closing
Covenants shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms
or, if none is specified, the applicable statute of limitations. The
applicable survival periods described in this Section 8.01 supersede all
applicable statute of limitations with respect to each such representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement, and any claim brought by any
party pursuant to this Article VIII must be brought or filed prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period. The expiration of an applicable
survival period with respect to the Post-Closing Covenants set forth in this
Section 8.01 shall not affect any then pending claim for indemnification under
this Article VIII, as long as such claim was brought within the applicable
survival period in accordance with this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.01 shall limit any claim for Actual
Fraud.

Section 8.02 Indemnification by Seller. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless, Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the
Company), and each of Buyer's and any of its Affiliates' respective
Affiliates, equityholders, directors, officers, managers, members, partners,
employees, successors and assigns (each, a "Buyer Indemnitee") from and
against any Losses, whether or not related to any Third Party Claim, incurred
or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or by
reason of any of the following:

(a) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenants of Seller;

(b) any Excluded Liability; and

(c) (i) any Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; (ii) all Taxes relating to
the ownership or operation of the Business or the acquisition, ownership, or
sale of any Transferred Asset in any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of
a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, (iii) any Taxes of Seller or of
any other Person for which the Company is liable, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local
or non-U.S. Law, as a result of being a member of a consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar group including Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other
than the Company (including the affiliated group of which Seller is the common
parent) on or prior to the Closing Date, or as a successor or transferee or
otherwise as a matter of Law to the extent arising from a transaction or event
occurring prior to the Closing; (iv) any payments required to be made by the
Company or any following the Closing Date pursuant to any Tax allocation, Tax
indemnity, or Tax sharing agreement entered into by the Company prior to the
Closing (other than any such agreements solely among the Company or any
customary agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that do
not primarily relate to Tax matters); (v) any Taxes arising from or imposed in
connection with the transfer, conveyance or assignment of the Transferred
Assets or the settlement of intercompany accounts pursuant to Section 6.16,
and (vi) any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to
Section 6.08(a); provided that, in each case, Seller shall not be responsible
for any Taxes of any Person resulting from an action taken by Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates on the Closing Date but
following the Closing that is outside the Ordinary Course of Business other than any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, that is taken with the consent of Seller, or the Section
338(h)(10) Election (any Taxes described in this proviso, the "Excluded
Taxes").

Section 8.03 Indemnification by the Company. From and after the Closing, Buyer
and the Company shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless,
Seller, any of its Affiliates, and each of Seller's and any of its Affiliates'
respective Affiliates, equityholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
partners, employees, successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnitee") from
and against any Losses, whether or not related to any Third Party Claim,
incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or by reason of any of the following:

(a) any breach of any Post-Closing Covenants of Buyer or the Company;

(b) any Business Liability; and

(c) any Excluded Taxes.

Section 8.04 Indemnity Procedures.

(a) Any Person entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly give written notice to the party from whom
indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of any pending or
threatened Litigation against the Indemnified Party that has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to such right of indemnification with
respect to such Litigation (a "Third Party Claim"), indicating, with
reasonable specificity, the nature of such Third Party Claim, the basis
therefor, a copy of any documentation received from the third party, the
amount and calculation of the Losses for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII (and a good-faith estimate
of any such future Losses relating thereto), and the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such Losses shall have occurred. The Indemnified
Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party any information or
documentation related to the foregoing reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to
tender the defense of the Litigation in a timely manner pursuant to this
Section 8.04(a) shall not limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this Article VIII, except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced thereby and (ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during the
period in which notice was not provided.

(b) With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to assume the control and defense, at its
own expense and by counsel of its own choosing, of such Third Party Claim and
any Third Party Claims related to the same or a substantially similar set of
facts by notifying the Indemnified Party within twenty days after the receipt
by the Indemnifying Party of a notice of such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the control and defense of such Third Party Claim,
and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party, if (i) such Third Party Claim is a criminal Litigation,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing that it is obligated to
pay Losses arising from or related to such Third Party Claim (subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article VIII). If the Indemnifying Party so undertakes to
control and defend any such Third Party Claim, it shall notify the Indemnified
Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against,
and settlement of, any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement does not involve any injunctive
relief against or any finding or admission of any violation of Law or
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, and any money damages are borne solely by
the Indemnifying Party. Subject to the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in but not
control the defense of such Litigation at its own cost and expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement and
subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the reasonable fees of one firm of legal counsel (and one additional firm
of legal counsel in each jurisdiction implicated in such Litigation)
representing all Indemnified Parties in such Litigation and all related
Litigations, if, but only if, the defendants in such Litigation include both
an Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of legal counsel, that
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Litigation. In any event, the
Indemnified Party shall cause its legal counsel to reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its legal counsel and shall not assert any position
in any Litigation inconsistent with that asserted by the Indemnifying Party.
No Indemnified Party may settle any Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the control
and defense of a Third Party Claim within twenty days after the receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of a notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified
Party, it shall nevertheless be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Litigation at its own cost and expense, and the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
defense against, and settlement of, any such Third Party Claim.

(c) If any Indemnified Party has or may have an indemnification claim against
any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof
to the Indemnifying Party indicating, with reasonable specificity, the nature
of such claim, the basis therefor, the amount and calculation of the Losses
for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Article VIII (and a good-faith estimate of any such future Losses relating
thereto), and the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Losses
shall have occurred. The Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party any information or documentation related to the foregoing
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. A failure by the Indemnified
Party to give notice in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.04(c) shall
not limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII,
except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby and
(ii) to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was
not provided. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to
such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in the appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction set forth in Section 10.08.

(d) This Section 8.04 shall not apply to claims with respect to Tax matters to
the extent inconsistent with Section 6.08(f).

Section 8.05 Limitations on Indemnification; No Duplication; Other Matters.

(a) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Article
VIII shall be calculated net of (i) any insurance proceeds actually received
covering such Losses that are the subject of the claim for indemnification
(net of any costs of recovery and any increase in premiums), and (ii) all
indemnity, contribution and similar payments received by the Indemnified Party
(or its parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from third parties in respect of
any such claim (net of any costs of recovery). The Indemnified Party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies for
any Losses prior to seeking to collect any amounts under Article VIII. If the
Indemnified Party (or its parent or any of its Subsidiaries) receives any such
payment from a third party with respect to a claim after it has already
received an indemnification payment on account of such claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal to
the excess (if any, and solely up to the amount such Indemnifying Party has
paid) of (x) the amount paid by or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party
in respect of such claim, plus the amount received from the third party in
respect thereof (net of any cost of recovery, including any increase in
premiums) less (y) the full amount of such Loss. Any Liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication or recovery
by reason of the same Loss.

(b) Payments by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss will be reduced
by an amount equal to (i) any Tax benefit for state or local income Tax
purposes to the extent realized or reasonably expected to be realized (within
the taxable year in which the Loss was incurred or the immediately following
two taxable years) as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party, less
(ii) any Tax detriment (including any reduction in depreciation or
amortization) realized or reasonably expected to be realized as a result of
such Loss by the Indemnified Party.

(c) In no event will any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover any
punitive, exemplary, speculative damages, damages that are not reasonably
foreseeable or any damages based on any type of multiple (except to the extent
any Indemnified Party is liable for the same pursuant to any Third Party
Claim).

(d) In no event will any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover any Losses
to the extent such Losses (i) were reserved for in the Financial Statements,
(ii) are taken into account in the calculation of Final Closing Working
Capital or (iii) are included in the calculation of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount.

(e) In no event will an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover for any
Losses relating to such Indemnified Party's (or its Affiliates') own general
and administrative time, allocation of personnel wages, other overhead
expenses or other similar internal costs. (f) In no event will the aggregate amount of all Losses that an Indemnifying
Party may be required to indemnify exceed (i) 10% of the Aggregate Purchase
Price with respect to all Losses with respect to clauses (a) and (b) of the
definition of Excluded Liabilities and (ii) the Aggregate Purchase Price with
respect to all Losses subject to indemnification under this Article VIII.

Section 8.06 Payment. Upon a determination of liability under this Article
VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified
Party the amount so determined within five Business Days after the date of
such determination.

Section 8.07 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. The parties shall
treat any payment under this Article VIII as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 8.08 Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all indemnifiable Losses after becoming aware
of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder.

Section 8.09 Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that following the Closing, its and its Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all Transaction Litigation, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise,
shall be exclusively pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 6.06,
Section 6.08, this Article VIII, Section 10.11 and the other Transaction
Agreements, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
any party be restricted in seeking (i) any non-monetary remedy with respect to
the Post-Closing Covenants or (ii) any remedy in the case of Actual Fraud.

Section 8.10 Representation and Warranty Insurance. If Buyer or any of its
Affiliates obtains a purchaser-side representations and warranties policy in
connection with the Transaction (the "RWI Policy"), such policy shall contain
an irrevocable, unconditional waiver by the insurer of its subrogation rights
against Seller and the other Seller Related Parties, except in the event of
Actual Fraud. The RWI Policy shall also contain a provision that Seller and
the other Seller Related Parties are third-party beneficiaries of the waiver
described in this Section 8.10. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into or consent to, any amendment to, or
termination, cancellation or revocation of, the RWI Policy that could increase
the liability of Seller or any other Seller Related Parties.

Article IX

TERMINATION



Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Buyer or Seller at any time after 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the
Termination Date if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such
date; provided that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(b) if such party's material breach of
this Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to
occur prior to the Termination Date;

(c) by either Buyer or Seller, if any Order or Law permanently prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions shall have become final and non-appealable;

(d) by Buyer, if any representation or warranty set forth in Article III or
Article IV shall be or shall have become inaccurate or Seller or the Company
shall have breached or failed to perform any of their respective covenants set
forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would
reasonably be expected to give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.02, and which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
cannot be cured by the Company or Seller, as applicable, or, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) the
Business Day prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is 30
calendar days after receipt by the Company of notice in writing from Buyer
specifying the nature of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform and
requesting that it be cured;

(e) by Seller, if any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article
V shall be or shall have become inaccurate or Buyer shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement (including
to purchase the Shares in accordance with Section 2.01), which inaccuracy,
breach or failure to perform would reasonably be expected to give rise to the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03, and which
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform cannot be cured by Buyer or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i)
the Business Day prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is 30
calendar days after receipt by Buyer of notice in writing from Seller
specifying the nature of such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform and
requesting that it be cured; or

(f) by Seller, if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section
7.02 have been satisfied (other than any condition that requires the delivery
of a document or certificate or the taking of any action at the Closing), (ii)
Seller has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Buyer that (A) all
conditions set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied (other than any
condition that requires the delivery of a document or certificate or the
taking of any action at the Closing) or that it and the Company are willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.03, and (B) it and the Company
are ready, willing, and able to consummate the Closing and (iii) Buyer fails
to consummate the Closing within three Business Days after the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02.

Neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(c) if such party's or any of its Affiliates' failure to perform
in all material respects any covenants of such party set forth in this
Agreement was the primary cause for the issuance of the Order. Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(d) if Buyer is then in breach of this Agreement and such breach would
reasonably be expected to give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.03.

Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(e) if Seller or the Company is then in breach of this Agreement
and such breach would reasonably be expected to give rise to the failure of
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of clause (b),
(c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 9.01 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with Section 10.01 specifying the
provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected
(a "Termination Notice").

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination; Etc. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 9.01, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and
have no effect and the Transactions shall be abandoned. In the event of such
termination, there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer,
the Company or Seller except that: (i) Article I, this Section 9.02, Article X
(other than Section 10.12), and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
termination of this Agreement and remain valid and binding obligations of each
of the parties; and (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01 shall not release any party from any liability for any liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by another party, to the extent such liabilities
or damages were the result of the knowing and willful and material breach by
such party of this Agreement or Actual Fraud. If Buyer fails to fulfill its
obligations to consummate the Transactions on the date the Closing is required
to occur pursuant to Section 2.02, such failure to consummate the Transactions
on such date shall be deemed to be a knowing and willful and material breach
of this Agreement.

such party. Each party may change the address by which proper notice shall be
given pursuant to this Section 10.01 by providing notice to the other parties
in accordance with this Section 10.01.

Section 10.02 Amendment; Waiver, Etc. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, modification or supplement, by Buyer, the Company and Seller, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Section 10.03 Assignment. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no
party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company and Seller,
and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent shall be void
and of no effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate so long as such assignment does not
cause any delay in consummating the Closing. Any such assignment shall not
release Buyer from its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.04 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements, the Annexes,
Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior representations, agreements, term
sheets, letters of intent and understandings, oral or written, with respect to
such matters.

Section 10.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that any term or other provision hereof is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, Buyer, the Company and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner so that the
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 10.06 Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Whether
expressly or by implication, except as set forth in clause (b) below, nothing
in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, the
Company and Seller, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, except as set forth in Section 10.06(b), no Person shall be a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

(b) The limitations in Section 10.06(a) shall not apply to the provisions of:

(i) Section 6.06, to the extent it applies to DandO Indemnified Persons, which
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely
on, such section;

(ii) Section 10.12, to the extent it applies to Kirkland, which shall be an
express third-party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such
section;

(iii) Section 10.15, to the extent it applies to the Buyer Released Persons or
the Seller Released Persons, as applicable, which shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such section; and (iv) Section 10.17, to the extent it applies to Non-Party Affiliates, which
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely
on, such section.

Section 10.07 Expenses. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
borne by the party incurring such expenses.

Section 10.08 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement and any Transaction Litigation shall be governed by and
enforced pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to rules of conflict of laws that would result in the application of Laws of
any other jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in
any Transaction Litigation that is brought by any such party or its successors
or assigns. Each party irrevocably agrees and consents to the service of any
and all process in any such Transaction Litigation by the delivery of such
process in the manner provided in Section 10.01. To the fullest extent it may
legally do so, each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any Transaction Litigation in the Chosen Courts.
Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Chosen Court that any such Transaction Litigation brought in any
Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. No party shall bring
or support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any
Transaction Litigation (including any cross claim or third party claim) of any
kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, in any forum other than the Chosen Courts. Any final and
nonappealable judgment against any party in any Transaction Litigation shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside
the United States by suit on judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(b) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Transaction Litigation. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that (i) no Representative of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, if there
is any Litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) such
party makes this waiver voluntarily and (iv) each other party has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certificates in this Section 10.08(b).

Section 10.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature. Section 10.10 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the Interim Period, at the request of any party and, except
as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, without further consideration, each
other party shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such documents
and take such other action as such requesting party may reasonably request in
order to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable, including
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VII.

Section 10.11 Remedies.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement are uniquely related to the desire of the
parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the Transactions. The
Transactions represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each
of the parties and their respective Affiliates. As a result, irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms. Although monetary damages may be available for the
breach of such covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be difficult
to ascertain and an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Accordingly, if
Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, breaches or threatens to
breach any provision of this Agreement, Seller or the Company, on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and all other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide, furnish or post any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such order or injunction. Each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or other security. If any Litigation should be
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement no party shall
allege, and each party waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law. The rights in this Section 10.11 are in addition to any other remedy to
which a party may be entitles at law or in equity, and the exercise by a party
of one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) To the extent any party brings any Litigation to enforce specifically the
performance of the other party's obligation to consummate the Closing when
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended to: (i) the 5th Business Day
following the resolution of such Litigation by a final, non-appealable Order
by the court presiding over such Litigation, if later than the date the
Termination Date would otherwise occur pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; or (ii) such other time period established in a final, non-
appealable Order by the court presiding over such Litigation. The extension of
the Termination Date set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not
apply to any action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement.

Section 10.12 Waiver of Conflicts. Kirkland, Polsinelli LLP, and Global
Immigration Associates, P.C. (each, a "Transaction Counsel") have acted as
legal counsel to the Company, Seller and certain of its respective Affiliates
prior to the Signing Date, and the Transaction Counsel intend to act as legal
counsel to Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than the Company) (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") after the
Closing. In recognition of the foregoing, each of Buyer and the Company
expressly waives, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, stockholder, officers, employees and Affiliates and agrees to cause
its directors, members, partners, stockholder, officers, employees and
Affiliates, and the Company to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with any Transaction Counsel representing the Seller Group after
the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Company or the
Transactions. All communications involving attorney-client confidences between
Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Transaction Counsel, on the other hand, relating to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Transactions shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and its respective
Affiliates (and not the Company). Accordingly, neither Buyer, nor the Company
shall have access to or will seek to obtain any such communications or the
files of any Transaction Counsel relating to such engagement from and after
the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a)
Seller and its respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
the Company shall not be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of any
Transaction Counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only Seller and its respective Affiliates (and not the Company) shall
hold such property rights and (c) no Transaction Counsel shall have any duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to the Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
such Transaction Counsel and the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company is not waiving any attorney-client privilege (including relating to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions) in
connection with any third party Litigation.

Section 10.13 Disclaimer.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties of Seller expressly set forth in Article III,

the Transactions.

warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Article IV or any certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c), none of Seller, the Company, or any

warranty, statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including with respect to any
express or implied representation or warranty as to the merchantability,

its Affiliates, that in determining to enter into and consummate this
Agreement and the Transactions, it is not relying upon, expressly disclaims

due diligence call, meeting or discussion, estimate, projection or forecast or
similar materials). None of the foregoing materials, nor any all similar
materials shall be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties.

Agreement shall relieve Buyer, Seller or the Company from any liability in the
case of Actual Fraud.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties of Buyer expressly set forth in Article V or
any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b) are and shall constitute
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties made with respect to

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article V or any certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(b), none of Buyer or any other Person has made or is
making any express or implied representations or warranty relating to Buyer,
statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including with respect to any express
or implied representation or warranty as to Buyer or business or the assets or
liabilities of Buyer.

(g) Seller represents, warrants, covenants and agrees, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that in determining to enter into and consummate this
Agreement and the Transactions, it is not relying upon, expressly disclaims
reliance upon and has not been induced by, any representation or warranty made
or purportedly made by or on behalf of any Person, other than those expressly
made by Buyer as set forth in Article V or any certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 2.04(b).

Section 10.14 Due Diligence Review and Disclaimer. Buyer represents, warrants,
and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that:

(a) it is a sophisticated purchaser and, together with its own expert advisors
including legal counsel, has completed its own analysis, and due diligence
investigation, and formed its own independent judgment with respect to the
Company; (b) it has been furnished with or given access to such documents and
information about the Company and its businesses and operations as it and its
Representatives have deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transactions;

(c) in entering into this Agreement, it has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of (i)
Seller expressly contained in Article III and Article IV and any certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c), in each case as qualified by the
Schedules;

(d) other than the representations and warranties contained in Article III and
Article IV and any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c), no
representation or warranty of any kind or nature expressed or implied has been
or is being made, whether directly or indirectly, by Seller, the Company or
any other Person as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information
provided or made available to Buyer or any of its Representatives, including
the accuracy or completeness of any information contained in any data room,
management presentation, due diligence call, meeting or discussion, estimate,
projection or forecast or similar materials and Buyer expressly disclaims
reliance on any of the foregoing; and

(e) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans, budgets and similar materials and information.

Section 10.15 Release.

(a) As of the Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates, and the Company (each, a "Buyer Releasing Person"), irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely releases and forever discharges Seller and its
respective Affiliates, and each other Seller Related Party (each, a "Buyer

nature, both at law and in equity, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued,
that have been or could have been asserted against any Buyer Released Person,

way relates to events, circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken
prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of matters directly or
indirectly relating to the operation of the Company or the Business by Seller
prior to the Closing, except for (i) any claims, rights or obligations arising
under this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, including any claims or
causes of action arising out of Actual Fraud, and (ii) any Buyer Released
Person's status as a MyCase Service Provider.

(b) As of the Closing, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries (each, a "Seller Releasing Person"), irrevocably, unconditionally

Agreement and the Transaction Agreements.

(c) Each of Seller, Buyer and the Company:

(i) represents and warrants that it is fully aware of the provisions of
California Civil Code § 1542, which provides as follows: "A general release
does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release
and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor or released party."

(ii) expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits that the Buyer
Releasing Persons or the Seller Releasing Persons, as applicable may have
under applicable Law, including any state Law (including the above referenced
California Civil Code section) or any common Law principles limiting waivers
of unknown claims,

(iii) understands that the facts and circumstances under which such Person
gives this irrevocable and unconditional full and complete release and
discharge of the Buyer Released Persons or the Company, as applicable may
later prove to be different than now known or believed to be true by such
Person and

(iv) accepts and assumes the risk thereof and agrees that the Buyer Releasing
Persons' or the Seller Releasing Persons', as applicable irrevocable and
unconditional full and complete release and discharge of the Buyer Released
Persons or the Company, as applicable with respect to the matters described in
this Section 10.15 shall remain effective in all respects and not be subject
to termination, rescission or modification by reason of any such difference in
facts and circumstances.

Section 10.16 Public Statements. Except for any joint press release to be
mutually agreed upon, Seller, Buyer, and the Company shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates and Representatives to not, make any public
announcements in respect of the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions or
otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of
the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). No press release or other public announcement,
statement or comment relating to the Transaction Agreements or the
Transactions shall be issued, made or permitted to be issued or made by any
party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives without the prior written
consent of Seller and Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any press release
or other public announcement or statement relating to the Transactions
Agreements or the Transactions is required by applicable Law or stock exchange
requirements on which such party or its Affiliates lists or trades securities,
such disclosing party shall consult with the non-disclosing parties in advance
of such disclosure and provide the non-disclosing parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any such release, announcement or
statement and consider in good faith any such comments with respect thereto.
In addition: (a) Seller may disclose information regarding the Transactions
which it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a public company, including pursuant to filings with the SEC
(including filing a copy of this Agreement) and to Seller's securities
analysts and institutional investors in press interviews, (b) any party may
disclose the Transactions and the total enterprise value of the Company
implied by the Transaction to its investors and potential investors in the
Ordinary Course of Business and to its Representatives; and (c) any party or
its equityholders who is an investment fund may disclose the terms of this
Agreement or the Transactions to its Affiliates, lenders and any current or
potential investor in such party's fund(s) in connection with its fundraising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities, or otherwise in the ordinary
course of such party's business, so long as such recipients are obligated to
keep such information confidential. Nothing in this Section 10.16 shall
prohibit any disclosure (i) required under the Credit Agreement or any other
Contract to which Seller is a party (including for the purpose of seeking a
counterparty's Consent to the Transactions or as contemplated by Section 6.12
or Section 6.13) provided such disclosure to counterparties discloses only
information which is consistent with any public announcements with respect to
the Transaction previously agreed upon with Buyer, or (ii) by Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries to their respective employees;
provided such disclosure to employees is consistent with substantive
communications previously agreed upon with the other party.

Section 10.17 No Recourse. Without regard to whether any claim or cause of
action sounds in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute, all Transaction Litigation may be made only against (and are
expressly limited to) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties to
this Agreement (the "Contracting Parties"). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any past, present or future Representative, stockholder or
Affiliate of a Contracting Party or any past, present or future
Representative, stockholder or Affiliate of, or financial advisor or lender
to, or successor or assignee any of the foregoing ("Non Party Affiliates"),
shall have any Liability directly or indirectly arising under, out of, in
connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance or breach. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, each
Contracting Party waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims, causes of
action and obligations. Without limiting the foregoing and without limiting
the rights of any Contracting Party against the other Contracting Parties, in
no event shall any Contracting Party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against or make any claims relating to any Transaction
Litigation against, or seek to recover from any Non-Party Affiliates. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Non Party Affiliates are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 10.17.

Section 10.18 Confidentiality.

(a) Duty of Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, each party will
protect the Confidential Information of the other party using the same degree
of care it would use with respect to its own confidential and proprietary
information. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, keep
confidential and not disclose to any Person, without the applicable party's
prior written consent, all Confidential Information of such other party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right, without the prior written
consent of the other applicable parties, to disclose Confidential Information
to any of its Representatives who (i) need to know the Confidential
Information and (ii) are informed of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information. Such party shall be liable for any breach of the
confidentiality obligations under this Section 10.18 by any such
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the extent there is any
conflict between the terms of this Section 10.18 and the confidentiality
obligations pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement shall control with respect to the information to
which the Transaction Services Agreement applies, and (ii) neither party shall
be prohibited by this Section 10.18 from disclosing or otherwise using its
owned or licensed Intellectual Property, pursuant to the terms of the
Intellectual Property License Agreement or otherwise.

(b) Required Disclosure. If a party or any of its Representatives is requested
or required to disclose any Confidential Information pursuant to any
applicable Law or Order or pursuant to judicial process or any securities
exchange rule, such party shall promptly notify the other applicable party in
writing (to the extent permitted by Law), take commercially reasonable steps
to request that the Confidential Information not be disclosed to non-parties
or the public, and shall reasonably cooperate with the other applicable party
in taking legally available steps to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other appropriate remedy is
not obtained, the disclosing party or its Representatives, as applicable, may
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that, on the advice
of its counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and upon the request of
the applicable party, shall request assurances and reasonably cooperate with
the other applicable party in its efforts to ensure that confidential
treatment will be accorded to Confidential Information disclosed in such
manner.
