10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP, 201
East Fourth Street, Suite 1900, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, on a date to be
specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than five (5) Business
Days after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the

another time, place or date, or any or all, are agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as
the "Closing Date".

2.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
South Carolina (the "South Carolina Secretary") and the certificate of merger
to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the "Ohio

Merger.

2.4 Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the South Carolina Business Corporation Act of
1988, as amended ("SCBCA"), and the Ohio General Corporation Law ("OGCL").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of CABF shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of CABF shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, without par value, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Parent and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

2.5 Articles of Incorporation and Regulations of the Surviving Corporation.
The articles of incorporation of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become and remain the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable laws. The

shall become and remain the regulations of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable laws.



2.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective
Time:

(a) The directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of whom shall serve as
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the next annual meeting of
shareholders and until such time as their respective successors have been duly
elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
from office.

(b) The executive officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the executive
officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of whom shall
serve until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and regulations of the Surviving Corporation.

2.7 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, CABF or the holder of any of the
following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.9(e), each share of CABF's common stock, par value
$1.00 per share (collectively, the "CABF Common Stock"), except for Excluded
Shares and Appraisal Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive the
following, without interest:

(i) 0.1378 shares of (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock; and

(ii) $3.80 in cash (the "Per Share Cash Consideration") (the consideration
described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Cancellation of Shares. Shares of CABF Common Stock, when converted in
accordance with Section 2.7(a), shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive in respect of each share of CABF Common Stock
previously represented thereby (i) the consideration set forth in Section
2.7(a), (ii) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section
2.9(c), and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.9(e), in each case without
interest, and in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with
Section 2.9.

(c) Treasury Stock; Excluded Shares. All shares of CABF Common Stock held by
CABF as treasury shares or by Parent or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or CABF immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares
held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and
(ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, CABF or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or CABF in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and



no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor (all such shares,
the "Excluded Shares").

2.8 Treatment of CABF Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time (i) each CABF Stock Option that has an exercise
price per share that is less than $19.00 (a "CABF Exercisable Option") shall
be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive (without
interest) the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 in respect
of the Net Share amount with respect to such CABF Stock Option, less
applicable Tax withholdings, and treating the Net Shares in the same manner as
all other shares of CABF Common Stock for such purposes and (ii) each CABF
Stock Option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or
equal to $19.00 shall be assumed and converted automatically into an option
(an "Adjusted Stock Option") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such CABF Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including vesting terms), the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of CABF Common
Stock subject to such CABF Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock
Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to
the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1)
the exercise price per share of CABF Common Stock subject to such CABF Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Prior to the Effective Time, CABF shall enter into option
cancellation agreements (the "Option Cancellation Agreements") with all
holders of CABF Exercisable Options granted pursuant to the CABF Stock Plans,
each in a form mutually agreed upon by CABF and Parent, and shall take all
such further action as is necessary to allow the CABF Exercisable Options to
be cancelled and converted into the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Net Share" shall mean, with respect to a CABF Stock Option, the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of (x) the excess, if any, of
$19.00 over the per share exercise price of such CABF Stock Option multiplied
by (y) the number of shares of CABF Common Stock subject to such CABF Stock
Option, by (ii) $19.00. Furthermore, for purposes of this Agreement, "Equity
Award Exchange Ratio" shall mean the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii)
the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing the Per
Share Cash Consideration by the Parent Signing Date Share Price.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the Closing),
each award in respect of a share of CABF Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a CABF Stock Plan that is
unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a "CABF Restricted Stock Award" and, together with the CABF Stock Options,
the "CABF Equity Awards") shall fully vest (with any performance-based vesting
condition applicable to such CABF Restricted Stock Award deemed satisfied to
the extent provided in the applicable award agreement) and shall be canceled
and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.7 on the shares of CABF Common Stock underlying
such



CABF Restricted Stock Award, treating the shares of CABF Common Stock subject
to such CABF Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of
CABF Common Stock for such purposes. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the CABF Restricted Stock Awards all such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax law.

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to the settlement of CABF
Equity Awards contemplated by this Section 2.8. Immediately following the
Effective Time, to the extent required by the SEC, Parent shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Adjusted Stock Options, shall distribute a
prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such Adjusted Stock Options remain outstanding.

(d) Each holder of a CABF Equity Award converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration that would have otherwise been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares to be
delivered to such holder pursuant to Section 2.7 and this Section 2.8) shall
receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment (rounded
to the nearest cent) (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) multiplied by the Parent Closing Date Share
Price.

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, CABF, the Board of Directors of CABF
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.8.

2.9 Exchange of CABF Common Stock.

(a) Exchange Agent. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions,
Inc. and/or such other agent as determined by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to CABF (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
CABF Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II through
the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent Common Stock to make all
deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as required by this ARTICLE II,
pursuant to an exchange agent agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent
(the "Exchange Agent Agreement") in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and
CABF. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.9(c) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.9(e). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.9(c) and fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.9(e)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund".



The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of CABF Common Stock
and CABF Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, provided that (i) such investments shall be in
obligations, funds or accounts customary (including with respect to liquidity)
for transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of shares of CABF Common Stock or holders of CABF
Equity Awards. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the
Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
and in no event more than ten (10) calendar days after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or Book Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of CABF Common
Stock that has been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE II (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the shares of CABF Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the corresponding certificates (the "Certificates")
representing such shares to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange
Agent of an "agent's message" with respect to non-certificated shares
represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares"), and shall be in customary
form as directed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to CABF), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of CABF Common Stock represented thereby. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such Certificates or
Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon
completion of the calculations required by Section 2.7(a), (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of CABF Common
Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject
to, Section 2.7(a) and (B) a check or wire of immediately available funds in
the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of (i) the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with, and subject to, Section
2.7(a), and (ii) dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.9(c)
and cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.9(e). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration. The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver certificated or book entry shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration (or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares) to which a holder of Parent Common Stock would otherwise be entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares representing the shares of CABF Common Stock for



exchange as provided in this Section 2.9, or an appropriate affidavit of loss
and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each
case by Parent. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of CABF
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of CABF, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of CABF Common Stock
may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
CABF Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable, good
faith discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of
the letters of transmittal and compliance by any CABF Shareholder or any
holder of a CABF Equity Award with the requirements set forth herein, (ii) the
method of issuance and delivery of Parent Common Stock, either certificated or
in book entry, into which shares of CABF Common Stock are converted in the
Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash into which shares of CABF
Common Stock are converted in the Merger and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged CABF Common Stock. No dividends
or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in accordance with this ARTICLE II. After the surrender of a
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with this ARTICLE II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock which the shares of CABF
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Share have been
converted into the right to receive.

(d) Further Rights in CABF Common Stock. The Merger Consideration issued upon
conversion of a share of CABF Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.9(e)) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of
CABF Common Stock.

(e) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest
shall relate to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of CABF Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest



whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Parent
Closing Date Share Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.7 hereof.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of CABF Common Stock after one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders of
CABF Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have not theretofore
complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of CABF Common Stock.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of CABF Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, thereupon become the property of Parent free and
clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(g) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder of shares of CABF Common Stock for any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Authority in the
reasonable belief that such delivery was required pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of CABF
Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(i) Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CABF Common Stock, any
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.9 or any
other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of CABF Common Stock or CABF Equity Awards such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of CABF Common Stock or CABF Equity Awards in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.



(j) Book Entry. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates; provided
that Parent may issue any of such shares in physical form at its sole
discretion.

2.10 Certain Adjustments. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior
to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or CABF
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of
securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in
respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event
occurs, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide to
the holders thereof the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such adjustment event.

2.11 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in CABF Common Stock. At the
Closing Date, the stock transfer books of CABF shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of CABF Common
Stock on the records of CABF, except for the cancellation of such shares in
connection with the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of CABF Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, bona fide Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this ARTICLE II.

2.12 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of CABF Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time as to which the holder of such shares shall have (i) not
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing, (ii) properly
complied with the provisions of the SCBCA as to dissenters' rights and any
other Applicable Law and (iii) not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's
rights to dissent/appraisal (each, an "Appraisal Share"), if any, shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.7, but instead at the Effective Time shall become the right to
payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of the SCBCA. At the Effective Time,
all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
(A) fails to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent/appraisal under the SCBCA, (B) fails to establish his entitlement to
dissent/appraisal rights as provided in the SCBCA, or (C) fails to take any
action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment
for his shares under the SCBCA or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the
SCBCA, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under the SCBCA shall be forfeited and cease and if
such forfeiture shall occur following the Closing Date, each of such holder's
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive, without interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7. CABF shall deliver prompt
notice to Parent of any exercise of dissenters' rights or demands for
appraisal of any shares of CABF Common Stock and provide Parent with the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
exercise



of dissenter's rights or demands for appraisal under the SCBCA. Prior to the
Effective Time, CABF shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.13 Proxy and Registration Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Parent and CABF shall prepare the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form, which Parent
shall file with the SEC and will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each
of Parent and CABF shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. CABF will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to CABF Shareholders as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and CABF shall furnish all
information concerning CABF and the holders of CABF Common Stock, or holders
of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Parent will advise CABF promptly after it receives oral
or written notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and
will promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from
the SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to Parent or CABF, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or CABF
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to CABF Shareholders.

2.14 CABF Shareholders' Meeting.

(a) CABF shall take all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Law and
CABF's current articles of incorporation and bylaws to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "CABF Shareholders'
Meeting"), to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, for the purposes of
obtaining the approval of CABF Shareholders to adopt this Agreement. The Board
of Directors of CABF has resolved to recommend to CABF Shareholders that they
approve this Agreement and CABF shall, acting through its Board of Directors,
(x) recommend that CABF Shareholders adopt this Agreement (the "CABF
Recommendation"), (y) include the CABF Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/



Prospectus and (z) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from CABF
Shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, including by
communicating to CABF Shareholders the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of CABF that they approve this Agreement, and by taking all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the affirmative vote or consent of
CABF Shareholders required by Applicable Law, except to the extent CABF's
Board of Directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined
below) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. CABF agrees that it has
an unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement to CABF Shareholders at the
CABF Shareholders' Meeting, including after any Adverse Recommendation Change.

(b) Neither CABF's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except
as expressly permitted by this Section 2.14(b), (x) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the CABF Recommendation or (y) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, CABF's Board of
Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of CABF may communicate the
basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change to the shareholders in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law, if and only if:

(i) CABF's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that it has received an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach
of Section 5.8) that is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not
been withdrawn;

(ii) CABF's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that a failure to accept such Superior Proposal
would be reasonably likely to result in CABF's Board of Directors breaching
its fiduciary duties to CABF and the CABF Shareholders under Applicable Law;

(iii) CABF's Board of Directors provides written notice (a "Notice of
Recommendation Change") to Parent of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and
its intent to withdraw the CABF Recommendation on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (and include
a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation) and identifying the Person
or Persons making such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five (5)
Business Day period referred to in this clause (iii) and in clauses (iv) and
(v) shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days following the giving of such
new Notice of Recommendation Change);

(iv) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, CABF shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent) and provide
Parent



reasonable opportunity during the subsequent five (5) (or three (3), as
applicable) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable CABF's Board of Directors to
proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that (A)
Parent shall not be required to propose any such adjustments, and (B) no
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made by CABF's Board of Directors nor
any committee thereof if Parent shall have offered to adjust, modify or amend
the terms of this Agreement to provide for substantially identical terms and
conditions as Superior Proposal; and

(v) CABF's Board of Directors, following such five (5) (or three (3), as
applicable) Business Day period, again determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate
their fiduciary duties to CABF and the CABF Shareholders under Applicable Law.

2.15 Closing Deliveries by CABF. At the Closing, CABF shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Parent:

(a) a certificate of the Secretary of CABF and Carolina Alliance Bank, dated

of CABF Exercisable Options granted pursuant to the CABF Stock Plans; and

necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



2.16 Closing Deliveries by Parent. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to CABF:

(a) a certificate of the Secretary of Parent and Park National, dated as of
the Closing Date, certifying to the: (i) resolutions of the Board of Directors
of Parent approving the Merger and the Bank Merger and the execution, delivery

2.17 Bank Merger. Subsequent to the Effective Time, Carolina Alliance Bank
("Carolina Alliance Bank"), a South Carolina state chartered bank and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of CABF, will merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into
The Park National Bank ("Park National"), a national banking association and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Park National shall be the surviving entity
in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Carolina Alliance Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the
Bank Merger shall become effective at a time after the Effective Time as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation. On the date
of this Agreement, Park National and Carolina Alliance Bank entered into the
agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Bank Merger
Agreement"). CABF shall cause Carolina Alliance Bank, and Parent shall cause
Park National, to execute such articles of merger, certificates of merger,
articles of combination, resolutions, and such other documents and
certificates as are necessary to cause the Bank Merger to become effective
(collectively, the "Bank Merger Certificates") following the Effective Time at
a time determined by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.17.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CABF

CABF hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Parent, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing (except to the extent made
only as of a specified date, in which case as of such date), except as set
forth in the written disclosure schedule delivered by CABF to Parent (the
"CABF Disclosure Schedule"). Such CABF Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this ARTICLE III, and the disclosures in any section
or subsection of the CABF Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other sections and
subsections in this ARTICLE III only to the extent it is readily apparent from
a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
sections and subsections.



3.1 Organization. CABF is a corporation duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the State of South Carolina, and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC
Act"). CABF has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. CABF is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CABF. True and complete copies of CABF's Charter Documents, as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by CABF to
Parent.

3.2 Authority; Binding Nature.

(a) CABF and Carolina Alliance Bank have all requisite power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, respectively, to
perform their respective obligations hereunder and under the Bank Merger
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Bank Merger Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by CABF
and Carolina Alliance Bank of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement,
respectively, and the consummation by CABF and Carolina Alliance Bank of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement,
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of CABF and
Carolina Alliance Bank. Subject to the CABF Shareholders' approval as
contemplated by Section 6.2(c), and the adoption and approval of the Bank
Merger Agreement by Carolina Alliance Bank and CABF as its sole shareholder,
no other corporate proceedings on the part of CABF or Carolina Alliance Bank
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Bank Merger
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by CABF and
constitutes (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) the
legal, valid and binding obligations of CABF enforceable against CABF in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the
appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). CABF, as
the sole shareholder of Carolina Alliance Bank, has approved, or shall
promptly hereafter approve, the Bank Merger Agreement, and the Bank Merger
Agreement has been, or promptly hereafter shall be, duly executed by Carolina
Alliance Bank.

(b) CABF and its Subsidiaries have taken all action required to be taken by
them in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby from the requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "affiliate transaction," "shareholder protection," "anti-greenmail,"
"business combination" or other antitakeover Laws of the State of South
Carolina to the extent such antitakeover Laws are applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. CABF and its Subsidiaries have
taken



all action required to be taken by it or its Subsidiaries in order to make
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby comply with, and the
transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of any
provisions of their respective Charter Documents concerning "business
combination," "fair price," "voting requirement," "constituency requirement"
or other related provisions.

3.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
CABF, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Bank Merger, do not and will not (a) conflict with, or result in a breach
or violation of or default under, any terms or conditions of the Charter
Documents of CABF or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) assuming that the consents
and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 hereof are duly obtained, (x)
conflict with or violate in any material respect any Applicable Law as to CABF
or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) result in any breach of, or constitute a
default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation pursuant to any Material Contract, or
by which any of their respective assets or properties may be bound, or (z)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the assets of CABF
or its Subsidiaries.

3.4 Consents and Approvals. Other than (i) the Regulatory Approvals, (ii) the
approval by CABF Shareholders of the Merger and the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and (iii) and such other filings,
authorizations, consents, notices or approvals as may be set forth on Schedule
3.4 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule, no consents, approvals, authorizations or
other actions by, or filings with or notifications to, any Person or any
Governmental Authority on the part of CABF or Carolina Alliance Bank is
required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by CABF of
this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including each of the Merger and the Bank Merger. CABF is unaware of any facts
or circumstances which might prevent CABF from obtaining or effecting any of
the authorizations, consents or approvals provided for in subsections (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this paragraph.

3.5 Regulatory Matters. CABF and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file since
January 1, 2015 with (i) the FDIC; (ii) the Federal Reserve; (iii) the SCBFI
and any predecessor agency; (iv) any other applicable bank regulatory agencies
and (v) any other applicable Governmental Authority and have paid all
applicable fees, premiums and assessments due and payable thereto. Each such
report, registration and statement, including financial statements, exhibits
and schedules thereto, complied, in all material respects, with Applicable
Law. Neither CABF nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-
desist or other formal or informal order or enforcement action issued by, or
is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement, operating agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter,
regulatory directive or similar undertaking with, or is subject to any capital
directive by, or since January 1, 2015, has been ordered to pay any civil
money penalty by, or since January 1, 2015, has been the recipient of any
supervisory letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request
of, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority of any kind (each, a
"CABF Regulatory Agreement"), nor has CABF or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised



since January 1, 2015 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority
that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such
CABF Regulatory Agreement. There is no material unresolved written violation,
criticism, comment or exception by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Authority relating to CABF or any of its Subsidiaries. No Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Authority has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to CABF's Knowledge, investigation into the business or operations of CABF or
any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2015, and there has been no formal or
informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Authority with respect to the business,
operations, policies or procedures of CABF or any of its Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2015, in each case, which would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CABF.
CABF is not aware of any reason why all required Regulatory Approvals would
not be received on a timely basis without undue delay and without the
imposition of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition as described in
the proviso to Section 5.2(a)(i).

3.6 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of CABF consists of (i) 20,000,000 common
shares, $1.00 par value per share, 7,245,348 of which are issued and

Stock Awards) and of which no shares are held in treasury, and (ii) 10,000,000
preferred shares, $1.00 par value per share, none of which are issued and
outstanding. The above common shares (the "Shares") constitute all of the

equity awards under CABF Stock Plans. CABF has furnished to Parent a true,
complete copy of any CABF Stock Plan, and Schedule 3.6(a) of the CABF
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
participants in any such CABF Stock Plan as of the date hereof and identifies
the number of Shares subject to CABF Stock Plans held by each participant
therein, the exercise price or prices of any CABF Equity Award, if applicable,
and the dates each CABF Equity Award was granted, becomes exercisable (if
applicable) and expires (if applicable). Except as disclosed in Schedule
3.6(a) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no
trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of CABF or any of its
Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding. CABF has not elected to defer interest
payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or related debentures

nonassessable and directly and wholly owned by CABF free and clear of any
Liens other than Permitted Liens.

(b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.6(b) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
there are no outstanding (i) rights, plans, options, warrants, calls,
conversion rights or any agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind
or character (either firm or conditional) obligating CABF or any of its
Affiliates to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be delivered or sold, any
capital stock of CABF, or any securities exchangeable for or



convertible into the capital stock of CABF, (ii) contractual obligations of
CABF or any of its Affiliates, or rights of a Person, to repurchase, redeem or

of first offer, rights of co-sale or tag-along rights, shareholder agreements
or other rights, understandings or arrangements regarding the voting or
disposition of the Shares. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
having the right to vote on any matters on which the holders of capital stock
may vote have been issued by CABF and are outstanding.

(c) No Subsidiary of CABF owns any capital stock of CABF.

3.7 Deposits. The deposit accounts of Carolina Alliance Bank are insured by
the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been duly,
timely and fully paid. All interest has been properly accrued on the deposit
accounts of Carolina Alliance Bank, and Carolina Alliance Bank's records
accurately reflect such accrual of interest. Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.7 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule, the deposit accounts of Carolina Alliance
Bank have been originated and administered in accordance with the terms of the
respective governing documents and in compliance with all Applicable Laws.
Neither CABF nor Carolina Alliance Bank has received written notice of any
loss or potential loss of any material business or customers related to the
deposit accounts of Carolina Alliance Bank. There is no action by the FDIC to
terminate Carolina Alliance Bank's deposit insurance and Carolina Alliance
Bank has not received any written claim or notice threatening action alleging
any of the foregoing.

3.8 Subsidiaries.

(a) Schedule 3.8(a) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each Subsidiary of CABF. Each Subsidiary of CABF (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CABF or any Subsidiary of CABF and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of CABF to pay dividends or distributions except for restrictions
imposed by Applicable Law and except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities.

(b) Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.8(b) of the CABF Disclosure
Schedule, there are no corporations, partnerships, limited liability
companies, associations or other entities in which CABF owns any equity or
other interest. All outstanding shares or ownership interests of CABF's
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable



and wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by CABF free and clear of any Liens
other than Permitted Liens.

3.9 Financial Information.

(a) Copies of (i) CABF's consolidated audited financial statements including

system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with its
management's general or specific authorizations and (ii) transactions are
recorded in conformity with GAAP and Applicable

notice or otherwise obtained actual knowledge of any material weakness
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures or methods of CABF
or any Subsidiary of CABF or their respective internal accounting controls.

(e) CABF and its Subsidiaries have (i) implemented and at all times maintained
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to CABF and its Subsidiaries is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of CABF by others within those
entities, and (ii) disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation prior to the
date of this Agreement, to CABF outside auditors and the audit committee of
CABF's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect CABF's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in CABF's internal controls over financial reporting.

3.10 Disclosure. No representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
and no statement contained in any certificate, list or other writing,
including but not necessarily limited to the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
furnished to Parent pursuant to the provisions hereof contains or will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements herein or therein, in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading.

Date through the Closing Date, except as reflected in the Interim Financial
Statements or as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
CABF and its Subsidiaries have operated only in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, and there has not been any Material
Adverse Change in CABF or its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.11 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule, there has been no action taken by CABF
or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from the Balance Sheet Date
through the date of this Agreement that would have required Parent's consent
if CABF had been subject to Section 5.1 at such time.

material liability or obligation (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice from the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (iii)
those liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) those liabilities and obligations,
if any, set forth in Schedule 3.12 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule.



3.13 Taxes.

Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and complete in all material respects
and were prepared in substantial compliance with all Applicable Laws; (ii) all

for information related to Tax matters; or (iii) notice of deficiency or
proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed by
any taxing authority against CABF or any of its Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.13(b)
of the CABF Disclosure Schedule lists all Tax Returns filed by CABF and its
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2015, and
indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited. Parent has received

been provided access to correct and complete copies of all such Tax Returns,
filed by CABF for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2015, and
have received all examination reports and statements of deficiencies related
to federal and state income Tax assessed against or agreed to by CABF with
respect to those taxable periods.

(c) There are no material Liens on CABF's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets
that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax
other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or which the validity
thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which adequate accruals or reserves have been established in accordance with

limitations in respect of income Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with

provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law) as a transferee, successor, by
contract or otherwise. Any Tax allocation or sharing agreement that is listed
on Schedule 3.13(f) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule will be terminated as of
the day of the Effective Time and will have no further effect for any taxable

Closing Date, CABF and its Subsidiaries shall have no further liability or
claim under such Tax allocation or sharing agreements.

(g) Except as listed on Schedule 3.13(g) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,

any "reportable transaction" as that term is defined in Section 6707A(c) of
the Code.

(n) No gain recognition agreements have been entered into by either CABF or
any Subsidiary of CABF, and, except as listed on Schedule 3.13(n) of the CABF

Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve
as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance
with the past custom and practice of CABF and each Subsidiary of CABF in

of the Closing,



CABF or one of its Subsidiaries will have good and marketable title or a valid
leasehold interest in, easement or right to use all of its assets and
properties, including those reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet as being
owned or leased, as applicable (except for assets sold or otherwise disposed
of or leases that have expired since the Interim Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business), and none of such properties or assets is subject
to any Liens other than Permitted Liens. All such properties and assets are in
good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear expected, and, in
all material respects, are fit for the uses to which they are being put.

(b) Schedule 3.14(b) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all real property owned by CABF or one of its
Subsidiaries other than "real estate owned" ("OREO") acquired as a result of
debts previously contracted or exercising remedies under loans held by CABF or
one of its Subsidiaries and which are not used for the operations of CABF
(together with any buildings, structures, fixtures or other improvements
thereon, the "Owned Real Property"). CABF or one of its Subsidiaries has, and
as of the Closing will have, good, marketable and insurable fee simple title
interest in and to all Owned Real Property.

(c) Schedule 3.14(c) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all leases pursuant to which CABF or one of its
Subsidiaries is a lessee or lessor (the "Leases") of any real property
(together with any buildings, structures, fixtures or other improvements
thereon, the "Leased Property" and, together with the Owned Real Property, the
"Real Property"). All such Leases are valid, legally binding, in full force
and effect, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general equitable
principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity. Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.14(c) of
the CABF Disclosure Schedule, there is not under any of the Leases: (i) any
default by CABF or its Subsidiaries or any circumstance which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default; or (ii) to CABF's
Knowledge, any default or claim of default against any lessor to or lessee of
CABF or its Subsidiaries, or any event of default or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by any such lessor or
lessee. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
result in a breach or default under any of the Leases, and, except as set
forth on Schedule 3.14(c) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule and specifically
identified as such, no consent of or notice to any third party is required as
a consequence thereof. CABF has made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the Leases, and no Lease has been modified in any respect
since the date it was made available. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(c)
of the CABF Disclosure Schedule, none of the property subject to a Lease is
subject to any sublease, license or other agreement granting to any person any
right to the use, occupancy or enjoyment of such property or any portion
thereof. Neither CABF nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
that the landlord with respect to any real property lease would refuse to
renew such lease upon expiration of the period thereof upon substantially the
same terms, except for rent increases consistent with past experience or
market rentals. There are no pending



or, to CABF's Knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings with respect to
the Owned Real Property.

3.15 Litigation; Orders.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(a) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
there is no Proceeding pending or, to CABF's Knowledge, threatened either (i)

right of any of them may be subject, or (ii) seeking to prevent, materially
alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(b) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
there is no Order either (i) outstanding against CABF or any of its

subject, or (ii) seeking to prevent, materially alter or delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) To CABF's Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve as a basis for the
commencement of any material Proceeding against CABF or any of its
Subsidiaries.

3.16 Compliance.

(a) CABF and each of its Subsidiaries are, and at all times have been, in
compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws and Orders,
including, but not limited to, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, the
Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in
Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any regulations promulgated by
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the Interagency Policy Statement
on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing
Act of 2008, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, and
any other law relating to bank secrecy, discriminatory lending, financing or
leasing practices, money laundering prevention, Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act and all agency requirements relating to the origination,
sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans.

(b) CABF and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since
January 1, 2015 held, all licenses, franchises, Permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, Permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CABF, and, to CABF's Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any such
necessary license, franchise, Permit or authorization is threatened.



(c) Neither CABF nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or in
violation of any term or provision of (i) its Charter Documents, (ii) Material
Contract or (iii) any material Permit which it holds.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.16(d) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
CABF has implemented one or more formal codes addressing each of ethics,
personal trading policies, conflicts of interest policies, customer privacy
policies, anti-money laundering policies, fair lending policies, vendor risk
management policies, policies related to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 and other material policies as may be required by any
Applicable Law for itself and its Subsidiaries, and a complete and correct
copy of each such policy has been made available to Parent. Such policies
comply in all material respects with the requirements of any Laws applicable
thereto.

3.17 Loans.

(a) Each loan, revolving credit facility, letter of credit or other extension
of credit (including guarantees) or commitment to extend credit originated or
acquired by CABF and its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Loans") (i) complies in
all material respects with all Applicable Laws, (ii) has been made, entered
into or acquired by CABF or one of its Subsidiaries in accordance with
customary Board of Directors-approved loan policies, (iii) is evidenced by
promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness, which are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, and which, together with all security agreements
and guarantees, constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, and as applicable, CABF or one of its Subsidiaries and
are enforceable in accordance with their terms, (iv) is in full force and
effect, and (v) to CABF's Knowledge, is not subject to any offset, recoupment,
adjustment or any other valid or cognizable claim or defense by the applicable
borrower; provided that the enforcement of each of (iii) and (v) above may be
limited by the appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general
equitable principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity. None of the rights or remedies under the
documentation relating to the Loans has been amended, modified, waived,
subordinated or otherwise altered by CABF or its Subsidiaries, except as
evidenced by a written instrument which is a part of the file with respect to
such Loans made available to Parent and was entered into by CABF or a
Subsidiary in good faith and in its ordinary course of business. For purposes
of this Section 3.17(a), the phrase "enforceable in accordance with its terms"
as it relates to a Loan does not mean that the borrower has the financial
ability to repay a Loan or that any collateral is sufficient to result in
payment of the Loan secured thereby.

(b) CABF and its Subsidiaries have previously disclosed a complete and correct
list of all Loans that, as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date (i) are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (ii) are on nonaccrual status or (iii) are classified as "Watch
List," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," (or words of
similar import) together with the principal amount on each such Loan and the



identity of the obligor thereunder. Schedule 3.17(b) of the CABF Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete list of other real estate owned, acquired by
foreclosure or by deed in-lieu thereof and owned by CABF or its Subsidiaries
as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date, including the book value thereof. True,
correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending policies and
practices of CABF and each of its Subsidiaries have been made available to
Parent.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17(c) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale or previously sold to
investors) has been solicited and originated and is administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant files are being maintained, in
accordance with the relevant loan documents in all material respects, CABF's
underwriting and servicing standards (and, in the case of Loans held for
resale or previously sold to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of
the applicable investors) and with all Applicable Laws and applicable
requirements of any government-sponsored enterprise program. CABF and its
Subsidiaries have properly fulfilled in all material respects their
contractual responsibilities and duties with respect to any Loan in which they
act as the lead lender or servicer and have complied in all material respects
with their duties as required under applicable regulatory requirements.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17(d) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule,
none of the agreements pursuant to which CABF or any of its Subsidiaries has
sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein, other
than repurchase obligations arising upon breach of representations and
warranties, covenants and other obligations of CABF or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

(e) CABF has made available to Parent true and correct copies of the loan
files related to the Loans. Such files contain, in all material respects, all
of the documents and instruments relating to such Loans.

(f) All payments made on the Loans have been properly credited to the
respective Loan.

(g) As to each Loan that is secured, whether in whole or in part, by a
guaranty of the United States Small Business Administration or any other
Governmental Authority, such guaranty is in full force and effect, and will
remain in full force and effect following the Closing Date, in each case,
without any further action by CABF or its Subsidiaries' subject to CABF
fulfilling its obligations under the Small Business Administration Agreement
that arise after the date hereof.

(h) Schedule 3.17(h) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
Loans by CABF and its Subsidiaries to any directors, executive officers and
principal shareholders (as such terms are defined in Regulation O of the
Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of CABF or any of its Subsidiaries as of
August 31, 2018. There are no Loans to any employee, officer, director or
other Affiliate of CABF on which the borrower is paying a rate other than that
reflected in the note or the relevant credit agreement. All such Loans



are and were made in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws. Each Loan disclosed on Schedule 3.17(h) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule
has been made in the ordinary course of business, and on the same terms,
including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable arms'-length transactions, did not involve more than the normal
risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

3.18 Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowances for loan and lease losses and
for credit losses contained in the Financial Statements and the allowance for
loan and lease losses and for credit losses shown on any financial statements
delivered in accordance with Section 5.14, as the case may be, were and will
be established in accordance with the practices and experiences of CABF and
its Subsidiaries and were and will be in accordance with the requirements of
GAAP.

and marketable title to all securities held by it, except securities sold
under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity, free
and clear of any Lien, except as set forth in the Financial Statements and
except to the extent any such securities are pledged in the ordinary course of
business consistent with prudent banking practices to secure obligations of
CABF or its Subsidiaries.

3.20 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Schedule 3.20 of the CABF
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of July 31, 2018, any interest rate swaps,
caps, floors, derivative, hedge, foreign exchange or currency purchase or sale
agreements, option agreements, futures and forward contracts or other similar
derivative transactions and risk management arrangements or agreements to
which CABF or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. All instruments, agreements
and arrangements set forth on Schedule 3.20 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule
were entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of
any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of CABF
or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms, and are
in full force and effect. CABF and each of its Subsidiaries have duly
performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and,
to CABF's Knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

3.21 Intellectual Property. Schedule 3.21 of the CABF Disclosure Schedule sets

except as such enforceability may be limited by the appointment of a
conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent

3.32 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by CABF for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
is first mailed to the CABF Shareholders or at the time of CABF Shareholders'
Meeting, (b) the Registration Statement, when filed with the SEC and when it

under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by CABF with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the

of FIG Partners, LLC, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as
of such date and based upon



and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the CABF
Shareholders.

3.34 Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information. CABF is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no reason
to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it or any
of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued
with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in satisfactory
compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy and customer
information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and
regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the
provisions of the information security program adopted by CABF or Carolina
Alliance Bank pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. CABF is not aware of any facts
or circumstances that would cause it to believe that any non-public customer
information or information technology networks controlled by and material to
the operation of the business of CABF and its Subsidiaries has been disclosed
to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any material remedial action. The
Board of Directors of CABF (or, where appropriate, the Board of Directors of
any of CABF's Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in
all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder, and it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

3.35 CRA Compliance. Carolina Alliance Bank is "well capitalized" (as that
term is defined at 12 C.F.R. 325.103) and its most recent examination rating
under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, as amended ("CRA"), was
"satisfactory" or better. To CABF's Knowledge, there is no fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely
to cause Carolina Alliance Bank to receive any notice of non-compliance with
such provisions of the CRA or cause Carolina Alliance Bank's CRA rating to
decrease below the "satisfactory" level.

3.36 Mortgage Banking Business. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect:

(a) CABF and its Subsidiaries have complied with, and all documentation in

Subsidiaries for poor performance, poor loan quality or concern with respect
to CABF's or its Subsidiaries' compliance with laws.

cancellation pursuant to any material contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K)) to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or

to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Since January 1, 2015,
each such report, registration and statement, including financial statements,
exhibits and schedules thereto, complied, in all material respects, with

criticism, comment or exception by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Authority with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations

Effect upon the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent is not

therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of

forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required
to be filed with the SEC by it under



Section 5 of the Securities Act or Sections 13(a), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, from and after January 1, 2015 (collectively, the
"Parent SEC Filings"). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented if
applicable, (A) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date
of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and (B) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

4.12 Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including any notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings, as amended,
supplemented or restated, if applicable, was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of
unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each
of such consolidated financial statements, as amended, supplemented or
restated, if applicable, presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent, at their dates and the results of
operations and changes in shareholders' equity of Parent for the periods
indicated, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby.

4.13 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
is first mailed to the CABF Shareholders or at the time of CABF Shareholders'
Meeting, (b) the Registration Statement, when filed with the SEC and when it
or any amendment thereto becomes effective under the Securities Act, or (c)
the documents and financial statements of Parent incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent with respect to information supplied by CABF for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. The
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement will, when filed by
Parent in final form with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

4.14 Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information. Parent is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in
any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including,



without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by Parent and Park National pursuant to
12 C.F.R. Part 364. It is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
cause it to believe that any non-public customer information has been
disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would
cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any material remedial action.
The Board of Directors of Parent (or, where appropriate, the Board of
Directors of any of its Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in
all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder, and it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

4.15 CRA Compliance. Park National is "well capitalized" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 6.4) and its most recent examination rating under the CRA
was "satisfactory" or better. To Parent's Knowledge, there is no fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely
to cause Park National to receive any notice of non-compliance with such
provisions of the CRA or cause Park National's CRA rating to decrease below
the "satisfactory" level.

4.16 Tax Representations. As of the date of this Agreement it is the present
intention, and as of the date of the Effective Time it will be the present
intention, of Parent to continue, either through Parent or through a member of
Parent's "qualified group" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368‑1(d)(4)), at least one significant historic business line of CABF, or to
use at least a significant portion of CABF's historic business assets in a
business, in each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368‑1(d). As of the date of this Agreement and the date of the Effective
Time, neither Parent nor any "related person" (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Parent has any plan or intention to
redeem or reacquire, either directly or indirectly, any of the Parent Common
Stock issued to the CABF Shareholders in connection with the Merger. As of the
date of this Agreement and the date of the Effective Time, Parent does own and
will own all of the outstanding stock or other equity interests in Park
National. As of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of the Effective
Time, Parent has no and will have no plan or intention to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the assets of CABF acquired in the Merger, except for
dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers described in
Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or described and permitted in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(k).

4.17 Ordinary Course; Lack of Material Adverse Change. From the Balance Sheet
Date through the Closing Date, except as reflected in Parent SEC filings or
set forth in Schedule 4.17 of the Park Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent has operated only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and there has not been any Material Adverse
Change in Parent.



4.18 Material Contracts. Parent is not a party to or bound by any contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) that is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not
been filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings filed prior
to the date hereof.

4.19 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties made by Parent in this ARTICLE IV, neither Parent nor any other
person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent or its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and
Parent hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties.

subject to any cease-and-desist order or other order, formal or informal
enforcement action or directive issued by, or written agreement, consent
agreement, operating agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter
or similar undertaking with, or any request to adopt any board resolutions by,
any Governmental Authority, in each case resulting from or arising out of the
conduct of CABF's business or that in any manner relates to CABF, or (B)
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger, measured on a scale relative to CABF and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by any
Regulatory Agency or Government Authority that the Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated herein or in a substantially similar manner
immediately following the Effective Time or that any CABF Regulatory Agreement
will not terminate and be of no further force and effect as of and following
the consummation of the Merger (any of the foregoing matters in clauses (A)
and (B), a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition"); (ii) obtaining all
necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or
exemptions from nongovernmental Persons; and (iii) executing and delivering
any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, Parent and CABF shall each prepare and file
any applications,



notices and filings required in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals.
Parent and CABF shall each use reasonable best efforts to obtain each such
approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of any
information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required
to obtain the Regulatory Approvals). Each party will provide the other with
copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to
filing, other than material filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. If any Governmental Authority shall require the modification
of any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement as a condition to
granting the Regulatory Approvals, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a mutually agreeable
adjustment to the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby.

(c) The parties shall advise each other within twenty-four hours of receiving
any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Regulatory Approvals or any other consent or approval required hereunder
will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.

5.3 Access; Integration of Data Processing; Confidentiality.

(a) In order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the integration of the business and operations of CABF, subject to
Section 5.3(c) and Applicable Laws relating to confidentiality and the
exchange of information, CABF shall permit Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries
and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
Representatives, access, throughout the period before the Closing Date, at
Parent's sole expense, (i) during customary business hours, to CABF's and CABF
Subsidiaries' books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities in which Parent may have a reasonable
interest; provided, however, that CABF shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would result in the waiver by it of the privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel or where such
access or disclosure would contravene any Applicable Law or Order or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, further,
that the parties shall attempt to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, and (ii) during and, as reasonably required, outside of
customary business hours, to telecommunications and electronic data processing
systems, facilities and personnel of CABF and its Subsidiaries for the purpose
of performing conversion activities related to data processing integration.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference
with CABF's regular business operations during any such access to CABF's
property, books and records.

(b) At the request of Parent, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, CABF and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause
their officers and employees to, make all reasonable efforts to cause their
respective telecommunications and data processing service providers to,
cooperate and assist Parent in connection with preparation



for an electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable data regarding
CABF and its Subsidiaries to Parent's and Parent's Subsidiaries' systems of
telecommunications and electronic data processing, including, if requested by
Parent, by granting to Parent one or more powers of attorney authorizing
Parent to instruct or otherwise contact such telecommunications and data
processing service providers on CABF's behalf. Electronic and systematic
conversion shall occur at such time as determined by Parent, in its sole
discretion, provided, however, that no such conversion shall occur prior to
the Closing. Parent shall be responsible for reasonable and agreed upon costs
incurred by CABF, including all fees to third parties, in connection with any
such efforts.

(c) Each of Parent and CABF acknowledges and agrees that the Non-Disclosure
Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition, covenants and
agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the Non-
Disclosure Agreement, information provided to them pursuant to this Agreement.
If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing Date,
the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the provisions of this Section 5.3(c) shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

5.4 Notification. CABF, on the one side, and Parent, on the other side, shall
promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after becoming aware of
any such breach) notify the other party or parties in writing (a) if it
believes that such party or parties have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (b) if it
believes that any event shall have occurred that might reasonably be expected
to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 if continuing on the Closing Date.

5.5 Public Announcements. CABF and Parent shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not issue, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to issue,
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
written consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement or filing as may be required by Applicable Law or Order, or
any listing agreement with a national stock exchange or automated quotation
system; provided, further, however that such party shall have first used
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party with respect to such
release, statement or filing.

5.6 No Control of CABF. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of CABF
prior to the Closing Date.

5.7 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide to each employee of CABF or
its Subsidiaries who, as decided by Parent in its sole discretion, shall
continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (a "Continuing Employee") (i) base wages or
salaries, as applicable, and (ii) employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements (excluding, however, all equity plans) that are



substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the Employee Benefit Plans of
CABF provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date (but in no event greater than the base wages, salaries or
employee benefits provided to Parent's similarly situated employees).

(b) CABF shall ensure that as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, each
employee or other service provider of CABF and its Affiliates who provides
services to the business of CABF is employed by, or providing services to,
CABF or its Subsidiaries and that no other individual is employed by CABF.
CABF shall deliver an updated copy of the employee census described in Section
3.25(d) to Parent not more than ten (10) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement and shall provide Parent with an updated copy of such employee
census within ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Only current
and former employees of CABF and its Subsidiaries (and their dependents) shall
be participants in the Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by CABF.

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to provide, each employee of CABF or its
Subsidiaries who, as decided by Parent in its sole discretion, does not
continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (a "Discontinued Employee")
with severance benefits under the severance policy of Carolina Alliance Bank
as described on Schedule 5.7(c) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule or pursuant to
the terms of any employment agreement with CABF or its Subsidiaries in
existence as of the date hereof; provided, that such benefit payments shall be
conditioned on execution of a release of claims in a form satisfactory to
Parent.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent or Parent's Affiliates
in which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after
the Closing Date (a "Parent Plan"), Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive all preexisting conditions, actively at work
requirements, exclusion and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements under any such Parent Plan to the extent they were
inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, any Employee Benefit Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated prior to the Closing Date; and (ii)
ensure that each Continuing Employee receives full credit (including
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits, but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit Parent Plan
or any such credit that would result in a duplication of benefits) under each
Parent Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes or may become a
participant for service with the Surviving Corporation (or any predecessor to
the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), solely to the extent such
service was credited under the Employee Benefit Plans. As of the Closing Date,
Parent shall credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that
such employees had accrued under any vacation policy or arrangement listed on
Schedule 3.24(a) of the CABF Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing Date. With
respect to each Parent Plan that is a health plan in which Continuing
Employees participate after Closing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such health
plan with respect to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs ("Closing
Date Plan Year") for amounts (such as deductibles and co-payments) paid under
any similar Employee Benefit Plan by such Continuing Employee,



with respect to the Closing Date Plan Year and for which verification is
provided by the insurer or third party administrator of such Employee Benefit
Plan, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of any applicable Parent Plan.

(e) Parent and CABF acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.7 are included for the sole benefit of Parent and CABF and
nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment to any
Employee Benefit Plan or Parent Plan or the creation of any new employee
benefit plan, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any
other person, including any employee or former employee of any of Parent or
CABF or their respective Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof
or (iii) otherwise obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to maintain any
particular Parent Plan or other employee benefit plan or retain the employment
of any particular employee following the Closing Date. Parent and CABF further
acknowledge and agree that CABF and its Subsidiaries shall provide to Parent
all employee books and records relating to Continuing Employees no later than
the Closing Date.

(f) CABF shall terminate the 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of CABF, on terms acceptable
to Parent, and simultaneously amend the 401(k) Plan to the extent necessary to
comply with all Applicable Laws to the extent not previously amended. Said
termination shall provide that all participants in the 401(k) Plan shall be
fully vested in their account balances thereunder; and CABF shall notify the
401(k) Plan participants and beneficiaries of such termination prior to the
Closing Date pursuant to Applicable Law requirements. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to make distributions and otherwise wind-up the 401(k) Plan.

5.8 No Solicitation of Transaction.

(a) Subject to Section 5.8(b), from the date hereof until the Closing Date,
or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with ARTICLE VII, CABF shall not, and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, agents, advisors or other Representatives to not,
directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or
assistance) any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than Parent) any non-public information or data with respect to CABF or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Merger), or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, arrangement,
understanding, contract or agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Upon
execution of this Agreement, CABF shall, and shall cause all of its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents, advisors and other
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.8 shall preclude
CABF or its Representatives from contacting any such party or parties solely



for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the first clause of this
sentence or to enforce the provisions of any confidentiality agreement entered
into with any Person with respect to a potential Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, CABF
may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of Section 5.8(a) if, but
only if, (i) CABF has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal, prior to the CABF Shareholders' Meeting, that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.8; (ii) CABF's Board of Directors determines (in
accordance with this Agreement) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; (iii) CABF has provided Parent with prompt notice of such
determination, which notice shall be prior to taking any such action; (iv)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any non-public information or data
with respect to CABF or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, CABF receives from such Person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to CABF than those contained in the
Non-Disclosure Agreement (or, if such confidentiality agreement includes
provisions that are less favorable in the aggregate to CABF, than those
contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement, CABF offers to amend the Non-
Disclosure Agreement to include such similar provisions); and (v) CABF
determines in good faith, after consultation with CABF's outside legal counsel
that the failure of CABF to furnish such information or access or enter into
negotiations or discussions would reasonably be expected to violate its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. CABF shall promptly provide to Parent
any non-public information regarding CABF or its Subsidiaries provided to any
other Person that was not previously provided to Parent, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

(c) CABF shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers or
proposals) are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, CABF
or any CABF Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating
such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information
request and the material terms and conditions of any such proposals, offers or
information requests (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related
documentation or correspondence).

5.9 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or any time
prior to the Effective Time was, a director, officer or employee of CABF or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnitees") in respect of all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) in connection with any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out of the
fact that Indemnitee was an officer, director or employee of CABF or any
Subsidiary or acts or omissions by Indemnitee in such capacity or taken at the
request of CABF or any Subsidiary, at or any



time prior to the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby),
to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume all obligations of CABF
and its Subsidiaries to Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in CABF's Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of CABF's Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance any expenses (including legal expenses) of any Indemnitee under this
Section 5.9 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay advances if it shall be determined that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by CABF
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so long as
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current annual
premiums paid by CABF for such insurance and, in the event the cost of such
coverage shall exceed that amount, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase as
much coverage as possible for such amount. The provisions of this Section 5.9
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies with the
same terms, conditions and coverage as indicated above have been obtained by
the Surviving Corporation for purposes of this Section 5.9 from carriers with
the same or better rating as the carrier of such insurances as of the date of
this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
Representatives and is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any Indemnitee may have under
CABF Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. In the event the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the purchaser of its assets and
properties shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. This
Section 5.9 shall survive the Effective Time.

5.10 Efforts to Consummate; Further Assurances.

(a) Parent and CABF agree to use reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause
to be satisfied as soon as practicable their respective obligations hereunder
and the conditions precedent to the Closing.



(b) Prior to the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall promptly
advise the other party of any change or event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein.

(c) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of CABF, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

5.11 Title Commitments. CABF shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of
this Agreement, cause a national title insurance company licensed to do
business in the State of South Carolina to provide Parent with commitments for
an A.L.T.A. owner's policy of title insurance insuring fee simple title to the
Owned Real Property that will be vested in the name of Parent as of the
Closing Date, together with copies of instruments referred to therein as
exceptions.

5.12 CABF Divisional Advisory Board. At or promptly following the Effective
Time, Parent and Park National shall create a CABF Divisional Advisory Board
which shall act as an advisory board to Park National. Parent and Park
National shall take all action necessary to appoint to such advisory board
certain of those persons who served on the Board of Directors of CABF
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, as mutually agreed upon
by Parent and CABF. No later than thirty (30) days after the execution of this
Agreement, CABF shall provide to Parent the names of its current directors who
desire to serve on the CABF Divisional Advisory Board pursuant to this Section
5.12. Members of the CABF Divisional Advisory Board will receive compensation
that is commensurate Park National's historic advisory board compensation
practice.

5.13 Employment Agreements. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, CABF agrees to cause each person listed on Schedule 5.13 of
the Park Disclosure Schedule to execute and deliver an employment agreement in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, effective upon the Closing.

5.14 Financial Statements. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VII, CABF will
provide to Parent as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the
twentieth (20th) day following the end of the relevant calendar month, the
monthly unaudited financial statements of CABF as provided to CABF's
management (including any related notes and schedules thereto), for each of
the calendar months ended after the date of this Agreement.

5.15 Tax Matters.

(a) For federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A), and this
Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a "plan of



reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368.3(a). After the date of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, after the Effective Time), subject to the other terms and
conditions in this Agreement, each party hereto shall cooperate and take any
action that is required to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any
actions or cause any actions to be taken that could reasonably be likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. All parties hereto shall report the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code.

(b) The Chief Financial Officer of each of the Parent and CABF shall execute
and deliver to Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP and Nelson Mullins Riley and
Scarborough LLP certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the
parties and such firms at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by
such firm, including at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with each firm's delivery of its Tax
opinion pursuant to Section 6.2(g) and Section 6.3(d). Each of Parent and CABF
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be
taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not
to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the
certifications and representations included in the certificates described in
this Section 5.15(b).

5.16 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, file
all documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to (a) list, prior to the Effective Time if such
listing is required to be made prior to the Effective Time under the NYSE
American listing rules, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as part
of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, or (b) make such
post-Closing filings with the NYSE American as may be required by the
applicable rules thereof.

5.17 Litigation and Claims. CABF shall promptly, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days, notify Parent in writing of any Proceeding, or of any
claim, controversy or contingent liability that might reasonably be expected
to become the subject of a Proceeding, against CABF or any of its
Subsidiaries, if such Proceeding or potential Proceeding is reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Change in CABF. CABF shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to CABF's Knowledge,
threatened against CABF or any of its Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent
or its Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby. CABF shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate at their own expense in the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against CABF and/or its directors or
Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed without Parent's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a
suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision, provided,
that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every
other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be in

Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or



unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.
