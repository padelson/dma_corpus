waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (b) such other date
to which Parent and the Partnership may agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to as the " ** _Closing Date_**." The Closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will take place at the

77002, at 10:00 a.m. Houston time on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****_Merger Consideration_**. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership, Partnership GP, or
any holder of Parent securities or Partnership Common Units:

 



 

(a) All of the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into
the sole limited partner interest in the Partnership.

 



 

(b) The general partner interest in the Partnership issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding in the
Surviving Entity in the form set forth in the Existing Partnership Agreement,
and Partnership GP, as the holder of such general partner interest, will
continue as the sole general partner of the Surviving Entity as set forth in
the Existing Partnership Agreement. At the Effective Time, the books and
records of the Partnership will be revised to reflect that all limited
partners of the Partnership immediately prior to the Effective Time cease to
be limited partners of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and that Parent is the sole limited partner of the Partnership, and the
Partnership will continue without dissolution.

 



 

(c) Each Partnership Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Units) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.185 Parent Common Units (the " ** _Merger Consideration_**
," and such ratio, the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** "), which Parent Common Units
will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Parent Agreement, as applicable (such Parent Common
Units described in this clause (c) are referred to herein as the " ** _New
Common Units_** _,_ " and the issuance of the New Common Units as part of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement is referred to herein as the "
** _New Common Unit Issuance_** ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, each Partnership Common Unit (if any) owned immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Partnership or its wholly owned Subsidiaries or
by Parent or its wholly owned Subsidiaries (collectively, the " ** _Excluded
Units_** ") will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and no
consideration will be received therefor.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, except as noted within the last sentence of this
_Section 3.1(e)_, any award of Partnership Common Units (including
performance units based upon Partnership Common Units) issued under the
Partnership LTIP (" ** _Partnership Restricted Units_** ") and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into new awards of
restricted units based upon Parent Units (" ** _Parent Restricted Units_** ").
With respect to any Partnership Restricted Unit that is a performance unit
prior to the Effective Time, the performance period shall end and be
calculated by the Partnership immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms of the individual performance unit award agreements
that govern such awards, and the target number of performance units for each
holder shall be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the individual
performance unit award

 



      
 

 



 

agreements that govern such awards immediately prior to the conversion of that
adjusted Partnership Restricted Unit to a Parent Restricted Unit; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnerships calculation of the performance actually
attained on the "Change in Control Date" (as defined in the applicable award
agreements) for the shortened performance period shall be subject to the
Parents good faith review of such calculations on or as soon as practicable
following the Closing. Each award of Partnership Restricted Units being
converted into an award of Parent Restricted Units shall be converted with the
number of Parent Restricted Units subject to each such converted award to be
equal to the result of (i) the number of Partnership Restricted Units subject
to such award multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole Parent Restricted Unit. Each Parent Restricted Unit shall
represent a right to receive a Parent Common Unit on the date the restrictions
applicable to the Parent Restricted Unit lapses. The agreements between the
Partnership GP and each such award holder regarding the Partnership Restricted
Units shall be assumed by Parent or an Affiliate thereof, and such awards, as
converted by Parent pursuant to this _Section 3.1(e)_ into Parent Restricted
Units, shall continue to be governed, on and after the Effective Time, by the
terms and conditions of such agreements (subject to the adjustments required
by this _Section 3.1(e)_ after giving effect to the Merger) and by the
Partnership LTIP as adopted by Parent pursuant to _Section 3.5_ and shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions, including, but not
limited to, vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vesting of the
Partnership Restricted Units that any Employee who is either not an Offered
Employee or is an Offered Employee that received an Unqualified Offer and
determined not to accept such an Unqualified Offer or any member of the
Partnership Board holds at the Effective Time shall be accelerated by the
Partnership in accordance with the terms of the Partnership LTIP and the
applicable award agreements as if the Employees or Partnership Board members
service relationship was terminated without "Cause" or by an "Involuntary
Termination," as applicable, on or following a "Change of Control" (each term
as defined in the applicable award agreements) and such Partnership Restricted
Units shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ on the terms applicable to issued and
outstanding Partnership Common Units. If an Employee is an Offered Employee
that received a Qualified Offer and determined not to accept such a Qualified
Offer, the Employees Partnership Restricted Units will be forfeited pursuant
to his award agreements as if he had voluntarily resigned immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

 **3.2** ** ****_Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers_**. All Partnership
Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ will cease to be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a result
of and pursuant to the Merger. At the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate representing Partnership Common Units (a " ** _Certificate_** ")
and each holder of non-certificated Partnership Common Units represented by
book-entry (" ** _Book-Entry Units_** ") will cease to be a limited partner of
the Partnership and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive (a) the Merger Consideration, and the right to be admitted as
an Additional Member of Parent in connection therewith, (b) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional New Common Unit in accordance with _Section
3.3(d)_, and (c) any distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_, in
each case, to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor
in accordance with _Section 3.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of
(i) ** ** any holder of the Partnership Restricted Units will be as set forth
in _Section 3.5_, and (ii) ** ** any holder of Excluded Units will be as set
forth in _Section 3.1(d)_. In addition, holders as of the relevant record
date of Partnership Common Units immediately prior to the Effective Time will
have continued rights to

 



      
 

 



 

any distribution, without interest, with respect to such units with a record
date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Common Units in accordance
with the terms of the Existing Partnership Agreement and this Agreement and
which remains unpaid as of the Effective Time. Such distributions by the
Partnership are not part of the Merger Consideration, and will be paid on the
payment date set therefor to such holders of Partnership Common Units
regardless of whether they exchange their Partnership Common Units pursuant to
_Section 3.3_. At the Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the
Partnership will be closed immediately and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the unit transfer books of the Partnership with
respect to Partnership Common Units.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****_Exchange of Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Partnership
Common Units for the Merger Consideration as required by this _Article III_
(the " ** _Exchange Agent_** "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Common Units, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_, through the Exchange Agent,
New Common Units and cash as required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to make
payments in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_, in each case without interest. Any cash (including as payment for any
fractional New Common Units in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ and any
distributions with respect to such fractional New Common Units in accordance
with _Section 3.3(c)_) and New Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent
are hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Exchange Fund_**." The Exchange Agent
will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for Partnership Common Units pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Sections
3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other
purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership
Common Units as of the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded Units)
(i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of certificated
Partnership Common Units, delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) (the " **
_Letter of Transmittal_** "), and (ii) instructions (in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common Units
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable. Promptly
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in
respect of Book-Entry Units) as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions, each holder who held Partnership Common Units immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (x) holders of the Partnership Restricted
Units and (y) holders of Excluded Units) will be entitled

 



      
 

 



 

to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units therefor (A)
New Common Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New
Common Units that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_ (after taking into account all Partnership Common Units then
held by such holder), and (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional New Common
Units pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ and distributions pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, any
cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Units, or any Parent
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Partnership Common Units that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Partnership, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Partnership Common Units may be paid to a transferee, if the
Certificate representing such Partnership Common Units or evidence of
ownership of the Book-Entry Units is presented to the Exchange Agent, and in
the case of both certificated and Book-Entry Units, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and the
Person requesting such exchange will pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the record holder of such
Partnership Common Units, or will establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until such
required documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been
surrendered, as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit representing a Partnership Common Unit (other than an Excluded
Unit) will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such delivery and surrender the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Partnership Common Units, and (without the necessity of
such surrender) any cash or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Common Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Units with a
Deemed Record Date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
Partnership Common Units with respect to New Common Units that such holder
would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional New Common Units will be paid to any such holder until such
holder has delivered the required documentation and surrendered any
Certificates or Book-Entry Units as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.
Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of
_Section 3.3(b)_, there will be paid to such holder of New Common Units
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New
Common Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_
(which shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount
of distributions with a Deemed Record Date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to New Common Units and payable with respect to
such New Common Units, and (ii) promptly after such compliance, or, if later,
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a Deemed
Record Date after the Effective Time, but prior to such delivery and surrender
and a payment date subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such
New Common Units (which shall be paid by Parent).

 



 

(d) _Fractional New Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of New Common
Units representing fractional New Common Units or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_, and such fractional interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
New Common Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Partnership Common Units converted in the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a New Common Unit (after taking
into account all Partnership Common Units exchanged by such holder) will
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price
as of the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New Common Unit that such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.
As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Further Rights in Partnership Common Units_. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a Partnership Common Unit in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_) and any declared distributions to be paid on Partnership Common Units
as described in _Section 3.3(c)_ will be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Partnership Common Unit.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Common Units after 180
days following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by
Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership
Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Partnership Common Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common
Units to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, or any
distributions with respect to New Common Units to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_, in each case **,** without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Partnership Common
Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be held by Parent. Without limitation of the
foregoing, after 180 days following the Effective Time any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Partnership Common Units will become the property of
Parent, subject to the legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled
thereto under abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such amount
reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common Units represented by
such Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and any cash payable in lieu of
fractional New Common Units to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.3(d)_

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership Common Units such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent
reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment; _provided, however_ , that Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, will provide reasonable notice to the applicable holders of
Partnership Common Units prior to deducting and withholding any amounts
pursuant to this _Section 3.3(h)_. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Partnership Common Units in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.
The Parties agree that the Partnership intends to deliver to Parent a valid
certificate of non-foreign status pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b) such that no withholding will be required pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code.

 



 

(i) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Common Units as Additional
Members of Parent_. All New Common Units to be issued in the Merger will be
issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon the issuance of
New Common Units to the holders of Partnership Common Units in accordance with
this _Section 3.3_ and the execution and delivery by such holder of a
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, Parent and the Parent Board will
be deemed to have automatically consented to the admission of such holder as a
member of Parent in respect of its New Common Units, such holder shall be
automatically admitted as a member of Parent and such admission will be
reflected on the books and records of Parent.

 



 

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the Exchange Fund (other than the New Common Units) as directed by
Parent on a daily basis, in Parents sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon affects the amounts payable or the
timing of the amounts payable to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to the
other provisions of this _Section 3.3_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid promptly to Parent.

 



 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. The Partnership and
Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby the Partnership will be
the terminating partnership and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a
result, the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution, as described
in Section 721 of the Code, of all of the assets of the Partnership to Parent
in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the
maximum extent possible, any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Units and other cash deemed received in exchange for the assets shall be
treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). To the extent any cash received in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and other cash deemed received in
exchange for the assets exceeds the amount that can be so treated, such excess
cash will be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction described in
Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " ** _Disguised Sale_** "). Each of the
Partnership and Parent agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax
Returns in accordance with the foregoing and shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit,
litigation or other

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

 



 

 **3.4** ** ****_Anti-Dilution Provisions_**. Without limiting the covenants
in _Sections 4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Partnership
Common Units or Parent Common Units shall have been changed into a different
number of units or a different class after the date of this Agreement by
reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, unit distributions,
combinations or exchanges of Partnership Common Units or Parent Common Units,
the Exchange Ratio will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders
of Partnership Common Units and Partnership Restricted Units the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

 **3.5** ** ****_Treatment of the Partnership LTIP_**. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent Board shall adopt the Partnership LTIP, authorize the
conversion of Partnership Restricted Units into Parent Restricted Units in
accordance with _Section 3.1(e)_ at the Effective Time, and shall take such
other actions as may be necessary to authorize the events contemplated in
_Section 3.1(e)_; such actions shall include the following: (a) effective as
of the Effective Time, the Partnership LTIP shall be continued by Parent and
all Partnership obligations thereunder assumed by Parent (including
obligations with respect to Parent Restricted Units in accordance with
_Section 3.1(e)_) and such plan shall continue in effect subject to
amendment, termination, and/or suspension in accordance with the terms of the
Partnership LTIP, notwithstanding the Merger; (b) from and after the Effective
Time all references to Partnership Common Units in the Partnership LTIP shall
be substituted with references to Parent Common Units; (c) the number of
Parent Common Units that will be available for grant and delivery under the
Partnership LTIP from and after the Effective Time shall equal (i) the number
of Partnership Common Units that were available for grant and delivery under
the Partnership LTIP immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio; (d) from and after the Effective Time, awards under
the Partnership LTIP may be granted only to those individuals who were
eligible to receive awards under the Partnership LTIP immediately before the
Effective Time (including any individuals hired on and after the Effective
Time who would have been eligible for such awards pursuant to the eligibility
provisions of the Partnership LTIP as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time); and (e) no participant in the Partnership LTIP shall have any
right to acquire Partnership Common Units under the Partnership LTIP from and
after the Effective Time. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of Parent
Common Units equal to the number of Parent Common Units that will be available
for grant and delivery under the Partnership LTIP, as calculated pursuant to
_Section 3.5(c)_, from and after the Effective Time. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a Form S-8 registration
statement (or such other appropriate form), or a post-effective amendment to a
registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Units available for grant and delivery under
the adopted Partnership LTIP from and after the Effective Time and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein) for so long as such shares are available for grant and
delivery under the plan. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
the Partnership shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8
registration statement originally filed by the Partnership with respect to the
Partnership LTIP deregistering all shares of Partnership Common Units
thereunder.

Except as set forth in (a) all forms, registration statements, reports,
schedules and statements filed or furnished by the Partnership with the SEC
under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2014 and prior
to the date of this Agreement, and in each case including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein
(collectively, the " ** _Partnership SEC Documents_** ") (but excluding any
disclosure contained in any such Partnership SEC Documents under the heading
"Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or
similar heading (other than any historical factual information contained
within such headings, disclosure or statements)), or (b) the Partnership
Disclosure Schedule prior to the execution of this Agreement (provided that
(i) disclosure in any section of such Partnership Disclosure Schedule is
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the Partnership
Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to such other section
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto, and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Partnership Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty is not deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Partnership (a " ** _Partnership Material Adverse Effect_** ")), the
Partnership Entities represent and warrant to Parent as follows:

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****_Organization, General Authority and Standing_**. Each
Partnership Entity is a limited partnership validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite limited
partnership power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. Section 5.1 of the
Partnership Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries. Each of the Partnerships Subsidiaries (a) is a
limited partnership, corporation or limited liability company, as the case may
be, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of organization, (b) has all requisite limited partnership, corporate or
limited liability company, as applicable, power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and (c) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
in good standing to do business as a foreign limited partnership, corporation
or limited liability company, as the case may be, in each jurisdiction in
which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding
or operating of its properties makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****_Capitalization_**.

 



 

(a) As of the close of business on May 18, 2015, there are 152,986,718
Partnership Common Units issued and outstanding (including 3,423,262
Partnership Restricted Units), and all such Partnership Common Units and
limited partner interests represented thereby were duly authorized, are
validly issued in accordance with the Existing Partnership Agreement and,
except as expressly provided in the Existing Partnership Agreement, are not
subject to any preemptive or similar rights (and were not issued in violation
of any preemptive or similar rights). Partnership GP is the sole general
partner of the Partnership, owning all of the outstanding general partner
interests in the Partnership, and such general partner interests were duly
authorized and validly issued in accordance with the Existing Partnership
Agreement and are solely non-economic interests.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth above in this
_Section 5.2_, (i) there are no partnership interests, limited liability
company interests or other equity securities of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries issued or authorized and reserved for issuance, (ii) except as
set forth in the Existing Partnership Agreement, there are no outstanding
options, warrants, preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities, agreements or commitments of
any character obligating the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
transfer or sell any partnership or other equity interest of the Partnership
or such Subsidiary or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
partnership interests or equity interests, or any commitment to authorize,
issue or sell the same or any such equity securities, except pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) there are no contractual obligations of the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
partnership interest or other equity interest in the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such securities or agreements listed in clause (ii) of
this sentence.

 



 

(c) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other Indebtedness, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the Partnership Unitholders on any
matter.

 



 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting or registration of capital stock or other equity interest of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **5.3** ** ****_Equity Interests in Other Entities_**. Other than the ETP
Units and ownership of interests in its Subsidiaries as set forth in Section
5.1 of the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Partnership does not own
beneficially, directly or indirectly, any equity securities or similar
interests of any person, or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of
any kind. The Partnership owns such interests in its Subsidiaries free and
clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

 **5.4** ** ****_Power, Authority and Approvals of Transactions_**. Each
Partnership Entity has the requisite limited partnership power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and,
subject to the Partnership Unitholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the Partnership Unitholder

 



      
 

 



 

Approval, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been
authorized by all necessary limited partnership action by each Partnership
Entity. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
Partnership Entity and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Other Parties thereto, constitutes each Partnership Entitys valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against each Partnership Entity in accordance
with its terms (except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar Law
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
equitable principles).

 



 

 **5.5** ** ****_No Violations or Defaults_**. Subject to required filings
under federal and state securities laws and with the NASDAQ, assuming the
other consents and approvals contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and _Article
VIII_ are duly obtained and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals
specified in _Section 7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by each Partnership Entity do not and will not (a)
constitute a breach or violation of, or result in a default (or an event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or result
in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or
accelerate the performance required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, franchise, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture
or other instrument or obligation to which any Partnership Entity or any of
its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Partnership Entity or
any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound except for such
breaches, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations
that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect, (b) constitute a
breach or violation of, or a default under the Existing Partnership Agreement,
the Partnership Certificate of Limited Partnership, the Partnership GP
Agreement or the certificate of limited partnership of Partnership GP, (c)
materially contravene or conflict with or constitute a material violation of
any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to any Partnership Entity
or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation of any material Lien
on any of the assets of the Partnership Entities or any of their respective
Subsidiaries assets.

 



 

 **5.6** ** ****_Consents and Approvals_**. No consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in
connection with (a) the execution and delivery by each Partnership Entity of
this Agreement or (b) the consummation by any Partnership Entity of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing with
the SEC of a joint proxy statement (the " ** _Proxy Statement_** ") relating
to the matters to be submitted to the Partnership Unitholders at a meeting of
such holders for the purpose of approving this Agreement and the Merger
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " ** _Partnership
Meeting_** ") and relating to the matters to be submitted to the Parent
Unitholders at a meeting of such holders for the purpose, among other things,
of approving the New Common Unit Issuance (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " ** _Parent Meeting_** ") and other filings
required under federal or state securities laws, (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
(iii) any consents, authorizations, approvals, filings or exemptions in
connection with compliance with the rules of the NASDAQ, (iv) such filings and
approvals as may be required to be made or obtained under the Antitrust Laws,
and (v) such other consents, authorizations, approvals, filings or
registrations the absence or unavailability of which would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

 **5.7** ** ****_Financial Reports and the Partnership SEC Documents_**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2014, the Partnership has filed or furnished with the SEC
all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required
to be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed
Partnership SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as
of the date of such amendment), each Partnership SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be and did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents (the " ** _Partnership Financial Statements_** ") as
of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment) (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, for
normal year-end adjustments (that are not individually or in the aggregate
material) and the absence of footnotes, in each case, to the extent permitted
by applicable SEC regulations)), and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not
individually or in the aggregate material).

 



 

 **5.8** ** ****_Internal Controls and Procedures_**. The Partnership has
established and maintains internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15
and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Partnership, including its Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Partnerships principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Partnerships principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to the Partnerships auditors and the audit committee of the
Partnership Board (a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls that could adversely affect the Partnerships ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Partnerships auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and
(b) any fraud, regardless of whether material, that involves management or
other employees who have a

 



      
 

 



 

significant role in the Partnerships internal controls. The principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Partnership have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the Partnership SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

 



 

 **5.9** ** ****_Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_**. Except as disclosed in
the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the
Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014,
the unaudited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the
Partnerships Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March
31, 2015 (the " ** _Balance Sheet Date_** "), and in the financial statements
(or notes thereto) included in subsequent Partnership SEC Documents filed by
the Partnership prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the Partnership
nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date or has
incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (a) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the
financial statements of the Partnership included in the Partnership SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or reflected in the notes
thereto, (ii) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices, or (iii) relate to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the proposal of
Parent with respect to the Merger or (b) liabilities, obligations or
contingencies that (i) would not reasonably be expected, either individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.10** ** ****_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_**.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
Partnership has carried on and operated its business in all material respects
in the ordinary course of business and (ii) none of the Partnership nor any
Subsidiary of the Partnership has undertaken any action that would be
prohibited by _clauses (d)_, _(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ , _(l)_ , _(o)_ ,
_(p)_ or (to the extent related to any of the foregoing clauses) (r) of
_Section 4.1_ if such provisions were in effect at all times since the
Balance Sheet Date.

 



 

 **5.11** ** ****_Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_**.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section
5.18_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 5.13_),
each of the Partnership and Partnership GP is in compliance with all, and is
not in default under or in violation of any applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Partnership nor Partnership GP has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement from a

 



       
 

 



 

Governmental Authority that alleges that the Partnership is not in compliance
with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law, except where such
non-compliance, default or violation would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate their
properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " **
_Partnership Permits_** "), except where the failure to be in possession of
such Partnership Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All
Partnership Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to
be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Partnership Permits is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Partnership, threatened, except where such suspension or
cancellation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.12** ** ****_Material Contracts_**.

similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity; and provided that any indemnity, contribution
and exoneration provisions contained in any such Partnership Material
Agreement may be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the
Partnership Material Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Partnership or Partnership GP and constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto and (ii) is in full force and
effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each case unless the failure to be
so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, under any Partnership
Material Agreement, any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would

 



      
 

 



 

constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice
of termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case, except
such events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to which
requisite waivers or consents have been obtained or which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Partnership
Material Adverse Effect.

Partnership Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

violation of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as
a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or
any Environmental Permit that remains pending or unresolved;

 



 

(d) There are no actions, suits, proceedings (including civil, criminal,
administrative and dispute resolution proceedings), claims, causes of action,
government investigations, orders, decrees or judgments pending or in effect,
or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, threatened by a Governmental
Authority or other third party against the Partnership or its Subsidiaries
that allege a violation of or liability under any Environmental Law that
remain pending or unresolved, and, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, there
are no existing facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to

materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such

Subsidiaries or to which the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is
otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, a threatened party,
except for Proceedings that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

 **5.17** ** ****_Information Supplied_**. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Article
VI_, none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, or (b) the Proxy Statement (which will be

respects in accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the applicable
provisions of all Laws applicable to such Partnership Employee Benefit Plan,

there are no Liens arising from or relating to any Partnership Employee
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on Section 5.19(f) of the Partnership Disclosure
Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, no Partnership Employee Benefit
Plan or any other arrangement maintained by the Partnership or its
Subsidiaries provides any of the following retiree or post-employment benefits
to any Person: medical, disability (other than disability benefits relating to

applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers compensation,
except where the failure to comply would not, individually or in the

Effect. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership,
threatened material investigations, audits, complaints or proceedings against
the Partnership by or before any Governmental Authority involving any
applicant for employment, any current or former employee or any class of the

Property_** ") free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Encumbrances,
except where the failure to own or have the right to use such Intellectual
Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

and, subject to the Parent Unitholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the Parent Unitholder Approval, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary
limited liability company action by Parent and by Merger Sub. The Parent Board

 **6.5** ** ****_No Violations or Defaults_**. Subject to required filings
under federal and state securities laws and with the NASDAQ, assuming the
other consents and approvals contemplated by _Section 6.6_ and _Article
VIII_ are duly obtained and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals
specified in _Section 7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by Parent do not and will not (a) constitute a breach or
violation of, or result in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under, or result in the termination
or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
franchise, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which

creation of any material Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries assets.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.6** ** ****_Consents and Approvals_**. No consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in
connection with (a) the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement or (b) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing with

filings or registrations the absence or unavailability of which would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger.

 



 

 **6.7** ** ****_Financial Reports and Parent SEC Documents_**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2014, Parent has filed or furnished with the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed Parent
SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date
of such amendment), each Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
as the case may be and did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the " ** _Parent Financial Statements_** ") as of their respective
dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) (i) complied as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of unaudited statements, for normal year-end adjustments (that
are not individually or in the aggregate material) and the absence of
footnotes, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable SEC
regulations), and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, material).

 



 

 **6.8** ** ****_Internal Controls and Procedures_**. Parent has established
and maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (b) any fraud, regardless of
whether material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were
complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

 



 

 **6.9** ** ****_Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_**. Except as disclosed in
the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, the unaudited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the Parents Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended on the Balance Sheet Date,
and in the financial statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent
Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries had at the Balance
Sheet Date or has incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (a)
liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (i) are accrued or reserved
against in the financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or reflected in the notes
thereto, (ii) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices or (iii) relate to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the proposal of
Parent with respect to the Merger or (b) liabilities, obligations or
contingencies that (i) would not reasonably be expected, either individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) have
been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.10** ** ****_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_**.

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) Parent and
its Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business and (ii) none of
Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has undertaken any action that would be
prohibited by _clauses (d)_, _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(k)_ , _(l)_ ,
_(m)_ , _(n)_ or (to the extent related to

 



      
 

 



 

any of the foregoing clauses) _(o)_ of _Section 4.2_ if such provisions were
in effect at all times since the Balance Sheet Date.

 



 

 **6.11** ** ****_Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_**.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section
6.18_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 6.13_),
each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all, and is not in
default under or in violation of any applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any
applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate their properties and
to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are being conducted as of the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Parent Permits_** "), except
where the failure to be in possession of such Parent Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent
Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where
such suspension or cancellation would not individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.12** ** ****_Material Contracts_**. (a) Section 6.12 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule contains a listing of the following contracts to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in effect on the date of this
Agreement (each contract that is described in this _Section 6.12_ being a "

(i) each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC);

equity interests, as the case may be;

 



 

(vii) each collective bargaining agreement to which the Partnership is a party
or is subject; and

 



 

(viii) each agreement under which Parent has advanced or loaned any amount of
money to any of its officers, directors, employees or consultants, in each

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity; and provided that any indemnity, contribution
and exoneration provisions contained in any such Parent Material Agreement may
be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the Parent Material
Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto and
(ii) is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each
case unless the failure to be so would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of Parent, under any Parent Material
Agreement, any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any
notice of termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case,
except such events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to
which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained or which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.13** ** ****_Environmental Matters_**. Except as reflected in the Parent
Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries and its assets, real properties and
operations are in compliance with all Environmental Laws and Environmental
Permits;

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries have received any written notice from
any Governmental Authority alleging, with respect to any such entity or any of
their respective assets, real properties (whether owned or leased or formerly
owned or leased) or operations, the

 



      
 

 



 

violation of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as
a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or
any Environmental Permit that remains pending or unresolved;

 



 

(c) There are no actions, suits, proceedings (including civil, criminal,
administrative and dispute resolution proceedings), claims, causes of action,
government investigations, orders, decrees or judgments pending or in effect,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by a Governmental Authority or
other third party against Parent or its Subsidiaries that allege a violation
of or liability under any Environmental Law that remain pending or unresolved,
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no existing facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit,
proceeding, claim, cause of action, investigation, order, decree or judgment
that remain pending or unresolved;

 



 

(d) There has been no Release of any Hazardous Material by Parent or its
Subsidiaries in violation of Environmental Law at, on, under or from any real
properties as a result of the operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries that

adequately reserved for in the Parent Financial Statements; and

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.13_ constitutes the sole and exclusive representation and
warranty of Parent with respect to Environmental Permits, Hazardous Materials
and Environmental Law.

 



 

 **6.14** ** ****_Reserve Report_**. The factual, non-interpretive data
relating to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent on which the reserve report
prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, referred to in Parents Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the " ** _Parent
Reserve Report_** ") was based was accurate in all material respects at the
time such data was provided to DeGolyer and MacNaughton. With respect to the
proved reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report, the Parent Reserve
Report conforms in all material respects to the guidelines with respect
thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon
commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.15** ** ****_Title to Properties_**. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
good and indefeasible title to all real and personal properties that are
material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and
clear of all Liens and defects and imperfections of title except (a) such as
do not materially affect the value of such property and do not materially
interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by Parent
and its Subsidiaries, (b) for Permitted Encumbrances and (c) such as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.16** ** ****_Litigation_**. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a threatened
party, except for Proceedings that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

 **6.17** ** ****_Information Supplied_**. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Partnership set forth in _Article V_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in (a) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (b) the Proxy Statement (which will be
included as a prospectus in the Registration Statement) will, on the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to Partnership Unitholders or Parent
Unitholders, and at the time of the Partnership Unitholders Meeting and Parent
Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with
respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Partnership for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the foregoing documents.

purposes, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code, and has been properly treated
as such since its formation; and

 



 

(k) each Subsidiary of Parent other than VNR Finance Corp. is currently (and
has been since its respective formation) either (i) properly classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) properly disregarded
as an entity separate from its respective owner for U.S. federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b).

 



 

 **6.19** ** ****_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) Section 6.19(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of each material Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates during the six-year

(c) Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
all Laws

 



       
 

 



 

applicable to such Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and complies with such terms
and such Laws, in each case except where the failure to be so administered or
to so comply, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no investigations
by any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other claims (except
routine claims for benefits payable under the Parent Employee Benefit Plans)
or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
involving any Parent Employee Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to, or

for a volume submitter plan and, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has
occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Employee Benefit Plan conforms with or is exempt from Section 409A of the

the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under
Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no fiduciary (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Parent Employee Benefit Plan subject to Part 4
of Title I of ERISA has committed a breach of fiduciary duty that could
subject the Partnership to material liability taken as a whole. Each Parent
Employee Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material liability to
Parent or the Partnership (other than ordinary administration expenses and
payment of accrued benefits).

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on Section 6.19(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
no payments (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and related
regulations) have or will be made under a Parent Employee Benefit Plan in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that,

sanctions imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, and there are no
Liens arising from or relating to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on Section 6.19(f) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,

disability (other than disability benefits relating to a disability occurring
during relevant employment) or life insurance benefits, except as required by
(i) the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state law or (ii)
company-paid or subsidized healthcare coverage pursuant to an employment,
severance or similar agreement, plan or arrangement. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, each of Parent and each of its ERISA Affiliates is in
compliance with (A) the requirements of the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder and any similar state Law and (B) the
applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the proposed

(g) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance in all
respects with all applicable Law relating to the employment of labor,
including all such applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective
bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers
compensation, except where the failure to comply would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened
material investigations, audits, complaints or proceedings against the Parent
or its Subsidiaries by or before any Governmental Authority involving any
applicant for employment, any current or former employee or any class of the
foregoing that would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) None of Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party to, or subject to, a

individuals employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates, and no organizational

each case within the past six years. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened, labor disputes, strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages,
requests for representation, pickets or work slow-downs, nor has such event or
labor difficulty occurred within the past three years.

 



 

 **6.20** ** ****_Intellectual Property_**. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or
have the right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of
the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
(collectively, the " ** _Parent Intellectual Property_** ") free and clear of
all Liens except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to own
or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, the use of the Parent Intellectual
Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the operation of Parents business

 **ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS**

 



 

The Partnership Entities hereby covenant to and agree with the Parent
Entities, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant to and agree with the
Partnership Entities, that:

 



 

 **7.1** ** ****_Consummation of the Merger_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
7.1(c)_), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and each of the
Partnership Entities, on the other hand, will cooperate with the other and use
(and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including preparing and filing
promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, (ii) obtain promptly (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents, clearances,

consummate the Merger, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other
Parties of (and supply to the Other Parties) any communication received by

 



      
 

 



 

such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger (iii)
permit the Other Parties to review in advance and incorporate their reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any investigations or reviews under any Antitrust
Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult
with the Other Parties in advance of any meeting, written communications or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_ , the Parties will take
reasonable best efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege. Any Party may share information with any
Other Party on an "outside counsel only" basis. Nothing in this _Section 7.1_
shall obligate the Parties to share any information regarding the value of the
transaction or, absent the entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense
agreement, information covered by the attorney client privilege, work product
doctrine or other similar privilege.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its
Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve any
objections that a Governmental Authority or any other Person may assert under
any Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, in each
case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in
any event no later than the Outside Date (including any extension thereof
provided for in this Agreement or agreed to in writing by the Parties);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.1_ shall require, or be construed to
require, any Party to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise), divest itself of or limit the
ownership of all or any portion of their respective businesses, assets or
operations.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 7.1_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Partnership will use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.

 



 

 **7.2** ** ****_Registration Statement; Proxy Statement._**

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Partnership will jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
and the Partnership and Parent will jointly prepare and Parent will file with
the SEC the Registration

 



      
 

 



 

Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of the Partnership and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing and keep the Registration Statement effective
for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and
the Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Parent Unitholders and Partnership
Unitholders, respectively, as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent,
and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be
made by either Parent or the Partnership without providing the Other Parties a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Partnership or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by
the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the
Other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the Parent Unitholders and the Partnership
Unitholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or for additional information and will supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating
to the Registration Statement.

 



 

(b) The Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and, subject to _Section
7.3_, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration Statement
being declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold, the Partnership Meeting. If reasonably practicable, the Partnership
Meeting shall be held within 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement.
Subject to _Section 7.3_, the Partnership GP will, through the Partnership
Board, (i) determine that the Merger is in the best interests of the
Partnership and the Partnership Unitholders and (ii) recommend that the
Partnership Unitholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " ** _Partnership Board
Recommendation_** "). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to _Section 7.3_)
include the Partnership Board Recommendation. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, the Partnerships obligations to
call, give notice of and hold the Partnership Meeting in accordance with this
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal
or Alternative Proposal, or by any Partnership Change in Recommendation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership agrees that:
(i) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
IX_ (including, if applicable, upon payment of the Termination Fee), the
Partnership shall

 



      
 

 



 

not submit any Superior Proposal to a vote of the Partnership Unitholders; and
(ii) the Partnership shall not (without Parents prior written consent)
adjourn, postpone or, subject to termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article IX,_ cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or resolve to
adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or adjourn the
Partnership Meeting without Parents prior written consent up to the Business
Day prior to the Outside Date (A) in the absence of proxies sufficient to
obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder Approval, (B) in the absence
of a quorum or (C) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Partnership Unitholders prior to Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a Partnership Change in
Recommendation and this Agreement is not terminated in accordance with
_Article IX_, the Partnership shall remain required to call, hold and convene
the Partnership Meeting unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) Parent will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Parent Meeting. Parent will,
through the Parent Board, recommend to the Parent Unitholders approval of the
New Common Unit Issuance (the " ** _Parent Board Recommendation_** "). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not (without the
Partnerships prior consent) adjourn, postpone, subject to the termination of
the Agreement in accordance with Article IX, cancel (or propose, publicly or
otherwise, or resolve to postpone or cancel) the Parent Meeting. The Proxy
Statement shall include the Parent Board Recommendation. Parent shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable (including soliciting proxies or postponing or
adjourning the Parent Meeting up to the Business Day prior to the Outside
Date) for the purposes of (i) obtaining a quorum at the Parent Meeting and
(ii) obtaining the Parent Unitholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent
Meeting without the Partnerships prior written consent (i) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Parent Unitholder Approval up
to the Business Day prior to the Outside Date, (ii) in the absence of a quorum
or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
Parent Unitholders prior to Parent Meeting.

 



 

(d) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent
Meeting and the Partnership Unitholder Meeting on the same day at the same
time.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****_Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_**.

 



 

(a) The Partnership will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, and employees to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any

 



      
 

 



 

discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_ , the
Partnership will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers and employees not to, and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to
lead to the submission of any Alternative Proposal, or (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any non-public information with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (1)
the Partnership has received a written Alternative Proposal that was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement and that the Partnership Board
believes is _bona fide_ , and that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section 7.3_ and (2) the Partnership Board, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be likely to lead to
or result in a Superior Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to clauses
(x), (y) and (z) below, (A) furnish information, including non-public
information, with respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x)
substantially concurrently with furnishing any such non-public information to,
or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the
Partnership gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and the
Partnerships intention to furnish non-public information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, (y) the Partnership receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement between the Partnership
and such Person with confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive
to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Parent and (z) the Partnership will provide to Parent any non-public
information about the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
with providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

 



 

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal (and
any changes thereto) and the material terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Proposal, including the identity of such Person making such
Alternative Proposal, and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
proposals or draft agreements received by the Partnership or any
Representative of the Partnership setting forth the terms and conditions of,
or otherwise relating to, such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership will keep
Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to any such
Alternative Proposal, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership shall
promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide Parent
with copies of any additional written proposals received by the Partnership or
that the Partnership has delivered to any third party making an Alternative
Proposal relating to such Alternative Proposal) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. The Partnership Entities agree that neither
Partnership Entity nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Partnership will enter
into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits the Partnership from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership Board
shall not: (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent
the Partnership Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Partnership
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) publicly approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Proposal (any action described in this _Section 7.3(c)(i)_ being referred to
as a " ** _Partnership Change in Recommendation_** "); (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into (other than a
confidentiality agreement under _Section 7.3(a)(y))_, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing
for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal; (iii)
fail to announce publicly within ten Business Days after a tender offer or
exchange offer relating to the Partnership Units shall have been commenced
that the Partnership Board recommends rejection of such tender offer or
exchange offer and reaffirming the Partnership Board Recommendation; or (iv)
resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit the Partnership or any
Representative of the Partnership to agree or publicly propose to take any of
the actions referred to in this _Section 7.3(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
a public statement that describes the Partnerships receipt of an Alternative
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be
deemed a Partnership Change in Recommendation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Partnership receives a written
Alternative Proposal (and such proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership
Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 7.3_ and (iii) the Partnership Board
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then
the Partnership Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, terminate this Agreement and pay Parent a Termination Fee
or effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership Board may not take such action pursuant to the foregoing
unless:

 



 

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
any current draft of any proposed definitive agreement providing for the
Alternative Proposal for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into
and any other relevant proposed transaction agreements) at least two Business
Days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a
Partnership Change in Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than two Business Days prior to
the Partnership Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days,
the " ** _Notice Period_** ") (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)(i)_ and a new Notice Period); and

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions
to or adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Partnership Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, to
make a Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event, but only if (i) prior to taking any such action, the Partnership Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with and considering the advice
of the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware law, the
Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP Agreement, (ii) the
Partnership has given at least three Business Days advance written notice to
Parent that the Partnership Board intends to take such action (which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action) and (iii)
during such period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to or
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent.
If after compliance with the foregoing clauses (i)  (iii) the Partnership
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Partnership Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware
law, the Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP Agreement, then
the Partnership Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation. An " **
_Intervening Event_** " means a material event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence, development or change that did not exist or was not known to the
Partnership Board on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences
of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Partnership Board as
of the date of this Agreement), which event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence, development or change, or any material consequences thereof,
becomes known to the Partnership Board prior to the receipt of the Partnership
Unitholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall the
receipt, existence, potential for or terms of an Alternative Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event
and (B) if the Intervening Event relates to a change, event, development,
circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect involving the Partnership, then
none of the following changes, events, developments, circumstances,
conditions, occurrences or effects shall constitute an Intervening Event: (1)
changes in the general economic, financial, credit or securities markets,
including prevailing interest rates or currency rates, or regulatory or
political conditions; and changes in oil, natural gas, condensate or natural
gas liquids prices or prices of other commodities, including changes in price
differentials; (2) changes in general economic conditions in the (v) oil and
gas exploration and production industry, (w) natural gas gathering,
compressing, treating, processing and transportation industry generally, (x)
the natural gas liquids fractionating and transportation industry generally,
(y) the crude oil and condensate logistics and marketing industry generally,
and (z) the natural gas marketing and trading industry generally; (3) the
announcement or pendency of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, performance of obligations under this Agreement); and (4) changes in
any Laws or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the industries in
which the Partnership or Parent operate or applicable accounting regulations
or the interpretations thereof.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders. Any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication by the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership or the Partnership Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Partnership Unitholders) will not be considered a failure
to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to
Parent of, all or a portion of the Partnership Board Recommendation.

 



 

(g) The Partnership acknowledges and agrees that any action inconsistent with
any provision set forth in this _Section 7.3_ that is taken by a
Representative of the Partnership that, if taken by the Partnership would have
been a material breach of this _Section 7.3_, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of such provision by the Partnership.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " ** _Alternative Proposal_** " means any proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) ** ** direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of assets of the Partnership equal to 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Partnership or to which 20% or more of the
Partnerships revenues or earnings are attributable, (B) ** ** direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the Partnerships equity securities, (C)
** ** tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning 20% or more of the Partnerships equity securities or (D)
** ** merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Partnership that is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the Partnerships consolidated assets
or equity interests; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " ** _Superior Proposal_** " means a written offer that was not solicited
after the date of this Agreement and that was obtained after the date of this
Agreement, (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, (1) more than 50% of the
outstanding equity securities of the Partnership or (2) more than 50% of the
assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, or (B) related to a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transactions involving the Partnership, in
each case made by a third party, which did not result from a material breach
of this _Section 7.3_, is on terms and conditions that the Partnership Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, to be more favorable to the Partnership Unitholders
than the Merger, taking into account at the time of determination (a) relevant
financial considerations, (b) the identity of the person making such offer,
(c) the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of the
transactions contemplated by such offer, (d) the other terms and conditions of
such offer and the implications thereof on the Partnership, including relevant
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and (e) any changes to the
terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent
in writing.

 



       
 

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (and, with
respect to books and records, the right to copy) to all of its and its
Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. Each Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Parties (i) a
copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of
any communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party from
the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as the Other Parties may reasonably request (including information
necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Partnership shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Parent (1) on a monthly basis reports specifying the capital
expenditures, operating expenses, production and completed and in-progress
activities of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, together with a comparison
to the relevant items in the Partnerships 2015 budget, and (2) weekly
operating reports, in each case, to the extent as prepared by the Partnership
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each
Party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the Other
Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall not require any Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Other Parties
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of clause (i) the Parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would
not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract or Law or
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the Other Parties shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Party being requested to
disclose the information shall (x) notify the Other Parties that such
disclosures are

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the Other Parties in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first
proviso in this _Section 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where such disclosures
are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under
any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable third party to any such contract with respect to the disclosures
prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the
terms of such contract).

 



 

 **7.5** ** ****_Public Statements_**. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Partnership. Parent and the
Partnership will not, and each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives
not to, issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the
prior written approval of the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party
or its Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public
disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such
Partys or its Parent entitys capital stock is traded, provided such Party
uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Parties an opportunity to
first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable
comment regarding same; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 7.5_
shall not be deemed to restrict in any manner the Partnerships ability to
communicate with its employees and that the Partnership shall not be required
by this _Section 7.5_ to consult with any Other Party with respect to a
public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.3_.

 



 

 **7.6** ** ****_Confidentiality_**. The obligations of Parent and the
Partnership under the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and all information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation
Material" as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict
the performance by the Partnership or Parent of their respective obligations
under this Agreement, and in the case of any conflict between the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement the terms of
this Agreement shall control.

 



 

 **7.7** ** ****_Takeover Laws_**. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each
of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure
the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **7.8** ** ****_New Common Units Listed_**. Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NASDAQ Global Select

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as
practicable. Each of Parent and the Partnership has the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party
or any Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party hereto agrees
that it will consult with the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of
all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the
Other Parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Partnership agrees, upon request, to furnish the
Other Parties with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may reasonably
be necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such Other Parties or any of such Other Partys Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(c) This _Section 7.9_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws
or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

 



 

 **7.10** ** ****_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement, the
Supplemental Indemnification Agreements, this Agreement or, if applicable,
similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Entity, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective
Time, an officer, director or employee of Partnership GP LLC, Partnership GP,
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such
Person, in such Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(regardless of whether such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the
Partnership) serving at the request of or on behalf of Partnership GP LLC,
Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and together with
such Persons heirs, executors or administrators (collectively, the " **
_Indemnified Parties_** ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law in connection with any Claim or Action and any

 



      
 

 



 

losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within 15 days after any request for advancement, advance to
each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the final disposition of
such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any
bond or other security. The indemnification and advancement obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ extend to
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim or
Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue
as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of
Partnership GP LLC, Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries
after the date of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such persons
heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this
_Section 7.10_: (x) the term " ** _Claim_** " means any threatened, asserted,
pending or completed action or proceeding, whether instituted by any Party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other person, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any action or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism ("
** _Action_** "), arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, employee,
member, trustee or other fiduciary of the Partnership GP LLC, Partnership GP,
the Partnership or of any of its Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a
similar capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y)
the term " ** _Indemnification Expenses_** " means documented out of pocket
attorneys fees and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out of
pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification
is sought pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_, including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party;
and (z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the DLLCA that
authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or
the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DRULPA
and the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may
indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves,
_provided that_ any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or the DLLCA
that adversely affects any right of any

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity will settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened
Claim or Action in respect of which indemnification has been or could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding
of wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing
Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of Partnership GP LLC, Partnership GP or the Partnerships
Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements (including the Supplemental
Indemnification Agreements) of Partnership GP LLC, Partnership GP, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Entity
and Parent in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Existing
Partnership Agreement and the organizational documents of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Existing
Partnership Agreement and Supplemental Indemnification Agreements, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then
only to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided, however_ , that any
such modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate
any such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
modification; and _provided further_ that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any Claim made within such period
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such Claim.

 



 

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
full effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may
substitute therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or
lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or before the
Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " ** _Maximum Amount_** ") and will purchase the maximum amount
of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this _Section 7.10(d)_ would cost in excess of that amount. If Parent elects,
then Parent may, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy"
with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been
committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_
that in no event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the
Partnership, exceed six times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy"
is purchased, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any further
obligations under this _Section 7.10(d)_.

 



 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(g) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



 

 **7.11** ** ****_Notification of Certain Matters_**. The Partnership shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Partnership, to the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to the Partnership or Parent, (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries and that relate to the Merger, and (c) any material failure
of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereby that would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_;
_provided that_ , in the case of clause (c), the failure to comply with this
_Section 7.11_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_, or give rise to any right to
terminate this Agreement under _Article IX_, if the underlying fact,
circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right.

 



 

 **7.12** ** ****_Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to Partnership
Common Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.13** ** ****_Distributions_**. Each of the Partnership and Parent will
consult with the Other Party regarding the declaration and payment of
distributions in respect of Partnership Common Units, the Parent Common Units,
Parent Class B Units, and Parent Preferred Units occurring after the date of
this Agreement, and the record and payment dates relating thereto, to ensure
that no Partnership Unitholder receives two distributions, or fails to receive
one distribution, for any single calendar month or quarter, as applicable,
with respect to either (a) the Partnership Common Units or (b) the Parent
Common Units any such Partnership Unitholder will receive in exchange for
Partnership Common Units pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

 **7.14** ** ****_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the date that is five days prior to
the Closing Date (the " ** _Interview Period_** "), Parent shall have the
right to conduct interviews with respect to all of the Employees. At any time
prior to the expiration of the Interview Period, Parent shall, in its sole
discretion, determine and inform the Partnership of which Employees Parent
will make an offer of employment to effective as of and expressly conditioned
upon the completion of the Closing. Any Employee designated to receive an
offer of employment from Parent or Parents Affiliate shall be deemed an " **
_Offered Employee_**." The Parent or Parents Affiliates offer of employment
may be in the form of a Qualified Offer or an Unqualified Offer. Each offer of
employment shall be in writing and is expressly subject to an Offered
Employees satisfaction of Parents standard on-boarding process and
procedures, including pre-employment drug testing and background check
procedures. Parent shall inform the Partnership promptly of the identity of
any Offered Employee who does not accept the applicable employment offer of
Parent or Parents Affiliate. Offered Employees who accept an applicable offer
of employment from Parent or Parents Affiliate and commence employment with
the Parent or Parents Affiliate on the Closing Date shall be deemed " **
_Continuing Employees_**." If an Employee that Parent or Parents Affiliate
wishes to offer employment is not actively at work five days prior to Closing
Date because the Employee is on workers compensation, on an approved leave of
absence (including an approved leave of absence with a legal or contractual
right to reinstatement, military leave, maternity leave, or leave under the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993) or absent due to disability, illness or
other similar circumstance (each, an " ** _Absent Employee_** ")), Parent or
Parents Affiliate shall make such offer of employment to be effective upon
the expiration of the approved leave of absence or the Absent Employees other
return from workers compensation, disability, illness or other similar
circumstance, provided that such offer of employment shall remain valid no
longer than 90 days following the Closing Date. An Absent Employee who does
not return to work after the expiration of an approved leave of absence or
otherwise under the preceding sentence shall not be considered a Continuing
Employee hereunder and their offer of employment shall be null and void. The
Partnership shall cause the Partnership or its Subsidiary, as applicable, to
terminate the employment of all of the Employees effective as of and expressly
conditioned upon the completion of the Closing. Except as otherwise provided
within this Agreement or a Partnership Employee Benefit Plan, if any Offered
Employee elects not to become a Continuing Employee (a " ** _Retiring
Employee_** "), none of the Partnership, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to pay severance or any other benefit to
such Retiring Employee.

 



 

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the
date of termination of the applicable Continuing Employee) (the " **
_Continuation Period_** "), Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each of the Continuing
Employees who remains in the active employment of Parent or any of its
Affiliates with (i) a base salary or wages that are no less than such
Continuing Employees base salary or wages as of the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
employee benefits that Parent provides to its similarly situated employees
during such period.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.14_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Partnership or any of their respective Affiliates, other than
the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the
matters provided for in this _Section 7.14_) under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 7.14_ amends, or will
be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination of) any
Partnership Employee Benefit Plan or any Parent Employee Benefit Plan. Parent
(i) has no obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any
Continuing Employee for any period of time following the Effective Time and
(ii) except as specifically provided in this _Section 7.14_ , will be entitled
to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other terms or
conditions of employment of, any such employees in its absolute discretion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.14(c)_ or within
any Partnership Employee Benefit Plan, any decisions made by the Partnership,
the Parent or any Parent Affiliate, either prior to, in connection with or
following the Effective Time, with respect to any participants under such
arrangements or plans, shall be made by the appropriate party exercising its
good faith discretion and, to the extent that a disagreement or dispute arises
over any issue related to a Partnership Employee Benefit Plan that is not
already subject to customary ERISA claims procedures, such disagreement or
dispute shall be submitted to mandatory arbitration.

 



 

 **7.15** ** ****_Transaction Litigation_**. The Partnership shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any security
holder litigation against the Partnership, Partnership GP, Partnership GP LLC
or their respective directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall give the
Partnership the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
security holder litigation against the Parent or its directors relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of the
Partnership, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

 **7.16** ** ****_Financing Cooperation_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense,
provide all cooperation that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with any financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the LRR
Agreement as may be reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership Entities
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, (i) furnish,
as promptly as practicable, the report of the Partnerships auditor on the
most recently available

 



      
 

 



 

audited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
of such auditor to the use of such report in accordance with normal custom and
practice, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such auditor to
provide customary comfort letters (providing "negative assurance" comfort) and
drafts thereof to the underwriters, administrative agent, lenders, initial
purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in connection with such
financing by Parent; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, as
promptly as practicable, financial statements and other financial data of the
Partnership as would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act for a registered public offering to
consummate any offering(s) of securities contemplated by such financing; (iii)
provide reasonable and customary assistance in the preparation of one or more
confidential information memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials (including
the provision of authorization letters and a representation with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information) reasonably
requested by Parent, including by making available, at reasonable times and on
reasonable advance notice, employees and advisors of the Partnership Entities;
(iv) in a reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and road shows, in each case, upon reasonable
advance notice and at mutually agreed times; (v) assisting Parent in
connection with the preparation and registration of (but not executing) any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements,
other definitive financing documents, or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources or otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral in connection with the financing of
the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the LRR Agreement
(provided that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time);
(vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication
efforts benefit from existing lending and investment banking relationships;
and (vii) providing all customary documentation and other information about
the Partnership, the Partnership GP and their respective Subsidiaries
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources in connection with the financing
of the Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the LRR Agreement and
required under applicable "know your customer" sanctions and anti-money-
laundering rules and regulations; _provided_ that (x) none of the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with such
financing or to take any action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law
or cause a default of, or breach under, or otherwise violate any Partnership
Material Agreement, in each case except for any payment, incurrence or action
that is conditioned upon, and shall not take effect until, the Effective Time,
(y) no obligations of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or other document or instrument
delivered pursuant to this _Section 7.16_ shall be effective until the
Effective Time, and none of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section 7.16_ under any
certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or other document or instrument that
is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time and (z) none of the Partnership or its senior officers shall be
required to engage in any action that would interfere unreasonably with the
business of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, Partnership GP and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any
financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions and the transactions contemplated by the LRR Agreement

 



       
 

 



 

and any information utilized in connection therewith except (A) with respect
to information supplied by the Partnership, its Subsidiaries and
Representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein and/or (B) to the extent such losses and damages arise from the
willful misconduct of the Partnerships or any of its Subsidiaries
Representatives.

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent;

 



 

(b) by the Partnership or Parent if there is in effect a final nonappealable
order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Partnership, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if such order was primarily due to the
failure of any Partnership Entity, on the one hand, or any of Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Parent if (i) any Partnership Entity has breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of any Partnership
Entity becomes untrue, and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_
above, which breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of
the Closing Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to
perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if
capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured (or does not become
true) by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following
receipt by the Partnership of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from
Parent;

 



 

(d) by the Partnership if (i) Parent has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of Parent becomes untrue,
and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above, which breach,
failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing Date

of such breach, failure or untruth from the Partnership;

 



 

(e) by the Partnership or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before
January 31, 2016 (the " ** _Outside Date_** "); _provided_ that such failure
of the Closing to occur is not due to the failure of such Party to perform and
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be
performed or complied with by such Party prior to the Closing;

 



 

(f) by the Partnership or Parent if, after the final adjournment of the
Partnership Meeting at which a vote of the Partnership Unitholders has been

any Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring
prior to termination, or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in

contemplated hereby.

 **10.8** ** ****_Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding

judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any of
its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in

Financing Source or any Finance Related Party, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan (and the
Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in,
such court in

 



      
 

 



 

connection therewith), and that the provisions of _Section 10.9_ relating to
waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim.

 



 

 **10.9** ** ****_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND
COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE,
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER,
RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING

 **10.10** ** ****_No Recourse_** _._ This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance

identified as Parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,

liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **10.11** ** ****_Specific Performance_**. The Parties agree that irreparable

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 10.11_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) each Party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

_provided, however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the
Parties in _Sections _ _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _7.10_ , _7.15_ and _Article
_ _X_ will survive the Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, the agreements of the Parties in _Sections _ _7.6_ , _9.2_ ,

stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and
each of their successors and assigns (collectively, " ** _Finance Related
