induce any customer or supplier of the Division as of the Closing Date to limit,

for a period of at least six (6) years after the Closing all books, records and

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller shall be provided

with each other, and will cause their officers and employees to so cooperate, in
the furnishing of information, testimony and other assistance in connection with
any action, judicial or administrative proceeding, claim or dispute to which any
party is or becomes a party relating to the Assets, Division, Assumed
Liabilities or Excluded Liabilities, or in connection with the preparation of

Buyers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other

     10.3      Bulk Sales.  Seller and Buyers hereby waive the provisions of
               ----------
any applicable Bulk Sales Laws.

     10.4      Employment.
               ----------

               (a)  Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer Sub shall offer employment
(such employment to become effective as of the Closing) to those employees of
Seller and its affiliates who are listed on Schedule 10.4 hereto (all such
employees hereinafter referred to as "Eligible Employees"). For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto agree that Schedule 10.4 shall include employees who
are on workers' compensation or short term disability leave of absence. All such
offers of employment shall be made in accordance with all applicable laws and
regulations and shall offer terms of employment (including, without limitation,
salary levels, bonus opportunities, commissions, pension and welfare benefits,
severance benefits, vacation and fringe benefits) which are comparable in the
aggregate to those which are provided to similarly situated United States
employees of Buyer and Buyer's United States affiliates. Each Eligible Employee
who accepts such an offer shall become an employee of Buyer Sub as of the
Closing (each such person referred to hereinafter as a "Transferred Employee").
Effective as of the Closing, each Eligible Employee shall cease to be employed
by Seller and, except as required by law, participation by each such Eligible
Employee in Seller's Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 16.9) shall cease.
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer Sub shall pay, discharge and be
responsible for all salary, wages, benefits and any other claims arising out of
or relating to the employment of the Transferred Employees by Buyer Sub from and
after the Closing, and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless against any
expenses, costs, claims or other liabilities associated with such employment.

                                      53
<PAGE>

               (b)  With respect to each plan of Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer
maintained following the Closing Date in which any Transferred Employee
participates (each a "Buyer's Plan") that is a severance or termination pay plan
or an "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
(including severance benefits and vacation entitlement, but not accruals under
any defined benefit pension plan), service with Seller or its affiliates (or
predecessor employers to the extent Seller provided past service credit) shall
be treated as service with Buyer or such affiliate, as the case may be;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations. With respect to each Transferred Employee, each Buyer's Plan shall
waive any pre-existing condition limitations, waiting period requirements or
evidence of insurability requirements. Transferred Employees shall be given
credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Buyer's Plan. Nothing contained in this Section 10.4 shall be
construed as requiring Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer to continue the
employment of any Transferred Employee following the Closing Date.

               (c)  If an Eligible Employee's response to an offer of employment
made by Buyer Sub in compliance with Section 10.4(a) qualifies such Eligible
Employee for termination pay or severance pay under any termination or severance
plan of Seller, then Seller shall be responsible for such payments. Buyer Sub
shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold

                                      54
<PAGE>

Seller harmless with respect to, all severance benefits or termination pay that
becomes payable in connection with any failure by Buyer Sub to comply with
Section 10.4(a) or as a result of termination of any Transferred Employee's
employment with Buyer Sub following the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as an acknowledgment or admission of liability to pay termination
or severance pay pursuant to any plan or program of Seller or Buyer.

               (d)  Effective as of the Closing Date, all Eligible Employees
shall cease participation in the CLP Profit Sharing and Savings Plan and the CLP
Hourly Union Saving Plan (collectively, "Seller's Savings Plans"). As soon as
practicable following the Closing, Buyer or an affiliate thereof shall
designate, or establish, a savings plan or savings plans, qualified under
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, and a trust or trusts thereunder that
are exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code (such plan or plans,
"Buyer's 401(k) Plan"), and shall allow all Transferred Employees previously
eligible to participate in Seller's Savings Plans to participate in Buyer's
401(k) Plan on the same terms and conditions as apply to other similarly
situated employees of Buyers or such affiliate (if applicable), with service
credit as described in Section 10.4(b). Buyer agrees that for a period of one
year following the Closing Date the core contribution to Buyer's 401(k) Plan
shall be increased based upon 2001 performance to reflect the overall employer
contribution with respect to the CLP Profit Sharing and Savings Plan and the
benefit accrual under the Seller's Pension Plan. As soon as practicable after
the designation or establishment of Buyer's 401(k) Plan, and upon (i) the
provision by Buyer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller, which may be
in the form of an opinion of Buyer's counsel, that Buyer's 401(k) Plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code; (ii) the provision by Seller of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer,

                                      55
<PAGE>

which may be in the form of an opinion of Seller's counsel that Seller's Savings
Plans are qualified under Section 401(c) of the Code and exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code; and (iii) satisfaction of any other applicable legal
requirements to such transfer, Seller shall cause Seller's Savings Plans to
transfer to the trust or trusts established under Buyer's 401(k) Plan, in cash
or in other property reasonably acceptable to Buyer's 401(k) Plan's trustee, the
full account balances of all Transferred Employees who have elected to
participate in Buyer's 401(k) Plan, determined as of the date of transfer and
without regard to any applicable vesting schedule under Seller's Savings Plans.
As soon as practicable following the Closing, Seller shall make a contribution
to Seller's Savings Plans for the period commencing January 1, 2000 and ending
December 31, 2000 with respect to the Transferred Employees (the "Profit Sharing
Contribution"). As soon as practicable following the profit sharing contribution
to the CLP Profit Sharing and Savings Plan in respect of calendar year 2000, if
any, Seller shall cause the CLP Profit Sharing and Savings Plan to make a second
transfer to the trust established under Buyer's 401(k) Plan, in cash or other
property reasonably acceptable to Buyer's 401(k) Plan's trustee, of the full
account balances of all Eligible Transferred Employees (as defined in Section
16.9) then participating in Buyer's 401(k) Plan, determined as of the date of
transfer. Seller and Buyer shall enter into an agreement reasonably satisfactory
to Seller and Buyer and reflecting the terms of such transfer. The transfer of
account balances and liabilities pursuant to this Section 10.4(d) is intended to
comply with Section 414(l) of the Code and any other applicable legal
requirements for such a transfer. From and after such transfer, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller's Savings Plans and Seller, as well as their
respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries,
as applicable, from and against all losses, liabilities

                                      56
<PAGE>

and expenses, including reasonable expenses and fees of counsel, attributable to
any action or inaction of Buyer with respect to the account balances and
liabilities transferred to Buyer's 401(k) Plan, except to the extent that such
losses are due to acts or omissions of Seller accruing prior to such transfer.
As to such matters, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer's 401(k) Plan
and Buyer, as well as their respective affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and fiduciaries, as applicable, from and against all losses,
liabilities and expenses, including reasonable expenses and fees of counsel,
attributable to any such acts or omissions of Seller. Buyer shall be responsible
for the profit sharing accrual with respect to the CLP Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan for the period commencing on January 1, 2000 and ending on December
31, 2000 and shall reimburse Seller with respect to the Profit Sharing
Contribution within thirty (30) days of Closing (but not later than March 1,
2001).

               (e)  As of the Closing, Buyer shall assume and agree to perform
the Incentive Plan with respect to those Transferred Employees who are
participants in such plan as of the Closing with respect to calendar year 2000.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller agrees to pay to the
participating Transferred Employees any earned and unpaid amounts under such
plan in accordance with Seller's past practice. Seller further agrees that it
will not amend the Transition Incentive Plan (as defined in Section 16.9) with
respect to any Transferred Employee following the date hereof without the prior
written consent of Buyer.

               (f)  The applicable health plan of Seller shall retain
responsibility for all eligible services or payments provided to Eligible
Employees (or any of their dependents) under any such plan prior to the Closing
Date. Seller shall retain Seller's Pension Plan and all liabilities and
obligations thereunder, including, without limitation, obligations for benefits

                                      57
<PAGE>

payable under Seller's Pension Plan for Eligible Employees and former Employees
and obligations to make contributions to such plan. Seller shall cause each
Eligible Employee to become fully vested in his or her benefit under Seller's
Pension Plan as of the Closing. Buyers shall assume and agree to perform, as of
the Closing, the Division's Employee Assistance Program and the HMO agreements
covering certain employees subject to the CBAs and the Division's Employee
Assistance Program. Seller shall make all payments in respect of such HMO
agreements which become due prior to the Closing Date.

               (g)  The obligation for compliance with the federal Worker
Adjustment, Retraining and Notification Act (the "WARN Act") and for compliance
with the Wisconsin Plant Closing Law shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the
Closing relative to all Eligible Employees. Effective as of the Closing, the
insurance policies currently maintained by Seller, including in respect of
workers compensation and general liability coverage, will terminate insofar as
it relates to the business of the Division. Buyer will assume (and will
indemnify Seller for) liabilities relating to workers compensation and general
liability insurance claims arising out of the business of the Division that are
based on events occurring on or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall offer to
assume the CBAs. Said offer shall be made in writing by Buyer to the Union prior
to the Closing Date. In the event that the Union refuses to be bound by such
assumption, then Buyer shall offer to recognize and bargain with the Union as
representative of the unit of employees described in the agreement, and shall
not alter or amend any hours, wages or other terms and conditions of employment
applicable to employees in said agreement until such bargaining has produced
agreement or lawful impasse, all as defined by applicable labor laws.

                                      58
<PAGE>

               (h)  Buyer shall have the right to be informed with respect to
any negotiation by Seller with respect to any collective bargaining agreement
occurring prior to Closing.

               (i)  Immediately prior to, and subject to, the Closing, Seller
shall cause a "spin-off" of the liabilities of Beneflex Component Plan of the
CLP Health and Welfare Plan (which contains dependent care and medical health
reimbursement component parts) with respect to the Transferred Employees (the
"Transferred Flex Plan"). At the Closing, Seller shall cause the Transferred
Flex Plan, including the benefit liabilities of the Transferred Employees, to be
transferred to Buyer. The parties hereto agree that in no event shall Seller's
liabilities with respect to the Transferred Flex Plan exceed the amount deferred
by Transferred Employees during 2001 and prior to the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall draft the appropriate documents in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory Buyer, and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to take all actions necessary, to the extent possible, to effectuate the intent
of this Section 10.4(i).

               (j)  As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the obligation
to make payments to each Eligible Employee who is then on short term disability
leave and shall continue to make such payments in accordance with the applicable
short term disability plan of Seller in accordance with the provisions of such
plan as in effect on the date hereof.

     10.5      Government Filings. Seller and Buyers shall use their respective
               ------------------
reasonable efforts to make or cause to be made in a timely manner all filings
with, and to obtain or cause to be obtained in a timely manner all Permits,
consents or approvals of any Governmental Agency required to be made or obtained
in connection with the Transaction.

                                      59
<PAGE>

     10.6      Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyers
               --------------------
shall consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any press release or
public announcement pertaining to the Transaction and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public announcement prior to such consultation
and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable efforts
to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press
release or making any such public announcement.

     10.7      Further Assurances. Each party shall (a) upon request of any
               ------------------
other party, at any time and from time to time execute, acknowledge, deliver and
perform all such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances,
powers of attorney and instruments of further assurances as may reasonably be
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions and intent of this
Agreement and (b) from and after the date of this Agreement and to and including
the Closing Date, unless all other parties otherwise consent in writing, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to satisfy, (i) in the case of Buyers, the
conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller in Article XII, and, (ii) in
the case of Seller, the conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyers in
Article XI.

     10.8      Consents. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute
               --------
or require an assignment or an attempt to assign any of the Assets if the
attempted assignment without the consent of a third party would adversely affect
in any way the rights of either Seller or Buyers. If any such consent shall not
have been obtained at or prior to the Closing, or the attempted transfer or
assignment of any of the Assets would have an adverse effect on Buyers or
Seller, Seller will

                                      60
<PAGE>

cooperate with Buyers in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide for
Buyers the rights and benefits of such Assets, including, enforcing for the
benefit of Buyers any or all rights of Seller under any agreements against any
other party arising out of the breach or cancellation by such other party, while
permitting Buyers the possession and use of such Assets for Buyers' account as
if such Assets had been so transferred, assigned and delivered, or otherwise.
Pending the obtaining of such consents, approvals or novations, Buyers will
continue performance of any remaining unfulfilled obligations of Seller under
any of the agreements in the same manner as though the same were subcontracted
to Buyers on the same terms and conditions as contained in the agreements. To
the extent that Buyers are provided the benefits of any agreement referred to
herein (whether from Seller or otherwise), Buyers shall perform at the
reasonable direction of Seller and for the benefit of any third Person the
obligations of Seller thereunder or in connection therewith, and Buyers agree to
pay, perform and discharge and indemnify Seller against and hold Seller harmless
from, all obligations and liabilities of Seller relating to such performance or
failure to perform, after the Closing Date, in accordance with Article XV.

     10.9      Nonsolicitation. For a period of two (2) years from and after the
               ---------------
Closing Date, (a) Seller will not, directly or indirectly, for itself or for any
other Person (other than Buyers or any of their affiliates), (i) employ, attempt
to employ or enter into any contractual employment arrangement with any person
who is a current employee of the Division or (ii) interfere with the business
relations between Buyers or any of their affiliates and any Person who is a
current consultant or independent contractor of the Division, and (b) Buyers
will not, directly or indirectly, for themselves or for any other Person (other
than Seller or any of its affiliates),

                                      61
<PAGE>

employ, attempt to employ or enter into any contractual employment arrangement
with any person who is a current employee of Seller or any affiliate of Seller.

     10.10     Unemployment Compensation Accounts.  Seller shall cause, if
               ----------------------------------
permitted by law, its unemployment compensation accounts with any state to be
transferred to Buyer Sub if requested by Buyer.

     10.11     Mayville Site. Buyers shall be responsible for completing the
               -------------
investigation and remediation of contamination arising from the Release of
Hazardous Materials prior to the Closing Date at the Owned Real Property in
Mayville, Wisconsin and any migration of such contamination to any other
properties at any time (collectively, the "Mayville Contamination") until a
closure letter is obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
("WDNR"). After Buyers have completed the site investigation in accordance with
applicable rules, Buyers will prepare a remedial action plan and submit it to
Seller for review and comment before Buyers submit the plan to WDNR. Seller may
participate in any meetings with the WDNR at its own expense. Buyers will keep
Seller informed of response activities undertaken at the Mayville Site. Buyers
shall be responsible for complying with any conditions of the WDNR closure
letter. Buyers shall notify Seller when Buyers have expended $1,000,000 for
Response Costs (as defined in Section 16.9) to address the Mayville
Contamination (the "Mayville Response Costs"). Seller shall, upon receipt of
such notice, promptly reimburse Buyers for fifty percent (50%) of all Mayville
Response Costs in excess of $1,000,000 incurred by Buyers.

     If after the Closing Date, Buyers or Seller receive notice of any third
party claims arising from or relating to the Mayville Contamination, they shall
promptly notify the other party as provided in Section 15.6(a). Buyers and
Seller shall cooperate with each other in responding to

                                      62
<PAGE>

such claims, however, each shall have the right to join the other in the action.
Buyers and Seller shall each be responsible for its own defense and attorneys
fees, unless the parties subsequently agree to a joint defense arrangement and
defense cost sharing. The costs arising from any settlement or judgment
resolving such third party claims ("Mayville Third Party Environmental Costs")
shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller; provided, however, that if Buyers
have not expended $1,000,000 for Mayville Response Costs at the time that any
Mayville Third Party Environmental Costs are incurred, Buyers shall be
responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of the Mayville Third Party
Environmental Costs until Buyers' total combined payments of Mayville Response
Costs and Mayville Third Party Environmental Costs exceed $1,000,000.

     10.12     Title Insurance and ALTA Surveys. Seller, on the one hand, and
               --------------------------------
Buyers, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other to obtain, shall
obtain and deliver to Buyers and shall each bear one-half of the costs of
obtaining, (a) at least ten (10) days prior to Closing a commitment (the "Title
Commitment") for an owner's policy of title insurance (including the 3.1 Zoning
Endorsement, Access Endorsement, Gap Coverage, CLTA Form 100.6 Covenants,
Conditions and Restrictions, Violations for the Owned Real Property located in
Arizona and in North Carolina and Contiguity Endorsement, as appropriate, for
the operations being conducted on each of the Owned Real Property, to the extent

covering title to the Owned Real Property, showing title in Seller subject only
to such exceptions set forth on Schedule 6.8 hereto and committing to insure the
interest of Buyer Sub, as owner of each Owned

Real Property, with extended coverage, other than (i) the general mechanic's

           (a) Any party making a claim for indemnification under this Article
XV (the "Indemnitee") shall notify the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor") of
the claim in writing promptly after discovering the claim or receiving written
notice of a claim against the Indemnitee (if by a third party), describing the
claim and the amount (if known and quantifiable), and the basis thereof;
provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the
Indemnitor of such claim shall relieve the Indemnitor from any liability or
obligation under this Article XV and then solely to the extent that the
Indemnitor is damaged thereby.

           (b) If any action or proceeding is brought against the Indemnitee,
with respect to which the Indemnitor may have an obligation to indemnify under
this Article XV, the action or proceeding shall be defended (including all
proceedings on appeal or for review which counsel for the Indemnitee shall deem
appropriate) by the Indemnitor with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor, within a reasonable time
after notice of claim, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to undertake the defense,

                                      73
<PAGE>

compromise or settlement of such claim for the account of the Indemnitor,
subject to the right of the Indemnitor to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee at any time
prior to the compromise, settlement or final determination thereof. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the Indemnitee's own expense
unless the employment of such counsel and the payment of such fees and expenses
both shall have been specifically authorized by the Indemnitor in connection
with the defense of such action or proceeding. In case of such specific
authorization by Indemnitor, only that portion of such fees and expenses
reasonably related to matters covered by the indemnity agreements contained in
this Agreement shall be borne by the Indemnitor.

     The Indemnitee shall be kept fully informed of such action or proceeding at
all stages whether or not it is so represented. The Indemnitee shall make
available to the Indemnitor and its attorneys and accountants all books and
records of the Indemnitee relating to such proceedings or litigation and the
parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably
require of each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any
such action or proceeding.

          (c) The Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the matter without the written consent
of the Indemnitor (not to be withheld unreasonably), and the Indemnitor will not
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter, or any
settlement which does not include a provision pursuant to which plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases the Indemnitee from all liability with respect
thereto, without the written consent of the Indemnitee.
