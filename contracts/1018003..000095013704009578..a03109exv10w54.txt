            agrees to buy the Shares from the Seller, on the terms and
            conditions of this agreement.


1.2         Free from Encumbrance

            The Shares must be transferred free from any Encumbrance and with
            all rights, including dividend rights, attached or accruing to them
            whether before or after Completion.

1.3         More than one seller

            (a) (references to "Seller" and "Shares") References to the "Seller"
                means each of those persons and references to "Shares" means, in
                relation to each person, the Shares in the Company described
                opposite that person's name in Schedule 2.

            (b) (simultaneous completion) The Buyer is not obliged to Complete
                unless each Seller Completes simultaneously.

            (c) (waiver of pre-emption rights) Each Seller waives in favour of
                the Buyer any pre-emption or other rights which it has now or
                might otherwise have in respect of any of the Shares held by
                each other Seller.

            (d) (Liability) Subject to clause 9.3 ("Maximum Liability") and
                clause 1.3(e), the Liability of each Seller under this agreement
                is several (and not joint) in their Respective Proportions
                (other than in respect of a breach of a Personal Warranty) and
                no Seller is liable for and subject to paragraph (e), neither
                the Buyer nor the Guarantor may make a claim against a Seller in
                connection with this agreement or the transactions contemplated
                by it in excess of the relevant Seller's Respective Proportion
                of that Liability.

            (e) (Personal Warranties) Each Seller is liable for any breach of a
                Personal Warranty given by that Seller. To avoid doubt, and
                without prejudice to clause 9.3, each Seller's Liability in
                respect of its Personal Warranties is limited to that Seller's
                Respective Proportion of the Purchase Price. No Seller is liable
                for and neither the Buyer nor the Guarantor may make a claim
                against a Seller for breach of a Personal Warranty given by any
                other Seller.

            (f) (payments) Other than as provided for in this agreement, any
                payment to be made by the Buyer to the Seller must be paid to
                the Seller Representative which payment will constitute the full
                and


                                                                               3

                such payment to a Seller.

            (g) (payments by Seller) Where the Seller has an obligation to pay
                an amount, each Seller's obligation is to pay that Seller's
                Respective Proportion of that amount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2           Purchase Price and funds flow

2.1         Purchase Price

            The aggregate price payable for the Shares is the sum of:

            (a) an amount equal to the Goodwill Amount; and

            (b) an amount equal to the Net Tangible Assets at Adjustment
                Statement Date; and

            (c) an amount equal to the Notional Interest Amount.

2.2         Allocation of Purchase Price

            The Purchase Price is to be paid and allocated subject to clause 5
            in the following manner:

            (a) first, toward the price payable for each Preference Share which
                is the sum of:

                (i) $1; and

               (ii) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid dividend on that
                    Preference Share as at the Completion Date.

            (b) second, in the case of Sellers who are entitled to the benefit
                of "subordinated shareholder loans" (as referred to in Schedule
                7), the aggregate amount of those "subordinated shareholder
                loans" to those Sellers in proportion to their entitlement; and

            (c) third, toward the aggregate price payable for the Ordinary
                Shares ("Ordinary Shares Purchase Price"), which is the Purchase
                Price less the aggregate price payable for all of the Preference
                Shares calculated under clause 2.2(a) and less the amount
                payable under clause 2.2(b). The price payable for each Ordinary
                Share is an amount equal to the Ordinary Shares Purchase Price
                divided by the total number of Ordinary Shares.

            The Sellers acknowledge in favour of the Seller Representative that
            their entitlement as against the Seller Representative to payment on
            account of the Ordinary Share Purchase Price is reduced subject to
            and as required by clause 5.1(b) and clause 5.18 ("Escrow Account")
            and clause 5.28(a) ("Net Tangible Asset adjustment - retention") and
            5.28(c) ("Transaction Costs").


                                                                               4

                of any cost or Liability (other than filing and other fees
                associated with obtaining the approvals)) to obtain the

                Seller Representative must deliver the US GAAP Accounts to the
                Buyer immediately upon their finalisation.

3.3         Termination of agreement

            (b) If any of the Conditions Precedent are not fulfilled by 31
                December 2004 or any later date agreed by the Seller
                Representative and the Buyer and have not been waived by the
                Seller Representative and the Buyer then this agreement will
                automatically terminate without any requirement by the Seller or
                the Buyer to provide any notice of termination.

3.4         Effect of termination

            If this agreement is terminated under clause 3.3 ("Termination of

                other than in relation to clauses 16 ("Costs") and 12
                ("Confidential Information");


                                                                               6


<PAGE>


            (b) each party retains the rights it has against any other party in
                respect of any breach or Claim that has arisen before
                termination; and

            (c) the Buyer must return to the Seller or destroy all documents and
                other materials in any medium in its possession, power or
                control which contain any information relating to the Company
                and its Subsidiaries, including the Records.

3.5         Failure of GAAP condition

            (a) In addition to the Seller's rights (if any) under clause 3.4,
                where the condition in clause 3.1(d) is not fulfilled on 31
                December 2004, the Guarantor must on that day ("due date") pay
                or procure payment of $8.351 million ("Termination Amount") to
                the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative must
                nominate the account into which the Termination Amount is to be
                paid by 29 December 2004.

            (b) If the Guarantor does not pay the Termination Amount in full by
                the due date, interest accrues on the Termination Amount or any
                unpaid portion daily (calculated on the basis of a 365 day year)
                at the rate of 9% per annum and compounds monthly from the due
                date until the date the Termination Amount together with
                interest thereon calculated in accordance with this clause 3.5
                is paid in full.

            (c) To avoid doubt, this clause 3.5 survives termination of this
                agreement under clause 3.3.

3.6         Non-solicitation

            If this agreement is terminated, for a period of 12 months from the
            date of termination of this agreement:

                Controlled by the Guarantor of it directly or indirectly
                solicits without the Seller Representative's consent the
                employment of, or the engagement for the provision of services
                of, any person currently employed by a Group Company in a senior
                management position in the Group as a whole; and

            (b) each Seller will procure (insofar as it is able) that neither it
                nor any Group Company directly or indirectly solicits without
                the Buyer's consent the employment of, or the engagement for the
                provision of services of, any person currently employed by the
                Buyer or any entity Controlled by the Guarantor in a senior
                management position in the group comprising the Guarantor and
                the entities it Controls.

3.7         Exception

            The restriction in clause 3.6 ("Non-solicitation") does not apply
            where such an employee responds to a bona fide advertising or
            recruiting campaign which is targeted to a wide audience of
            potential applicants or initiates employment discussions themselves.


                                                                               7

            (b) If there is or has been any Escrow Buyer Claim Or Action by the
                Escrow Second Payment Date, the Seller Representative and the
                Buyer must procure that the Agent pays to the Seller
                Representative on the immediately following Business Day after
                the Escrow Second Payment Date, the Escrow Account Balance
                together with any accrued interest credited to the Escrow
                Account in respect of such amount (other than interest due to
                the Buyer under clause 5.25) less the aggregate amount of all
                Outstanding Escrow Buyer Claims Or Actions as at the Escrow
                Second Payment Date.

            (c) If:

                (i) a Claim or Claimed Amount is included in Outstanding Escrow
                    Buyer Claims Or Actions under paragraph (a)(ii) above; and

               (ii) following the Escrow First Payment Date and before the
                    Escrow Second Payment Date, that Claim or Claimed Amount:

                    (A) becomes an Agreed Claim for an amount less than the
                        Claimed Amount; or

                    (B) is withdrawn or not pursued by the Buyer; or

                    (C) ceases to be enforceable under clause 9.1(b) or clause
                        9.1(c),

                then the Buyer and the Seller Representative must procure the
                Agent to pay to the Seller Representative promptly following
                that event an amount equal to the amount that would have been
                payable under paragraph (a) above had the event subsisted at
                that Escrow Amount Payment Date less the aggregate amount
                previously paid under that paragraph (a) and this paragraph (c),
                together with any interest accrued under clause 5.20 ("Interest
                on Escrow Balance") in respect of that amount.

            (d) If:

                (i) a Claim or Claimed Amount is included in Outstanding Escrow
                    Buyer Claims Or Actions under paragraph (b) above; and

<PAGE>


               (ii) following the Escrow Second Payment Date, that Claim or
                    Claimed Amount:

                    (A) becomes an Agreed Claim for an amount less than the
                        Claimed Amount; or

                    (B) is withdrawn or not pursued by the Buyer; or

                    (C) ceases to be enforceable under clause 9.1(b) or clause
                        9.1(c),

                then the Buyer and the Seller Representative must procure the
                Agent to pay to the Seller Representative promptly following
                that event an amount equal to the amount that would have been
                payable under paragraph (b) above had the event subsisted at
                that Escrow Amount Payment Date less the aggregate amount
                previously paid under that paragraph (b) and this paragraph (d),
                together with any interest accrued under clause 5.20 ("Interest
                on Escrow Balance") in respect of that amount.

5.23        Unagreed Claims notice

            If at either of the Escrow Amount Payment Dates there are any
            Unagreed Claims, the Buyer must notify the Seller Representative in
            writing by the relevant Escrow Amount Payment Date in respect of
            each Unagreed Claim, the Buyer's estimate, in good faith and acting
            reasonably of the amount of such Claim ("Claimed Amount").

5.24        Resolution of Claims

            If an Escrow Buyer Claim Or Action becomes an Agreed Claim at any
            time, the Seller Representative and the Buyer must, on the
            immediately following Business Day, procure the Agent to pay to the
            Buyer the amount due to the Buyer in respect of the Agreed Claim
            ("Agreed Claim Amount") (provided that such amount may only be to
            the extent of the Escrow Account Balance (if any)).

5.25        Interest accruing to Buyer

            The interest which accrues on that amount of the Escrow Account
            Balance equal to any Agreed Claim Amount (together with any interest
            accruing on amounts credited to the Escrow Account as interest on
            that Agreed Claim Amount of the Escrow Account Balance) is for the
            benefit of the Buyer from the date on which the Agreed Claim Amount
            is payable to the Buyer under clause 5.24 ("Resolution of Claims").
            The Buyer may require amounts credited to the Escrow Account by way
            of interest which are payable to the Buyer under this clause to be
            released from the Escrow Account and paid to it from time to time.

5.26        Sole recourse for General Claims

            (a) The Buyer and the Guarantor each agree that the sole recourse
                and remedy for the Buyer and the sole Liability of the Seller in
                respect of the subject matter of any General Claim is to the
                extent of the Escrow Account Balance (up to the amount due to
                the Buyer in respect of the General Claim) at the time the
                General Claim is payable to the Buyer.


                                                                              19
<PAGE>


                Where the General Claim is payable, the Seller has no Liability
                in respect of the subject matter of the General Claim to the
                extent that the amount of the General Claim is greater than the
                Escrow Account Balance.

            (b) The Buyer may make Escrow Buyer Claims Or Actions that are not
                General Claims provided that the Escrow Amount and the Escrow
                Account Balance will be reduced by payments under this clause 5
                to satisfy Escrow Buyer Claims Or Actions that are not General
                Claims.

            (c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in clause 5.26(a) limits or
                restricts the Buyer from seeking any recourse or remedy in
                respect of the subject matter of any Buyer Claim Or Action that
                is not a General Claim that becomes an Agreed Claim from the
                Escrow Account Balance from time to time.

5.27        Buyer Claims

            For the avoidance of doubt, any amount paid to the Buyer (including
            from the Escrow Account) in respect of a breach of any of the
            Warranties must, notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, be
            deemed to be a reduction in the Purchase Price. The reduction must
            be applied:

            (a) first, in reducing the price payable for the Ordinary Shares
                (pro rata as between each Ordinary Share); and

            (b) thereafter, in reducing the price payable for the Preference
                Shares (pro rata as between each Preference Share).

                    reasonable discretion of that payment ("Retention Amount").
                    Seller must do this on a basis that does not discriminate
                    amongst Sellers.

               (ii) If no payment to the Buyer is required under clause
                    5.15(a)(ii), the Seller Representative must within 5
                    Business Days pay the Retention Amount to the Sellers in
                    immediately available funds in their Respective Proportions.

              (iii) If a payment to the Buyer is required under clause
                    5.15(a)(ii) ("Required Payment"), the Seller Representative
                    may apply the Retention Amount to that payment on behalf of
                    the Sellers in accordance with clause 5.15(b).

               (iv) If the Retention Amount is greater than the Required
                    Payment, the Seller Representative must within 5 Business
                    Days pay the excess to the Sellers in immediately available
                    funds in their Respective Proportions.


                                                                              20
<PAGE>


                (v) If the Retention Amount is less than the Required Payment,
                    the Seller Representative may apply the entire Retention
                    Amount to that payment on behalf of the Sellers in
                    accordance with clause 5.15 (b) and each Seller must within
                    2 Business Days of notice from the Seller Representative put
                    the Seller Representative in immediately available funds to
                    enable the Seller Representative, on behalf of that Seller,
                    to comply with that Seller's obligations under clause
                    5.15(a)(ii) and (b) to pay that Seller's Respective
                    Proportion of the amount by which the Required Payment is
                    greater than the Retention Amount.

            (b) (Escrow)

                Where the Seller Representative receives a payment from
                the Escrow Account under clause 5.21 or 5.22 or otherwise, it
                must pay to each Seller in immediately available funds its
                entitlement having regard to any Agreed Claims for that Seller
                being met from that Seller's proportion of the Escrow Amount,
                within 5 Business Days of receipt of the payment from the Escrow
                Account.

            (c) (Transaction costs)

                (i) The Seller Representative may retain from the payment to the
                    Sellers under clause 5.1(a)(i) or any payment under clause
                    3.5 an amount of $26 million ("Estimated Transaction Costs
                    Amount") for a reasonable period to enable payment of
                    transaction costs and fees incurred or likely to be incurred

                    Tech Pacific Limited and costs expressly for the Seller's
                    account under this agreement ("Transaction Costs"). The
                    Seller Representative must do this on a basis that does not
                    discriminate amongst Sellers.

               (ii) The Seller Representative may pay Transaction Costs from
                    the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount as they are rendered
                    or incurred.

                    pay the excess to the Sellers in immediately available
                    funds.

                    paid), the Seller Representative may by notice require each
                    Seller within 5 Business Days to put the Seller

                    Costs.


                                                                              21

                basis set out in paragraph (b) in respect of the Personal
                Warranties and paragraph (c) in respect of the Warranties in
                section 3 of Schedule 5 ("Warranties")) that each Warranty is
                correct and not misleading in any material respect on execution
                of this agreement and will be correct and not misleading as at
                immediately prior to Completion as if made on and as at each of
                those times.


                                                                              24

            (b) In respect of the Personal Warranties, each Seller gives the
                Personal Warranties only in respect of itself and the Shares it

                any other Seller.

            (c) None of the Warranties in section 3 of Schedule 5 are given in
                respect of Tech Pacific, Inc.

8.2         Separate Warranties

            Each Warranty is to be treated as a separate representation and
            warranty. The interpretation of any statement made may not be
            restricted by reference to or inference from any other statement.

8.3         Matters Disclosed

            Each Warranty is to be read down and qualified by any information:

            (a) fairly disclosed to the Buyer by the Seller in the Disclosure
                Letter; or

            (b) contained in this agreement; or

            (c) which is otherwise within the actual knowledge of the Buyer; or

            (d) disclosed in writing to the Buyer during the course of the Due
                Diligence; or

            (e) that would have been disclosed to the Buyer had the Buyer
                conducted searches of the Public Register Information,

            which is or may be inconsistent with that Warranty and, to the
            extent that any Warranty is incorrect or misleading having regard to
            any such information, no amount will be recoverable by the Buyer in
            respect of any breach of that Warranty to the extent that the breach
            arises by reason of or in relation to any such information.

8.4         Buyer's warranties

            The Buyer represents and warrants to the Seller that subject to the
            Warranties:

            (a) in entering into this agreement and in proceeding to Completion,
                the Buyer does not rely on any statement, representation,
                warranty, condition, forecast or other conduct which may have
                been made by or on behalf of the Seller, except the Warranties;

            (b) it has received and understood the contents of the Disclosure
                Letter;

            (c) it has had the opportunity to conduct a due diligence and has
                satisfied itself in relation to matters arising from the Due
                Diligence;

            (d) the Buyer understands and acknowledges the risks and
                uncertainties of the industry in which the Business operates and
                the general economic risks that impact on or could reasonably be
                expected to impact on the Business, its results, operations,
                financial position and prospects; and


                                                                              25
<PAGE>


            (e) irrespective of whether or not the Due Diligence was as full or
                exhaustive as the Buyer would have wished, it has nevertheless
                independently and without the benefit of any inducement,
                representations or warranty (other than the Warranties) from the
                Seller or its agents determined to enter into this agreement.

8.5         Buyer's acknowledgment

            The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that:

            (a) subject to any law to the contrary and except as provided in the

                whether express, implied, written, oral, collateral, statutory
                or otherwise, are excluded, and the Seller disclaims all
                Liability in relation to them, to the maximum extent permitted
                by law; and

            (b) the Buyer agrees not to make and waives any right it may have to
                make any Claim against the Seller or any of its Representatives
                under any of the Corporations Act, the Australian Securities and
                Investments Commission Act 2001, the Corporations Act, the
                Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, the
                Trade Practices Act (including sections 51A and 52), or the
                corresponding provision of any other Commonwealth, state or
                territory enactment of Australia, for any statement or
                representation concerning the Shares or the Company or the
                Subsidiaries.

8.6         Notification

            The Seller must inform the Buyer and the Buyer must inform the
            Seller promptly upon the Seller or the Buyer (as applicable)
            becoming aware of any matter which is or may with the passage of
            time give rise to a Warranty Claim or which otherwise constitutes a
            material breach of any obligation on it under this agreement.

                                                                              32

            Information") does not apply to any such disclosure prior to the
            date of this agreement.

12.10       Enforcement by the Company

            Nothing in this clause 12 ("Confidential Information") prevents the
            Company from enforcing any confidentiality agreement entered into by
            potential buyers of the Shares before the date of this agreement, to
            the extent that the confidentiality agreement was for the benefit of
            and is enforceable by the Company.

            The Buyer agrees to:

            (a) comply with all Privacy Laws;

                (i) by which it is bound; and

               (ii) by which the Seller is bound and notifies the Buyer

            in connection with Personal Information collected, used or disclosed
            in connection with this agreement;

            (b) notify the Seller immediately after it becomes aware that a

                by the Seller to the Buyer to anyone unless the Buyer is
                required to do so under a Privacy Law.

12.12       Application of privacy clause

            Clause 12.11 ("Privacy") prevails over the balance of this clause 12
            ("Confidential Information") to the extent of any inconsistency in
            respect of Personal Information which is also Confidential
            Information.


                                                                              33

            Personal Information which is part of the Business Information, the
            Seller may use and disclose that Personal Information for the
            purpose for which it is required to be retained under this agreement
            or as required by that other law or by any Privacy Laws.

12.14       Use of Business Information by Seller after Completion

            (a) Subject to and from Completion, clause 12.1 ("Confidential
                Information") applies to Business Information as if that
                Business Information had been disclosed by the Buyer as the
                Disclosing Party for the purposes of this clause 12
                ("Confidential Information") and had been received by the Seller
                as the Receiving Party for the purposes of this clause 12
                ("Confidential Information").

            (b) Despite any other provision of this clause 12 ("Confidential
                Information"), each of CVC Capital Partners Asia Pacific LP and
                Asia Investors LLC may disclose reasonable detail of its
                investment in the Group, summary financial performance of the
                Group during the period of its investment, the fact that the
                transactions the subject of this agreement took place and the
                return on its investment in the Group in investor presentations
                and investment fund raising activities as may be reasonably
                required by them or by entities that manage or advise them (or
                Related Bodies Corporate of such managers or advisers) provided
                this is done on a confidential basis.

            (c) Despite any other provision of this clause 12 ("Confidential
                Information"), Hagemeyer Caribbean Holding NV may disclose
                Business Information as is reasonably required by it for
                reporting purposes to any entity that Controls Hagemeyer
                Caribbean Holding NV provided it is done on a confidential
                basis.

12.15       Survival of termination

            This clause 12 ("Confidential Information") survives termination
            of this agreement.

13          Guarantee and Indemnity

13.1        Consideration

            The Guarantor acknowledges that the Seller is acting in reliance on
            the Guarantor incurring obligations and giving rights under this
            clause 13 ("Guarantee and Indemnity").

13.2        Guarantee

            The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
            Seller the Buyer's compliance with the Buyer's obligations in
            connection with this agreement, including each obligation to pay
            money ("Guarantee").

            If the Buyer does not comply with those obligations on time and in
            accordance with this agreement, then the Guarantor agrees to comply
            with


                                                                              34
<PAGE>


            those obligations on demand from the Seller Representative. A demand
            may be made whether or not the Seller Representative has made demand
            on the Buyer.

13.3        Indemnity

            The Guarantor indemnifies the Seller against any Liability or Loss
            arising from, and any costs, charges or expenses it incurs, if an
            obligation is unenforceable against, or a monetary obligation cannot
            be recovered from, the Guarantor under the Guarantee or from the
            Buyer because of any circumstance whatsoever.

            The Guarantor agrees to pay amounts due under this clause on demand
            from the Seller Representative.

            The Seller need not incur expense or make payment before enforcing
            this right of indemnity.

13.4        Extent of guarantee and indemnity

            The Guarantee is a continuing obligation despite any intervening
            payment, settlement or other thing and extends to all of the Buyer's
            obligations in connection with this agreement. The Guarantor waives
            any right it has of first requiring the Seller to commence
            proceedings or enforce any other right against the Buyer or any
            other person before claiming from the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

13.5        No merger

                encumbrance, or other right or remedy to which the Seller is
                entitled; or

            (b) a judgment which the Seller obtains against the Guarantor, the
                Buyer or any other person in connection with this agreement.

            The Seller may still exercise its rights under this Guarantee as
            well as under the judgment, mortgage, charge or other encumbrance or
            the right or remedy.

13.6        Rights of the Seller are protected

            The rights given to the Seller under the Guarantee and the
            Guarantor's Liabilities under it, are not affected by any act or
            omission of the Seller or any other person. For example, those
            rights and Liabilities are not affected by:

            (a) any act or omission:

                (i) varying or replacing this agreement; or

               (ii) releasing the Buyer or giving the Buyer a concession (such
                    as more time to pay); or


                                                                              35
<PAGE>


            (b) acquiescence or delay by the Seller or any other person.

13.7 Guarantor's rights are suspended

            As long as any obligation is required, or may be required, to be
            complied with in connection with this Guarantee, the Guarantor may
            not, without the Seller Representative's consent:

            (a) reduce its Liability under this Guarantee by claiming that it or
                the Buyer or any other person has a right of set-off or
                counterclaim against the Seller; or

            (b) exercise any legal right to claim to be entitled to the benefit
                of another guarantee, indemnity, mortgage, charge or other
                encumbrance given in connection with this agreement or any other
                amount payable under the Guarantee; or

            (c) claim an amount from the Buyer, or another guarantor, under a
                right of indemnity; or

            (d) claim an amount in the liquidation, administration or insolvency
                of the Buyer or of another guarantor of any of the Buyer's
                obligations.

            Under law relating to liquidation, administration, insolvency or the
            protection of creditors, a person may claim that a transaction
            (including a payment) in connection with the Guarantee or this
            agreement is void or voidable. If a claim is made and upheld,
            conceded or compromised, then:

            (a) the Seller is immediately entitled as against the Guarantor to
                the rights in connection with this Guarantee or this agreement
                to which it was entitled immediately before the transaction; and

            (b) on request from the Seller Representative, the Guarantor agrees
                to do anything (including signing any document) to restore to
                the Seller any mortgage, charge or other encumbrance (including
                the Guarantee) held by it from the Guarantor immediately before
                the transaction.

13.9        Costs

            The Guarantor agrees to pay or reimburse the Seller on demand for:

            (a) the Seller's reasonable and documented costs, charges and
                expenses in making, enforcing and doing anything in connection
                with the Guarantee including legal costs, charges and expenses
                on a full indemnity basis; and

            (b) all duties, fees, Taxes and charges which are payable in
                connection with this guarantee and indemnity or a payment or
                receipt or other transaction contemplated by it.


                                                                              36

            (a) to unconditionally release the Officer from all rights and

            to a breach of this deed by the Officer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2           Indemnity

            Subject to clause 3, the Company must indemnify the Officer against

                breach of trust, the court relieves him wholly from such
                liability for the reason that, having regard to the

                believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

                                                                              70

            engagement in the office referred to in Recital A by the Company,

            breach of duty or breach of trust of which the officer may be guilty
            in relation to the Company, and any conduct of the Officer involving
            or relating in any way whatsoever to other shareholders of the

Schedule 7 - Adjustment Statement Accounting Policies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1           General

            set out in Schedule 6 ("Adjustment Statement") and must be prepared:

            (a) in accordance with the specific accounting policies, standards,
                principles, procedures, adjustments and method of application of
                them set out in section 2 of this Schedule;

            (b) to the extent not inconsistent with paragraph (a), in accordance
                with the accounting policies, standards, principles, procedures
                and method of application of them used in preparing the Audited
                Accounts for the six months ended 30 June 2004 consistently
                applied; and

            (c) to the extent not inconsistent with paragraphs (a) or (b), in
                accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2           Specific items

            To the extent that the following transactions and events are not
            already taken into account in the preparation of the Adjustment
            Statement, the following specific adjustments must be made, as
            required, in the preparation of the Adjustment Statement:

            (a) no write off in deferred borrowing costs as reflected in the
                accounts for the period ended 30 June 2004 except on account of
                capitalisation of fresh borrowing costs on new financing
                facilities entered into and routine amortisation of deferred
                borrowing costs over the life of existing financing facilities;

            (b) accrual of liability for break fees estimated at A$1,950,000 (or
                such lesser amount as the Seller Representative may be able to
                agree with the Mezzanine Lenders) to be incurred in relation to
                the early repayment of the mezzanine debt (which amount, for the
                avoidance of doubt, was not included in the calculation of the
                Estimated Net Tangible Assets);

            (c) the Preference Shares must be classified as part of Issued
                Capital; and

            (d) the item "subordinated shareholder loans" estimated at $1.478
                million as at 31 October 2004 must be treated as part of
                Shareholders Equity and it is acknowledged that they represent
                equity entitlements of certain Sellers to be paid out of the
                Purchase Price.

                                                                             102

<PAGE>

            Statement otherwise than as contemplated by this Agreement require
            the agreement of both the Seller Representative and the Buyer.

                                                                             103

            Caribbean Holding NV ("Seller Representative") and [insert full
            name of Buyer] ("Buyer").

 2          Scope

            In accordance with clause 5 of the Share Sale Agreement dated
            [insert date] 2004 between the Seller Representative, the Buyer and
            others ("Agreement"), we have performed an audit of the Adjustment
            Statement (as defined in the Agreement), being a special purpose
            consolidated financial report of the Group as at the Adjustment
            Statement Date (as defined in the Agreement), attached as Annexure
            A. The Adjustment Statement has been prepared by the Group in
            accordance with clauses 5.5 and 5.6 of the Agreement, which requires
            the Adjustment Statement to be prepared in accordance with the
            Adjustment Statement Accounting Policies set out in Schedule 7 to
            the Agreement.

            The directors of Techpac Holdings Limited ("Company") are
            responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Adjustment
            Statement and have determined that the accounting policies used are
            consistent with the Adjustment Statement Accounting Policies set out
            in Schedule 7 to the Agreement. The directors of the Company have
            determined that the accounting policies used are appropriate to meet
            the requirements of the Agreement and are appropriate to meet the
            needs of the users of the Adjustment Statement, being the parties to
            the Agreement. No opinion is expressed as to whether the accounting
            policies used, and described in Schedule 7 to the Agreement, are
            appropriate to meet the needs of the parties to the Agreement.

            The Adjustment Statement and our audit report thereon have been
            prepared solely for the purpose of fulfilling the financial
            reporting requirements set out in the Agreement in relation to the
            proposed sale of the Company to the Buyer. We disclaim any
            assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this audit report
            or on the Adjustment Statement to which it relates to any person
            other than the Seller Representative and the Buyer without our
            express written approval, and we deny any liability to any third
            party not entitled to rely on our report.

            Our audit has been conducted in accordance with Australian GAAS. Our
            procedures included examination, on a test basis, of evidence
            supporting the amounts and other disclosures in the Adjustment
            Statement, and the evaluation of significant accounting estimates.
            These procedures have been undertaken to form an opinion as to
            whether, in all material respects, the Adjustment Statement is
            presented fairly in accordance with the Adjustment Statement
            Accounting Policies set out in Schedule 7 to the Agreement.

            The audit opinion expressed in this report has been formed on the
            above basis.

            Words and expressions defined in the Agreement have the same meaning
            when used in this report.
