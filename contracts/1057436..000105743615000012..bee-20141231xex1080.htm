than the fifth business day after the Closing Date, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement meeting the requirements of the
Securities Act and, unless such Shelf Registration Statement shall become
immediately effective, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC. The Stockholder
shall not be entitled to include any of its Registrable Securities in any
Shelf Registration pursuant to this Agreement unless and until the Stockholder
furnishes to the Company in writing, within 2 (two) business days after receipt of a
request therefor, the Selling Stockholder Information. The Stockholder agrees
to furnish to the Company all Selling Stockholder Information with respect to
the Stockholder necessary to make the Selling Stockholder Information
previously furnished to the Company by the Stockholder not materially
misleading.

(b) Effectiveness Requirement. The Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective under the Securities Act until the earlier of (i) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) such time when the Shares cease to be
Registrable Securities (the "Effectiveness Period").

3.2. Shelf Registration Procedures.

(a) Company Obligations. In accordance with the registration obligations of
the Company under Sections 3.1 hereof, the Company will, as applicable:

(i) file with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement no later than the fifth
business day after the Closing Date and, unless such Shelf Registration
Statement shall become immediately effective, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the SEC;

(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments or post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement as
may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective during the Effectiveness Period (except as otherwise set forth
herein); and cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required
prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
under the Securities Act;

(iii) at least two (2) day prior to the filing of the Shelf Registration
Statement, or any Prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto, furnish a copy
thereof to the Stockholder or its counsel;

(iv) deliver to the Stockholder, without charge, as many copies of the
Prospectus as it may reasonably request (the Company hereby consenting to the
use of each such Prospectus by the Stockholder in connection with the offering
and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus) and a
reasonable number of copies of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-
effective amendments thereto and any supplements to the Prospectus, including
financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by
reference and all exhibits (including those incorporated by reference);

(v) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as the Stockholder reasonably requests and keep such
registration or qualification effective during the Effectiveness Period, and
do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the Stockholder to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not be required (i) to
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this clause, (ii) to subject itself
to taxation in any such jurisdiction, (iii) to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iv) to comply with
requirements under so-called "fair, just and equitable standards" under state
securities laws;

(vi) notify the Stockholder and its counsel (A) when the Shelf Registration
Statement covering such Registrable Securities has become effective and when
any post-effective amendments thereto become effective; (B) of any written
request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and
supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or for
additional information after such Shelf Registration Statement has become
effective; and (C) of the issuance or threatened issuance by the SEC or any
state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
such Shelf Registration Statement or the qualification of the Registrable
Securities in any jurisdiction described in Section 3.2(a)(v) hereof or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;

(vii) file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder
to make available adequate current public information with respect to the
Company meeting the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c)
under the Securities Act, to the extent required to enable the Stockholder to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144;

(viii) notify the Stockholder, at any time that a prospectus covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, of the happening of any event of which it has knowledge and as a result
of which the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement as then
in effect would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing, and, at the request of the Stockholder, the Company will promptly
prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the Stockholder, such prospectus, as so amended or supplemented,
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
the circumstances then existing; provided, however, that at any time, upon
written notice to the Stockholder and for a period not to exceed ninety (90)
days in the aggregate during the Effectiveness Period (the "Suspension
Period"), the Company may suspend the use or effectiveness of a Shelf
Registration Statement (and the Stockholder hereby agrees not to offer or sell
any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement during the
Suspension Period) if the Company reasonably believes that there is or may be
in existence material nonpublic information, developments or events
(including, but not limited to, a pending or contemplated merger or
acquisition, disposition or other material transaction or similar event)
involving the Company, the failure of which to be disclosed in the prospectus
included in the registration statement could constitute a material
misstatement or omission. If so directed by the Company, the Stockholder
registering shares under any registration statement shall (i) not offer to
sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to any such registration statement
during the period in which the delay or suspension is in effect after
receiving notice of such delay or suspension (and, if required, until the
Stockholder receives copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus) and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Company (at the
Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the
Stockholder's possession, of the Prospectus relating to such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company
covenants and agrees that it shall not deliver such notice with respect to the
Suspension Period unless Company employees, officers and directors and any other holders of registration rights
with respect to the Company's Common Stock are also prohibited by the Company
for the duration of such Suspension Period from effecting any public sales of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them, if such holders of
registration rights sell pursuant to a registration statement;

(ix) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.;

(x) cause all securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed and to be qualified for trading on each system on
which similar securities issued by the Company are from time to time
qualified;

(xi) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all securities covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement not later than the effective date of the Shelf
Registration Statement and thereafter maintain such a transfer agent and
registrar;

(xii) take all such other actions as may be reasonably required to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement; and

(xiii) take reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, and upon the
issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration
statement, or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any related
prospectus or suspending the qualification of any securities included in the
Shelf Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of such
order.

(b) Selling Stockholder Obligations. In addition to the other obligations of
the Stockholder contained herein, the Stockholder agrees that the Company may
require the Stockholder to furnish to it the Selling Stockholder Information
and any other information that may be required by the Staff of the SEC to be
included in the applicable Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may
exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities if the Stockholder
fails to furnish such information within two (2) business days after receiving
such request, and the Company shall have no obligation to register under the
Securities Act the Registrable Securities if the Stockholder fails to furnish
such information.

3.3. Registration Expenses. The Company will pay the Registration Expenses in
connection with the Shelf Registration Statement. All other expenses will be
paid by the Stockholder, including, without limitation, any legal fees and
expenses of their counsel or other advisors and any underwriting discounts and
commissions and taxes of any kind (including without limitation, transfer
taxes) relating to any disposition, sale or transfer of Registrable
Securities. The term "Registration Expenses" means any and all expenses
incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement,
including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and
expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, printing expenses,
messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and expenses of counsel for the
Company.

3.4. Indemnification; Contribution.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. In connection with any Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full
extent permitted by law, the Stockholder, its officers, directors, members, and employees and each Person
who controls the Stockholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several,
together with reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees), to which such indemnified party may become subject under the Securities
Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of, are based upon, are caused by, or result from (i) any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained (A) in any such
registration statement, prospectus, or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or (B) in any application or other document or
communication (in this Section 3.4 collectively called an "application")
executed by or on behalf of the Company or based upon written information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to
qualify any securities covered by such registration statement under the "blue
sky" or securities laws thereof, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in light of the circumstances under which they were made
in the case of any prospectus) not misleading, or (iii) any violation or
alleged violation by the Company in connection with any offering under this
Agreement of the federal securities laws, any applicable state law or any rule
or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any
applicable state securities law, and the Company will reimburse the
Stockholder and each such director, officer, member and employee for any legal
or any other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, liability, action, or proceeding; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in
respect thereof), or expense arises out of, is based upon, is caused by, or
results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or
alleged omission, made in such registration statement, any such prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any
application, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information
prepared and furnished to the Company by the Stockholder or other indemnified
party expressly for use therein or by the Stockholder's failure to deliver a
copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto after the Company has furnished the Stockholder with a
sufficient number of copies of the same; provided, further, that the
indemnification required by this Section 3.4(a) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if
such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) Indemnification by the Stockholder. In connection with any Shelf
Registration Statement, the Stockholder will furnish to the Company in writing
such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in
connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the full
extent permitted by law, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and
each of its directors, officers, agents retained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, employees, and each other Person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, together with
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), to which
such indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions
or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of, are based upon, are caused by, or result from (i) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or in any application, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in light of the circumstances under which they were made
in the case of any prospectus) not misleading, but only to the extent that
such untrue statement or omission is made in such registration statement, any
such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information prepared and furnished to the Company by the Stockholder
expressly for use therein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Selling
Stockholder Information), or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Stockholder in connection with
any offering under this Agreement of the federal securities laws, any
applicable state law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable state securities law;
provided, however, that the liability of the Stockholder under this Section
3.4(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds (before expenses) received by it
from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration
statement.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this Section 3.4 of notice of the commencement of any
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for
which such indemnified party may make a claim under this Section 3.4, such
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of
the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel retained by the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. The failure to deliver written notice
to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement
of any such action, if it prejudices or results in forfeiture of rights or
defenses, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 3.4, to the extent of any damage directly
suffered by the indemnifying party as a result thereof. Any fees and expenses
incurred by the indemnified party (including any fees and expenses incurred in
connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or
proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty
(30) days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party. Any such
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified
party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the
defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any
such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified
party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party
notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding
on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or
proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or
proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of more than one additional firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local
counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party
shall be liable to an indemnified party for any settlement of any action,
proceeding or claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification required by this Section 3.4 from the
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this
Section 3.4:

(i) The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action has been committed by, or relates
to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties,
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 3.4(a) and Section 3.4(b), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of
the Stockholder under this Section 3.4(d) shall be limited to the net proceeds
(before expenses) received by it from the sale of securities pursuant to the
applicable registration statement.

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 3.4(d)(i). No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e) Full Indemnification. If indemnification is available under this Section
3.4, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the
full extent provided in this Section 3.4 without regard to the relative fault
of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration referred to in Section 3.4(d)(i) hereof.

(f) Survival. The obligations of the Company and the Stockholder under this
Section 3.4 shall survive the completion of any offering of securities
pursuant to a registration statement under this Agreement, and otherwise.
