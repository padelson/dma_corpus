of money exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable usury laws. If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Note, at the time performance of such provision is due, involves transcending the limit of
validity prescribed by law that a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then the obligation to be fulfilled will be reduced to the limit of such validity. Furthermore, if, from any circumstances whatsoever, the Company ever
receives as interest an amount that would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount which would be excessive interest will be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance due hereunder and not to the payment of interest. This provision
