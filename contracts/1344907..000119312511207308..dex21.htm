2 AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER; THE RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS AND THE MERGER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall commence, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the
Offer to purchase all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The
consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept for
payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject
to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date (A) that number of Shares which, together with
the Contributed Shares and any other Shares then subject to the Contribution
Agreement and the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or
any of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the
Purchaser, or with respect to which Parent or any of its wholly-owned direct
or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, otherwise has, directly or
indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares
then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less than a
majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company
then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote
upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, and (B) that
number of Shares which represents at least a majority of the Shares then
issued and outstanding, excluding from such calculation (x) the Contributed
Shares and any other Shares then subject to the Contribution Agreement, (y)
other Shares then owned of record or beneficially by any executive officer
(within the meaning of Section 16 under the Exchange Act) of the Company (
_provided_ , that any Shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by
the stockholder party to the Contribution Agreement pursuant to that certain
Voting Agreement dated September 30, 2005, by and between the Investor and the
Robert L. Johander Revocable Trust u/a/d December 18, 2006, as amended or
extended from time to time, shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by
such stockholder for purposes of this calculation), and (z) any Shares then
beneficially owned by Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries,
including the Purchaser (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii)
the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The conditions and requirements to the
Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are for the sole benefit of the Purchaser and
may be asserted by the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to such condition and, other than the Minimum Condition and the Governmental
Approval Condition, may be waived by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, subject to this
_Section 1.1_.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the Governmental
Approval Condition, and the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser, of the
other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser shall
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Purchaser is legally
permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in

 



3  respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer shall be promptly paid to the seller in cash, without interest,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing (by action of the Company Board upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee), the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price,
(ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the
maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive
the Minimum Condition or the Governmental Approval Condition, (v) amend any of
the other conditions or requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ in a
manner adverse to the holders of Shares or (vi) add any additional conditions
or requirements (other than procedural and other customary requirements for
tendering Shares) to the Offer that are not expressly set forth in _Annex I_.

 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is the later
of: (i) twenty-one (21) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer
and (ii) three (3) Business Days following the Solicitation Period End Date
(such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, such
later date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ ").

(e) If on or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day following the Solicitation
Period End Date, the Company has delivered a notice of Exempted Person in
accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
successive periods of at least three (3) Business Days each until 5:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the Business Day immediately following the Cut-Off
Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to
extend the Offer if on or prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date all
Competing Proposals by Exempted Persons have expired by their terms or been
withdrawn or terminated. If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date,
all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the
other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) have not been
satisfied, or if permitted by _Section 1.1(c)_, waived by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by the
Purchaser in its sole discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not, and shall
not be required to, extend the Offer (i) beyond November 15, 2011 (the "
_Initial Outside Date_ "), or (ii) if, on the Initial Outside Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied, or waived by the Purchaser,
other than the Minimum Condition and either or both of the Governmental
Approval Condition or the condition to the Offer set forth in clause
(c)(ii)(z) of _Annex I_ , beyond December 31, 2011 (the " _Extended Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to
extend the Offer (but may elect to do so in its sole discretion) beyond the
Business 

 



4  Day immediately following the Cut-Off Date, if the Company has delivered a
notice of Exempted Person in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_, unless the
Company Board has rejected the Competing Proposal giving rise to such notice
and reconfirmed the Company Board Recommendation, which rejection of such
Competing Proposal and reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation has
been publicly announced by the Company. In addition, the Purchaser shall
extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff.

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form Threshold
(without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up Option), the Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the
Purchaser shall immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that
are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering
period". The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a
"subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this
_Section 1.1(f)_ and Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 7_ , the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any
event within seventy-two (72) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of
Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall not accept any Shares pursuant to the
Offer and shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on
behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, the
Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Purchaser may, but shall not be required to,
provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of Shares in the Offer.
The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The
Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any information included or incorporated
by reference in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company
agrees to notify the Purchaser in writing if and to the extent that the
Company becomes aware that any information provided to the Purchaser by the
Company expressly for use in the Offer Documents becomes false or misleading
in any material respect.

 



5  The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the
SEC, and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In
addition, the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
any such written responses and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to
the additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to,
contemporaneous with the commencement of the Offer (and, in any case, the
Company shall as soon as practicable following the commencement of the
Offer), in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
5.4(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also

this Agreement (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the 

 



7  Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by the
Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, together with the
Contributed Shares, bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.
After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon the PurchaserÂ’s request,

Board) and/or using its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly secure
the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and shall cause
the PurchaserÂ’s designees to be so elected or designated at such time. After
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon the PurchaserÂ’s request,

Board to serve on and constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in

Time, the Company shall also, to the extent permitted by the NASDAQ rules and
upon the PurchaserÂ’s request, take all action necessary to elect to be

matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this  _Section 1.4_, including mailing to stockholders
(together with the Schedule 14D-9) any information required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 to enable the PurchaserÂ’s designees to be elected or designated

1.4_. The Purchaser shall supply or cause to be supplied to the Company any
information with respect to U.S. Parent or the Purchaser, and their respective
officers, directors and affiliates, and the proposed designees to the Company
Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. To the extent the Company
shall be required to make a separate mailing to stockholders pursuant to this
_Section 1.4(b)_, the Purchaser shall pay or reimburse the Company for any
and all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred to comply with
this _Section 1.4(b)_.

(c) After the PurchaserÂ’s designees are elected or designated to, and
constitute a majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, and
prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall include at least three
(3) directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each of
whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15)
and eligible to serve on each of the CompanyÂ’s audit committee and
compensation committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ rules and, at least
one of

 



8  whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing
Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is
unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall, if
necessary, take all action reasonably necessary (including creating a
committee of the Company Board) so that the remaining Continuing Director or
Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person
that satisfies the foregoing independence requirements to fill such vacancy,
and such Person so elected or designated shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. After the PurchaserÂ’s designees are
elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of, the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, in addition
to any approvals of the Company Board or the stockholders of the Company as
may be required by the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law,
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required (i) for the Company to terminate or amend this Agreement, (ii)
for the Company to exercise or waive any of the CompanyÂ’s rights, benefits or
remedies under this Agreement, (iii) to permit the Company to, or cause
or permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, enter into any Related Party
Transaction, and (iv) to take any other action of the Company Board under or
in connection with this Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall have, and
the Purchaser and the Company Board shall take all necessary action to cause
the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which
may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense
of the Company, as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority
to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of
this Agreement.

class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the approval of this

non-assignable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable from and after
the Acceptance Time only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price an
aggregate number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned of
record by the Purchaser at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1)
share more than

 



11  90% of the Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the
issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and all of the conditions
to the Merger would be satisfied; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event
shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the
CompanyÂ’s then total authorized and unissued Shares. Upon the PurchaserÂ’s
request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
the Purchaser the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser shall pay the Company the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares in cash and the balance of the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be paid

The Promissory Note shall be substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto
and shall be full recourse against the Purchaser, shall be guaranteed by
Parent and U.S. Parent, shall bear interest at the rate of interest per
annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from time to time during
such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise
the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, after the Acceptance Time and
prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the valid
termination of this Agreement.

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a
written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying the aggregate
number of Shares as to which the Top-Up Option is being exercised, the
denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option
Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for
the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the "
_Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-
Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the
number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the
" _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange
for the Top-Up Option Shares in an aggregate amount equal to the purchase
price specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to
be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares. Such certificates shall include any
legends that are required by applicable Law. The Purchaser acknowledges that
the Top-Up Option Shares shall not be registered under the Securities Act,
and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not
involving a public offering. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and
the Top-Up Option Shares are being and shall be acquired by the Purchaser
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

 



12 ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of U.S. Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the
holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned of record by
Parent or any of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including
the Purchaser (including the Contributed Shares), shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
"). At or promptly after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings
from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Purchaser, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders
of Shares.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the
" _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as the Purchaser or
the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting
the

 



13  surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by the Purchaser, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share.
Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.
If, immediately prior to the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time
(or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



14  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official to the extent
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, U.S. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that Parent, U.S. Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, U.S. Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide for the following:

hereof and only to the extent reasonably apparent from the disclosure therein

standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Purchaser copies of the currently effective articles of incorporation of the
Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") and bylaws of the Company (the " _Company
Bylaws_ "), and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent

Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract, Company Permit or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such
violations, consents, breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

applicable to Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements.

 

(c) None of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any Commonly

defined under applicable Canadian federal or provincial pension benefits
standards legislation, is a defined benefit superannuation fund or is
otherwise a defined benefit plan (including, without limitation, any

Benefit Agreement, no Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement provides health,
medical or other welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of
employment and neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
made any written commitment to provide any such benefits.

(d) With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Agreement,
(i) if such Foreign Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Agreement is intended to
qualify for special Tax treatment, such Foreign Benefit Plan or Foreign

(e) Except as provided for by the terms of this Agreement or as disclosed in

payment or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the consummation by the Company of the Restructuring

of this Agreement by the Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the exercise of the Top Up Option or the
consummation by the Company of the Restructuring Transactions or the Merger

employment on or following the Effective Time), will constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

loss or material impairment of any right of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in or to any Intellectual Property Rights.

(c) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. No proceedings, claims, or actions
have been instituted or are pending against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of the Company, are threatened, that
challenge the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
the use or ownership of the Company Intellectual Property, or alleging that
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries are infringing, misappropriating, 

 



28  diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating
the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person. To the knowledge of the
Company, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating the Company Intellectual Property, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has instituted or threatened to institute any proceeding,
claim or action against any Person with respect to the foregoing.

(d) _Maintenance of Intellectual Property_. The Company and each Company

conception or development of any Intellectual Property Rights for the Company
or Company Subsidiaries have entered into valid and binding proprietary
rights agreements with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries assigning or
vesting ownership of all such Intellectual Property Rights in the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, except where the failure to have such rights
agreements would not individually or in the aggregate have or reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No such Person has
asserted, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such Person has, any right,
title, interest or other claim in, or the right to receive any royalties or
other consideration with respect to, any Company Intellectual Property.

(ii) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has adequate procedures,
practices and/or policies in place to maintain trade secrets and/or other

Persons who have had access to any trade secrets and other confidential

code in escrow so that a licensee might obtain access upon the occurrence of
any release condition.

 

(f) _IT Assets_. The computers, Software, servers, workstations, routers,
hubs, switches, circuits, networks, data communications lines, storage
systems and all other information technology equipment used by the Company and
Company Subsidiaries material in the conduct of their business (collectively,

virus, trojan horse, worm or other software routines or hardware components

Company and Company Subsidiaries have in place commercially reasonable
measures, consistent with current industry standards, to protect the

information and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted
thereby) against any unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or
corruption. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have implemented commercially
reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster

contract or otherwise. 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has entered into a

installment sale, a deferred intercompany transaction or a gain recognition
agreement), or a transaction under which previously utilized Tax losses or
credits may be recaptured (including a dual consolidated loss or an excess
loss account), in each case if such gain or income recognition or such loss or
credit recapture, if triggered, would give rise to a Tax liability.

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
affiliates or predecessors by merger or consolidation has within the past two
(2) years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355
of the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as relates to Section

any Company Subsidiary to any asset or to enforce any rights, and in respect

document which is outside the United Kingdom would attract stamp duty if
brought into the United Kingdom.

 

(o) As of June 30, 2011, the Australian Subsidiary had, for Australian tax
purposes, sufficient franking credits to fully frank a dividend in the amount
of AUD30,000,000. All documents and transactions to which the Company (or its

Subsidiary has been occupied at all times. The Australian Subsidiary has not

contravene, any anti-avoidance provisions of any Australia Tax law, including
but not limited to, Part IVA of the Australian Tax Act.

(p) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have properly withheld from all

the applicable Governmental Entities. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries is in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Laws and guidelines related to transfer pricing. There has never been an
acquisition of control of GTN Canada for the purposes of the Canadian Tax Act.
There are no circumstances which exist and would result in, or which would
have existed and resulted in, the application of any of sections 17, 18(4),
78, 80, 80.01, 80.02 or 80.04 of the Canadian Tax Act or any equivalent
provision of the taxation legislation of any province or any other

Canadian property" for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act.

Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the Insurance Policies. Each of
the Insurance Policies is in full force and effect, and all premiums due

coverage, (b) invalidation of any Insurance Policy, (c) refusal of any
coverage, limitation in coverage or rejection of any material claim under any
Insurance Policy, or (d) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums
payable with respect to any Insurance Policy. There is no material claim by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending under any of the Insurance

Insurance Policies. None of the Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse (or
be affected in any other materially adverse manner) by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.20  _Properties and Assets_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have,
and immediately following the Effective Time will continue to have, good and
valid title to their owned assets and properties, or in the case of assets and
properties they lease, license, or have other rights in, good and valid

Property, other than Permitted Liens. The Company or Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Leased Real
Property, except where such lack of possession would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the conduct
of the business as currently conducted by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

(c) The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property are referred
to collectively herein as the " _Real Property_." Each parcel of Owned Real
Property is in material compliance with all existing Laws applicable to such
Real Property. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any proceedings in eminent
domain, expropriation, condemnation or other similar proceedings that

 



33  are pending. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no such proceedings
threatened, affecting any portion of the Real Property and neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of the existence of
any outstanding writ, injunction, decree, order or judgment or of any pending
proceeding, and there is no such writ, injunction, decree, order, judgment or
proceeding threatened, relating to the ownership, lease, use, occupancy or

material respects with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 and Rule 13e-3 of the
Exchange Act, Regulation M-A and any other applicable federal securities Laws

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.5 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, hearing, notice
of violation, investigation, arbitration or demand letter pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or the Purchaser,

4.6 _Information in the Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by
the Purchaser in writing expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement (and any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) will not, at the date mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and at the
time of the meeting of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders to be held in connection
with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.

4.7 _Information in the Offer Documents, and the Schedule 13E-3_. The Offer
Documents and the Schedule 13E-3 (and any amendment thereof or supplement

expressly for inclusion therein. The Offer Documents and the Schedule 13E-3
(and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other
applicable federal securities Laws.

 

4.8 _Commitment Letter_. Parent has delivered to the Company a copy of the
executed commitment letter (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") from GTCR Fund X/A
AIV LP (the " _Guarantor_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed to
invest in and lend to Parent, U.S. Parent and the Purchaser, as applicable,
the amounts set forth therein (the " _GTCR Financing_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date: (i) the Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii) the Commitment Letter,
in the form so delivered, is a legally valid and binding obligation of Parent
and the Purchaser and the other parties thereto (except as such enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,

 



37  reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditorÂ’s rights, and to general equitable
principles); (iii) there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements relating to the GTCR Financing; (iv) no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or the Purchaser under any term or condition of
the Commitment Letter; and (v) neither Parent nor the Purchaser has reason to
believe that it could be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the GTCR
Financing available to Parent or the Purchaser on the terms therein. Subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ and _Article
6_, the aggregate proceeds from the GTCR Financing are sufficient to fund all
of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or the Purchaser for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for
the satisfaction of all of ParentÂ’s and the PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each Share
validly tendered and accepted in the Offer, the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Merger and the payment of all associated costs
and expenses of the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions and the Merger. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent or the
Purchaser, after the date of this Agreement, may solicit and obtain debt
financing commitments arranged by Parent or the Purchaser as an alternative
to, or in substitution of, the GTCR Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such debt financing commitments shall
not reduce the amount required to be funded by Guarantor under the Commitment
Letter in the event such debt financing is not ultimately funded pursuant to
such debt financing commitments.

4.9 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company the Guaranty, dated as of the date hereof, in
respect of ParentÂ’s, U.S. ParentÂ’s and PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a legally valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar Laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity) and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guaranty.

4.10 _Ownership of the Purchaser; No Prior Activities_. The Purchaser was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection
with its incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Purchaser has not and will not prior to the Closing Date
have incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or otherwise,
any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any
type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with
any Person.

 

4.11 _Management Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, other than the
Contribution Agreement and the employment arrangements set forth on _Section
4.11_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, none of Parent or the Purchaser, or
their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates, has entered into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the executive
officers, directors or affiliates of the Company that is currently in effect
or would become effective in the future (upon consummation of the Offer, the

 



38  Restructuring Transactions or the Merger or otherwise) and that would be
required to be disclosed under Item 1005(d) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act.

 

4.12 _Brokers_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.12_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, none of Parent or the Purchaser, nor any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees or affiliates, has
incurred or will incur on behalf of Parent, the Purchaser or any Parent

provisions of any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Competing Proposal; or (C) terminate, amend, release, modify
or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver
or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement
entered into by the Company in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing
Proposal (other than to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith,
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with
its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take any of such actions
under clause (C) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and is necessary to
facilitate a Competing

 



44  Proposal in compliance with this _Section 5.4_), or propose to do any of
the foregoing. No later than two (2) Business Days following the Solicitation
Period End Date, the Company shall notify Parent and the Purchaser in writing
of the identity of each Exempted Person, together with an unredacted copy of
the Competing Proposal submitted by such Exempted Person. Notwithstanding the
commencement of the obligations of the Company under this _Section 5.4(b)_,
from and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company may continue to
engage in the activities described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section
5.4(b)_ with respect to the Competing Proposal submitted by an Exempted
Person on or before the Solicitation Period End Date until 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the earlier of (x) the eighteenth (18th) calendar day
following the Solicitation Period End Date and (y) the date on which such
Competing Proposal expires by its terms, or the Exempted Person has otherwise
terminated or withdrawn such Competing Proposal (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, any amended or revised Competing Proposal submitted by
such Exempted Person shall not be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an
expiration, termination or withdrawal of such previously submitted Competing
Proposal) (such earlier date, the " _Cut-Off Date_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(b)_,
if, at any time after the Solicitation Period End Date and prior to the
Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Competing
Proposal from a Third Party that was not solicited in violation of this
_Section 5.4_, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (iii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee and after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (x)
furnish nonpublic information to the Third Party making such Competing
Proposal and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Third Party
with respect to such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the Third
Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any material
non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
provided or made available to the Third Party shall, to the extent not
previously provided or made available to Parent or the Purchaser, be provided
or made available to Parent or the Purchaser as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after it is
provided or made available to the Third Party. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in this _Section 5.4(c)_, the Company shall notify
Parent and the Purchaser orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish
non-public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as
provided in this _Section 5.4(c)_, together with an unredacted copy of
the Competing Proposal submitted by the Third Party.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof, including the Special Committee,
shall (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Company Board
Recommendation; (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy Statement; or (iii) if a
tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes a Competing Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company (including, for these purposes, by taking no

 



45  position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by the stockholders of the Company, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within
ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof; (iv) publicly approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal
made or received after the date hereof (any of the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 5.4(d)_, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or (v) cause or permit the Company to enter into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board shall be permitted to (x) effect any Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition with respect
to a Superior Proposal or (y) otherwise terminate this Agreement to
concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, subject in each case to compliance with 
_Section 5.4(e)_ and the concurrent payment of any amount owed by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.2_, if the Company Board (A) has received a bona fide
written Competing Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith,
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with
its financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after
having complied with, and giving effect to all the adjustments which may be
offered by Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to, _Section 5.4(e)_ and (B)
determines in good faith, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and
after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under
_Section 5.4(d)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company
has not breached this  _Section 5.4_ in any material respect as relates to
such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and the Purchaser that the Company
intends to take such action, which notice includes an unredacted copy of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of
the Third Party making the Superior Proposal), (iii) during the forty-eight
(48) hour period following ParentÂ’s and the PurchaserÂ’s receipt of the Notice
of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and the Purchaser in good faith (to
the extent Parent and the Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Guaranty so
that this Agreement and the Guaranty (after giving effect to all such
adjustments) would constitute a Superior Proposal (applying such definition
_mutatis mutandis_ ) relative to the Third PartyÂ’s Superior Proposal, and (iv)
following the end of the forty-eight (48) hour period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee and after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, taking
into account any changes to this Agreement and the Guaranty proposed in
writing by Parent and the Purchaser in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that this Agreement and the Guaranty (after giving
effect to all such adjustments) constitutes a Superior Proposal (applying such
definition _mutatis mutandis_ ) relative to the Third PartyÂ’s
Superior Proposal.

(f) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), notify Parent in
the event that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative receives (i) any Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any Company

 



46  Subsidiary other than requests submitted by Persons with whom the Company is
permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations pursuant to this _Section
5.4_ covered by an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or requests for
information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) with the
identity of such Person and a copy of such Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed
description of such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request), including any
modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of any Competing Proposal (including
any material changes to the terms thereof) and shall provide Parent with
copies of all revised written proposals or offers with respect to, and all
draft documentation reflecting material revisions to, such Competing Proposal.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives or
the Special Committee, from (i) taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third
Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act if
the Company Board has determined in good faith, upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee and after consultation with its legal advisors, that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and no such action or
disclosure shall in and of itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure permitted under _Section
5.4(g)(i)_ that is not an express rejection of any applicable
Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation in favor
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.4_ by any of the Company Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.4_) by the Company.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a Third Party
relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-
market-value basis; (B) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation,
equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Third Party of fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value
basis; (C) the purchase or acquisition, in any manner, directly or indirectly,
by any Third Party of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other Equity Interests in
the Company, or (D) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange

 



47  offer that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party beneficially
owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the shares of Company Common Stock or
any other Equity Interests of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal
(except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "60%") made by a
Third Party which was not solicited by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Company Representative and which, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, taking into account the
interests of the constituencies and factors set forth in NRS 78.138(4), and
the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the Competing
Proposal, including any financing contingencies thereof, (A) if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the Offer and the Merger (after giving effect to
all adjustments to the terms thereof which may be offered by Parent (including
pursuant to  _Section 5.4(e)_)).

(iii) " _Exempted Person_ " shall mean any Person or group of Persons (so
long as, in the case of a group of Persons, the members of such group who
were members of such group immediately prior to the Solicitation Period End
Date constitute more than 50% of the equity financing of such group of Persons
at all times following the Solicitation Period End Date, excluding from this
calculation any Contributed Shares held by any Person that becomes part of
such group), from whom the Company or any Company Representative has received
a bona fide written Competing Proposal after the execution of this Agreement
and prior to the Solicitation Period End Date that, on or before the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company Board determines in good faith, upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Competing Proposal has not been
withdrawn and has not expired or been terminated as of the Solicitation
Period End Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.4_ to
the contrary, any Exempted Person shall cease to be an Exempted Person for all
purposes under this Agreement upon the earlier of (x) the Cut-Off Date
and (y) such time as the Competing Proposal made by such Person is withdrawn,
expires or is terminated.

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity,
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, 

 



48  including without limitation the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the
exercise of the Top-Up Option and the Merger, and (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the
Top-Up Option and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any
other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) applicable competition
Laws, if any (with any related fees to be shared equally by the Company and
Parent), and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company and
Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) cooperate with
each other in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9, the Schedule 13E-3, the Proxy Statement and any Other
Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation
of the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings. The Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Third Party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) required
to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions or
the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In
the event that either party shall fail to obtain any Third Party consent
described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.5(b)_, such party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to
result, after the consummation of the Offer or the Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such consent.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental Entity
regarding the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the Top-Up Option or the
Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties
and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection
with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Offer,
the Restructuring Transactions, the

 



49  Top-Up Option, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither party shall be required to provide or disclose any
such information to the other party if such party has reasonably determined
that doing so would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver or loss of
any attorney-client or other similar privilege; _provided_ , that the parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements in a manner intended to
preserve such privilege.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written
consent of Parent, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or
commit to pay, nor shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary be required to
pay (unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company or such Company Subsidiary
for such payment), to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person, and (ii) neither Parent nor
the Purchaser shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

(e) Parent and the Purchaser agree to take (and to cause their affiliates to
take) promptly any and all reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any competition laws
that may be required by any Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction,
so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions and the
Merger, as promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or
disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be divested in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or
lift, any Law, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions or the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any action or event that would
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to) consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except (a) as may be required by Law or
any listing agreement with NASDAQ to which the Company is a party, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in

 



50  advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect to any announcement by the
Company permitted by, and in furtherance of the CompanyÂ’s rights under and in
accordance with,  _Section 5.4_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
promptly following execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall issue a
press release in a form mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent
announcing the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) the Company shall (A) file a current report with the SEC on
Form 8-K attaching such press release and copy of this Agreement as exhibits
and (B) file a pre-commencement communication on Schedule 14D-9 attaching the
press release. Thereafter, the parties hereto agree to consult promptly with
each other prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Offer, the Restructuring Transactions, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, agree to
provide to each other for review a copy of any such press release or
statement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and review, unless required by applicable
Law.

5.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company to the same extent such Persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement, in each case,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any claims,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject
to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the director or officer of the
Company to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced
expenses to Parent and the Surviving Corporation within five (5) Business Days
if it is ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. The
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the directors or officers of the Company shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the
Effective Time.

 

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors and
officers, as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "
_D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s existing policy (copies

 



51  which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which premium the
Company represents and warrants to be approximately $108,700; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such DandO Insurance coverage
exceeds such 300% amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such 300%
amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If requested by the Company, Parent shall arrange to obtain
such prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this  _Section 5.8_ applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_). 

5.9 _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in
connection with the arrangement of any debt financing (the " _Financing_ ") as
may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives shall include, at the
reasonable request of Parent, (a) participation in a reasonable number
of meetings, drafting sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence
sessions, (b) furnishing Parent and the Parent Representatives with the
Required Information, (c) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the
preparation of offering and syndication documents and materials, including
rating agency presentations, road show presentations and similar documents and
materials, in connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials,
collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "), including providing customary
authorization letters related thereto, (d) facilitating the execution and
delivery at the Closing of definitive documents related to the Financing, (e)
facilitating the pledging at or after the Closing of collateral in connection
with the Financing, including executing and delivering any customary
collateral documents and other customary certificates

 



52  and documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters as of Closing, as applicable), and (f) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain customary payoff letters, redemption notices,
releases of liens and instruments of termination or discharge. The Company
hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos in connection with the
Financing, _provided_ , that such logos are used in a manner that is not
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or their marks and on such
other customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.
Parent shall pay, or promptly reimburse the Company, for all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in connection with the CompanyÂ’s
obligations under this _Section 5.9_, including reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and costs incurred in connection with furnishing any Required
Information not currently in the CompanyÂ’s possession (including any special
audit reports or similar information). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any
definitive agreement or incur any other liability or obligation, to the extent
that such liability or obligation in connection with any Financing would
become effective prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall not assume any
liability or responsibility for the use of any of the Required Information in
connection with the Financing and shall not be required to express any view as
to the reasonableness of any assumptions made by the Parent or any of its
affiliates. All such information shall be made available only pursuant to
confidentiality agreements or arrangements that are customary in the context
of the Financing.

 

5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination" or other Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer, the
Restructuring Transactions, the Merger or the Top-Up Option, including the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or the Contribution Agreement or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board
shall, to the extent permitted by such Law, take all action necessary to
render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a "covered
person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Shares or Company
Options pursuant to this Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of _Section 16_. 

5.12 _Employees_.

(a) In addition to, and not in limitation of any requirements under Law,
during the one-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide and shall cause its affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries, to provide to employees of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries who continue in employment with the Surviving
Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, following
the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; 
_provided_ , that no equity-based or

covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an

fulfilled to the extent possible.

provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

parties, _provided_ , that Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their
respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of

the Financing, in each case without the consent of the Company, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, of its
obligations hereunder.

 



72 8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than

upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of

arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the

shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include

Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to Laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Nevada or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Nevada.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Nevada
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in

thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Nevada State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in
such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Nevada State or
Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Nevada State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a 

 



73  final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.12(c).

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof.

through (C) of paragraph (c)(i) above, (y) has the effect of making the Offer,
the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Offer, the Top-Up Option or the Merger,
or (z) would, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Purchaser, require

(iii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Sections

Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such
date, except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific
date or time (which need only be true and correct in all material respects as
of such date or time); (B) the representation and warranty of the Company
contained in the last sentence of _Section_  

 



_Annex I_ -1   _3.7(a)_ of the Merger Agreement shall fail to be true and correct in all
respects, as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date
with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date, except

reasonably be expected to result in a restatement of the Company Financial
Statements or the withdrawal by the CompanyÂ’s independent public accountant
of its audit opinion with respect to the Company Financial Statements; or (C)
any other representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement (without giving effect to any references to any Company Material
Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications and other qualifications based

fail to be true and correct in any respect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement or as of the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if
made on and as of such date, except for representations and warranties that
relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of
such date or time), except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate with all other failures to
be true or correct, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_
, if either the total number of Shares set forth in clause (i) of the first
sentence of _Section 3.2(a)_, or the total number of Shares subject to
outstanding Company Options set forth in the first sentence of _Section
3.2(b)_, in each case as of July 22, 2011, is less than the actual numbers as
of such date by more than an immaterial amount, such representations and
warranties in _Section 3.2_ shall be deemed to fail to be true and correct in
all material respects; 

(iv) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to
perform or to comply with any material agreement or covenant to be performed
or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach or failure
shall not have been cured;

(v) since the date of the Merger Agreement, a Company Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred;

(vi) the Company shall have failed to deliver a certificate of the Company,
executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions
set forth in paragraphs (c)(iii) and (c)(iv) of this _Annex I_ have been
satisfied; or

(vii) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of
the initial paragraph) are for the sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be
asserted by the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any
such conditions and, other than with respect to clauses (a) and (b), may be
waived by the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
in their sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any action of the type set forth in
clauses (c)(i) or (c)(ii) above that relate solely to the Restructuring
Transactions, but which do not otherwise affect the Offer, the Top-Up Option
or the Merger, shall not be deemed to be a failure to satisfy either of
such conditions. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or the Merger Agreement to a
condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if
such condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be
in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of the Purchaser to
extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and

 



_Annex I_ -2  conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by the Purchaser at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

As used in this _Annex I_ , the term " _Required Governmental Approvals_ "
shall mean receipt of all regulatory approvals and consents that may be
required under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 of Australia
and the Australian GovernmentÂ’s Foreign Investment Policy. The capitalized
terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex I_ shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), dated as of August 2, 2011, by and among GTCR Gridlock
Holdings (Cayman), L.P., GTCR Gridlock Holdings, Inc., GTCR Gridlock
Acquisition Sub, Inc. and Global Traffic Network, Inc..

 



_Annex I_ -3 Exhibit A

FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTE

$[Â—].00 

Chicago, IL

[Â—], 2011

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, GTCR Gridlock Acquisition Sub, Inc. (the
" _Purchaser_ "), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTCR
Gridlock Holdings, Inc., promises to pay Global Traffic Network, Inc., a
Nevada corporation (the " _Company_ "), the principal amount of [Â—] Dollars
($[Â—].00) with interest from the date hereof on the unpaid principal
balance hereunder at a rate equal to the rate last quoted by _The Wall Street
Journal_ as the "Prime Rate" in the United States or, if _The Wall Street
Journal_ ceases to quote such rate, the highest per annum interest rate
published by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release
H.15 (519) (Selected Interest Rates) as the "bank prime loan" rate. Interest
shall be compounded monthly, and all computations of interest payable under
this Note shall be made on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days
elapsed.

1\. Subject to Paragraph 3 below, the principal amount under this Promissory
Note (this " _Note_ ") shall be due and payable upon the earlier to occur of
the following dates (the " _Maturity Date_ "): (a) the date which is one (1)
year from the date hereof; and (b) the date on which the indebtedness
hereunder is accelerated as provided for hereunder. On the Maturity Date the
entire remaining unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with any and
all costs and expenses provided for hereunder and accrued and unpaid
interest, shall be due and payable.

2\. Each payment under this Note shall first be credited to the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest, and the remainder shall be credited against
principal. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable without defense, set off
or counterclaim, in lawful money of the United States of America. If a
payment hereunder otherwise would become due and payable on a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding business day, and interest shall be payable thereon during such
extension.

 

3\. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium
or penalty.

 

4\. Upon the occurrence of a default hereunder the Company or any holder
hereof may, at its option, upon written notice to the Purchaser, declare
immediately due and payable the entire principal balance hereof together with
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, plus any other amounts then owing
pursuant to this Note, whereupon the same shall be immediately due and
payable. If the level of interest otherwise chargeable under this Note would
violate any applicable law, it shall, instead, accrue at the highest rate
permitted by law.

5\. No waiver of any of the terms of this Note shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in a writing specifically referring to this Note and signed
by a duly authorized officer of the Company or any holder hereof, and then
only to the extent specifically set forth therein.

6\. If any default occurs in any payment due under this Note, the Purchaser
promises to pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred  by the holder hereof in collecting or attempting to collect the indebtedness
under this Note, whether or not any action or proceeding is commenced. None of
the provisions hereof and none of the holderÂ’s rights or remedies hereunder
on account of any past or future defaults shall be deemed to have been waived
by any indulgence granted by the holder to the Purchaser.

 

7\. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Purchaser hereby waives
presentment, demand, diligence, protest and notice of every kind, and agrees
that it shall remain liable for all amounts due hereunder notwithstanding any
extension of time or change in the terms of payment of this Note granted by
the holder hereof or any delay or failure by the holder hereof to exercise
any rights under this Note.

8\. This Note shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and
shall bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall not assign, sell, transfer or delegate any of
its rights or duties under this Note. The Company shall not assign, sell,
transfer or delegate any of its rights or duties under this Note.

9\. All agreements between the Purchaser and the Company are expressly limited
so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of
advancement of the proceeds hereof, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid
principal balance hereof, or otherwise, will the amount paid or agreed to be
paid to the Company for the use, forbearance or detention of money exceed the
highest lawful rate permissible under applicable usury laws. If, from any
circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Note, at the
time performance of such provision is due, involves transcending the limit
of validity prescribed by law that a court of competent jurisdiction may deem
applicable hereto, then the obligation to be fulfilled will be reduced to the
limit of such validity. Furthermore, if, from any circumstances whatsoever,
the Company ever receives as interest an amount that would exceed the highest
lawful rate, the amount which would be excessive interest will be applied to
the reduction of the unpaid principal balance due hereunder and not to the
payment of interest. This provision controls every other provision of this
Note.

10\. In the event that any one or more provisions of this Note shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the same shall not affect
any other provision of this Note and the remaining provisions of this Note
shall remain in full force and effect.

 

11\. This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
laws provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Purchaser has caused this Note to be duly executed the
day and year first above written.
