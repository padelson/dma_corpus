Seller (and, if such company is to cease to remain a member of the Buyers
Group, the Buyer and the relevant assignee shall procure an assignment or
transfer of the relevant rights under this agreement back to the Buyer prior
to the company ceasing to be a member of the Buyers Group).

 



 

12.2 If there is an assignment or transfer of the Buyers rights under clause
12.1:

 



 

(a) the Seller may discharge its obligations under this agreement to the Buyer
until it receives notice of the assignment;

 



 

(b) the assignee may enforce this agreement as if it were named in this
agreement as the Buyer, but the Buyer shall remain liable for any obligations
under this agreement; and

 



 

(c) the Sellers liability to any assignee in respect of those rights assigned
shall not be greater than if no assignment had taken place.

 



 

(d) [Reserved.]

 



 

13. **COSTS**

 



 

13.1 Except for any Permitted Leakage, unless expressly otherwise provided in
this agreement, each of the parties shall bear its own legal, accountancy and
other costs, charges and expenses connected with the sale and purchase of the
Shares.

 



 

13.2 All stamp duty and direct transfer Tax payable on or in respect of the
transfer of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne solely by the
Buyer. If reasonably requested by the Buyer, the parties shall reasonably
cooperate as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such stamp
duty and direct transfer Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
transfer of the Shares.

 



 

13.3 [Reserved.]

 



 

13.4

 



 

(a) Other than with respect to any Tax referred to in clause 13.2, if
applicable law requires the withholding of any Tax from any amount payable by
the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) under this agreement, then the Buyer (or
its Affiliate) shall withhold and pay such Tax to the appropriate Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law and such amount shall be reduced
as necessary so that, after such withholding, the Buyer is only required to
pay such reduced amount net of any such withholding. If reasonably requested
by the Seller, the parties shall reasonably cooperate as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such Tax that could be required to be
withheld from any such amount payable by the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates)
under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, any liability for Tax (other than any Tax
referred to in clause 13.2 or underlying a Specified Claim) of the Seller as a
result of the entering into or Completion of this Agreement (a " **Seller Tax
Liability** ") shall be borne solely by the Seller. The Seller covenants to
indemnify the Buyer and its respective Affiliates including the Target Group
(each an " **Indemnified Party** ") on demand and on an after Tax basis for
any and all loss, damage, costs, expenses or liabilities in each case whether
directly or indirectly incurred by an Indemnified Party as a result of the
failure by the Seller to pay and discharge any Seller Tax Liability by the due
date therefor.

 



     

 

 



 

14. **EFFECT OF COMPLETION**

 



 

The terms of this agreement (insofar as not performed at Completion and
subject as specifically otherwise provided in this agreement) shall continue
in force after and notwithstanding Completion.

 



 

15. **POST-COMPLETION UNDERTAKINGS**

 



 

15.1 The Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers Group may need access from time
to time after Completion to certain accounting, Tax and other records and
information held by the members of the Target Group for the purpose of:

 



 

(a) filing Tax returns or dealing with the relevant Tax Authority in respect
of such returns;

 



 

(b) complying with applicable laws or regulations; or

 



 

(c) assessing compliance with applicable laws or regulations,

 



 

and, accordingly, the Buyer agrees that it shall, upon being given reasonable
notice by the Seller, exercise its rights (including voting rights) as the
shareholder of the Company and direct its nominees to exercise their votes as
members of the boards of any Target Group Company so as to seek to procure
that the Target Group shall:

 



 

(i) properly retain and maintain such records until the earlier of the date
that is seven years after Completion and such time as the Buyer and Seller
agrees that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary; and

 



 

(ii) allow the Seller and its Advisers and Representatives (at the expense of
the Seller) to:

 



 

(A) inspect, review and make copies of such records and information for and
only to the extent necessary for that purpose; and

 



 

(B) be given reasonable access to any employee, officer, adviser or premises
of any of the Target Group Companies (and within five Business Days of a
request for such reasonable access) during normal working hours.

 



 

15.2 Subject to clause 15.5, the Buyer warrants to the Seller as set forth on
Schedule 1.

 



 

15.3 Subject to clause 15.5, the Buyer agrees that the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not take, from the Completion Date through the end of the
fifth day following the Completion Date, any action (including any tax
election or other change to any 8B Entitys (as defined in Schedule 1) U.S.
tax classification that would be retroactively effective during such period)
that would change the ownership interests (by vote and value) in any of the 8B
Entities or the classification of any such entity for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes.

 



 

15.4 Subject to clause 15.5, the Buyer agrees that the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not take, from the Completion Date through the end of the
fifth day following the Completion Date, any of the following actions in
relation to any Affected Entity:

 



 

(a) any action that would change the ownership interests (by vote or value) in
any of the Affected Entities;

 



 

(b) liquidate, dissolve, recapitalise or wind-up such Affected Entity;

 



     

 

 



 

(c) change any of the following with respect to such Affected Entity: (i) U.S.
Tax classification, (ii) place or jurisdiction of formation, incorporation or
organisation or (iii) legal form of entity; or

 



 

(d) other than in the ordinary course of business, sell, assign, convey,
distribute or otherwise transfer a material portion of the assets of or
interests in such Affected Entity; provided that whether any action or amount
is "material" for purposes of this clause 15.4(d) shall be determined both
individually (with respect to each such Affected Entity) and in the aggregate
(taking into account all such Affected Entities).

 



 

15.5 Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4, the Buyer
shall be deemed not to be in breach of clause 15.2 and the Company and the
Target Group shall not be prohibited from taking any action otherwise
prohibited by clauses 15.3 and 15.4 so long as either:

 



 

(a) (i) with respect to clause 15.2, such breach does not cause any of the
Affected Entities to not be a "controlled foreign corporation" for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes and (ii) in the case of clause 15.3 or 15.4, such
action does not cause any of the Affected Entities to cease to be a
"controlled foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income Tax Purposes, in each
case at Completion and during the five day period thereafter; or

 



 

(b) with respect to any Affected Entity that ceases to be a "controlled
foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income Tax purposes within the five day
period following the Completion Date as a result of such action prohibited by
clause 15.3 or 15.4 or that is not a "controlled foreign corporation" for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes in circumstances giving rise to a breach of clause
15.2, the Buyer agrees that none of the following actions shall be taken
during the tax year (for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) of such Affected
Entity that includes the Completion (for the avoidance of doubt, including
actions that would be retroactively effective during such tax year):

 



 

(i) any action to liquidate, dissolve, recapitalise or wind-up such Affected
Entity;

 



 

(ii) any change to any of the following with respect to such Affected Entity:
(i) U.S. Tax classification, (ii) place or jurisdiction of formation,
incorporation or organisation or (iii) legal form of entity; or

 



 

(iii) other than in the ordinary course of business, any action to sell,
assign, convey, distribute or otherwise transfer a material portion of the
assets of or interests in such Affected Entity; provided that whether any
action or amount is "material" for purposes of this clause 15.5(b)(iii) shall
be determined both individually (with respect to each such Affected Entity)
and in the aggregate (taking into account all such Affected Entities).

 



 

15.6 The Buyer acknowledges that a breach of clauses 15.2 to 15.5 (inclusive)
could cause Parent to lose its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes, and that this loss of partnership status could result in Tax
costs to Parent and could cause a reduction in Parents market capitalisation.

 



 

15.7 The Parties acknowledge and agree that the following provisions shall
apply in relation to any claim by the Seller under or pursuant to the
provisions of clauses 15.2 to 15.5 (inclusive) (a " **Relevant Provision** "
and such a claim a " **Specified Claim** "):

 



 

(a) in calculating the losses suffered by the Seller as a result of a breach
by the Buyer of any Relevant Provision, there shall be taken into account the
losses suffered by

 



     

 

 



 

the Parent as a result of such breach (including, without limitation, all
losses contemplated in clause 15.5 to the extent actually suffered);

 



 

(b) the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer pursuant to all Specified
Claims shall not in any circumstances exceed US$200,000,000;

 



 

(c) the Buyer shall not be liable in respect of any Specified Claim unless
written notice of such claim setting out the full details of the claim
(including the grounds upon which the claim is based and the amount claimed to
be payable in respect thereof) has been given to the Buyer in accordance with
clause 21 and in any event by not later than 5.00 p.m. on the date falling 18
months after the Completion Date (the " **Final Notice Date** ");

 



 

(d) the Seller will take or procure the taking of all such commercially
reasonable steps as are necessary in order to mitigate any Specified Claim;

 



 

(e) until the Final Notice Date or, if a Specified Claim is notified in
accordance with clause (c) above prior to the Final Notice Date, until such
Specified Claim is settled or finally determined, the Buyer agrees that it
shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer all or any portion of the issued
share capital of the Company if such transfer would result in the Buyer
holding, following such transfer, directly or indirectly, less than 15% of the
entire issued share capital of the Company or less than 15% of the assets of
the Target Group as at Completion unless either (i) the proposed transferee
agrees in writing, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, to be
bound to clauses 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6 and 15.7 of this agreement; or
(ii) there is provided to the Seller an alternative guarantee or form of
security from an entity of comparable or greater creditworthiness than the
Buyer in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Seller. Any such transfer in
violation of this clause 15.7(e) shall be null and void.

 



 

16. **FURTHER ASSURANCES**

 



 

Each of the parties shall from time to time upon request from any other party
use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or procure the doing of all acts
and/or execute or procure, insofar as each is reasonably able, the execution
of all such documents and in a form reasonably satisfactory to the party
concerned for the purpose of transferring to the Buyer the Shares and
otherwise giving the other parties the full benefit of this agreement.

 



 

17. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

 



 

17.1 Each party on behalf of itself and as agent for each of its Related
Persons acknowledges and agrees with the other party (each such party acting
on behalf of itself and as agent for each of its Related Persons) that:

 



 

(a) this agreement together with the other Transaction Documents constitute
the entire and only agreement between the parties and their respective Related
Persons relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Documents;

 



 

(b) neither it nor any of its Related Persons has been induced to enter into
any Transaction Document in reliance upon, nor have they been given, any
warranty, representation, statement, assurance, covenant, agreement,
undertaking, indemnity or commitment of any nature whatsoever other than as
are expressly set out in this agreement and, to the extent that any of them
has been, it (acting on behalf of itself and as agent on behalf of each of its
Related Persons) unconditionally and irrevocably waives any claims, rights or
remedies which any of them might otherwise have had in relation thereto; and

 



     

 

 



 

(c) subject to clauses 3.10, 5.5, 10.6 and 25, the only remedies available to
it in respect of the Transaction Documents (and, where appropriate, to its
Related Persons) are damages for breach of contract and, for the avoidance of
doubt, neither it (nor its Related Persons, where appropriate) has any right
to rescind or terminate any Transaction Documents either for breach of
contract or for negligent or innocent misrepresentation or otherwise,

 



 

provided that the provisions of this clause 17 shall not exclude any liability
which any of the parties or, where appropriate, their Related Persons would
otherwise have to any other party or, where appropriate, to any other partys
Related Persons or any right which any of them may have to rescind this
agreement in respect of any statements made fraudulently by any of them prior
to the execution of this agreement or any rights which any of them may have in
respect of fraudulent concealment by any of them.

 



 

17.2 The Buyer agrees and acknowledges, after due and careful consideration,
that:

 



 

(a) it is not entering into this agreement in consequence of or in reliance on
any unlawful communication (as defined in section 30(1) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000) made by the other party or the other partys
Advisers;

 



 

(b) (i) the Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the **"Securities Act"** ), and may not be
offered, sold or otherwise transferred within the United States of America
unless pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act; and (ii) no offer or sale of
the Shares will be made to the public in the United States of America;

 



 

(c) except as expressly provided in this agreement, it is entering into this
agreement solely in reliance on its own commercial assessment and
investigation and advice from its own Advisers; and

 



 

(d) the Seller is entering into this agreement in reliance on the
acknowledgements given in this clause 17.2.

 



 

18. **VARIATIONS**

 



 

This agreement may be varied only by a document signed by or on behalf of each
of the Seller and the Buyer.

 



 

19. **WAIVER**

 



 

19.1 A waiver of any term, provision or condition of, or consent granted
under, this agreement shall be effective only if given in writing and signed
by the waiving or consenting party and then only in the instance and for the
purpose for which it is given.

 



 

19.2 No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege under this agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

 



 

19.3 No breach of any provision of this agreement shall be waived or
discharged except with the express written consent of the Seller and the
Buyer.

If any provision of this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction:

 



     

 

 



 

(a) the validity, legality and enforceability under the law of that
jurisdiction of any other provision; and

 



 

(b) the validity, legality and enforceability under the law of any other

shall not be affected or impaired in any way.

25. **SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE**

 



 

25.1 Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that damages may not be an
adequate remedy for any breach by the Seller or the Buyer of their respective
obligations set out in clauses

 



     

 

 



 

5.2 to 5.4 (inclusive) and Schedule 4, respectively (such partys "
**Completion Obligations** "), and that either party shall be entitled to
seek, to the extent permitted by law, the remedies of injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief (other than rescission) for any
threatened or actual breach of the other partys Completion Obligations and
that no proof of special damages shall be necessary for the enforcement by
either party of its respective rights under this clause 25.1. Nothing in this
clause 25.1 shall be construed, however, as a waiver of any other rights
either party may have.

 



 

25.2 Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that:

 



 

(a) irreparable harm would occur in the event that the Seller or the Buyer
breached its Completion Obligations and that money damages or other legal
remedies, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy for any such
harm. Accordingly, the parties agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of either partys Completion Obligations, the other party
shall be entitled to:

 



 

(i) an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of the Completion Obligations; and

 



 

(ii) specific performance of the terms and provisions of this agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
Completion Obligations,

 



 

upon a breach or threatened breach of the Completion Obligations without (1)
proof of special damages or (2) any requirement to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction; and

 



 

(b) neither party shall raise any objections to the enforceability of this
clause 25.2 or any injunction or order of specific performance entered by the
courts of England and agree that any such order can be enforced by any court
of competent jurisdiction (including the Delaware Court of Chancery in the
United States of America).

 



 

25.3 The Buyer irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in the United States of America for the purposes of
any suit, action or other proceeding to enforce an injunction or order of
specific performance entered by the courts of England.

 



 

 **IN WITNESS** whereof this agreement has been executed on the date first
above written.
