18 ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE INTERESTS:

CLOSING AND MANNER OF PAYMENT 

Section 2.1 _Agreement to Purchase and Sell the Interests_. On the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from the Seller, the Interests, free and
clear of all Liens.

 

Section 2.2 _Time and Manner of Payment of Transaction Price_. At the Closing,
the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Transaction
Price (consisting of adjustments to the Purchase Price as specified in the
definition of " _Transaction Price_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Seller to the Purchaser not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to Closing.

Section 2.3 _Adjustments to the Purchase Price and Related Matters_.

(a) _Preparation of Estimated Statement_. No later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a
statement (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
and with reasonable supporting documentation the calculation of the
Transaction Price, including calculations of (i) the estimated amount of
Cash, (ii) the estimated amount of Working Capital, (iii) the estimated amount
of Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to Closing, (iv) the estimated
amount of Transaction Expenses and (v) the estimated Bonus Accrual Payoff
Adjustment. The Seller shall cause the Estimated Statement to be prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this
Agreement and otherwise applicable to the particular calculation, GAAP on a
basis consistent with the Standards.

(b) _Prepayment of Company Indebtedness_. At the Closing, (i) the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser evidence that (x) the Company has been released
from all Excluded Company Indebtedness and that all Liens securing Excluded
Company Indebtedness and encumbering any of the Companys assets have been
released or (y) all Excluded Company Indebtedness has been repaid by the
Seller and that all Liens securing Excluded Company Indebtedness and
encumbering any of the Companys assets have been released and (ii) the
Purchaser shall provide the Company funds in the amount of the estimated
amount of Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to Closing set forth in
the Estimated Statement and the Company shall repay such Company Indebtedness
and shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser payoff letters in respect
thereof containing an acknowledgment from the applicable lenders that all
amounts owed by the Company to such lender have been paid in full and that
all Liens securing such Company Indebtedness have been released, all of which
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.

(c) _Prepayment of Transaction Expenses_. At the Closing, (i) the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser evidence, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, that (x) the Company has been released from
all Excluded Transaction Expenses or (y) all Excluded Transaction Expenses
have been repaid by the Seller and (ii) the Purchaser shall provide to the
Company funds in the amount of the estimated amount of Transaction Expenses
set forth in the Estimated Statement.

 



19 (d) _Closing Statement Preparation_. Promptly following the Closing, but in
no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and deliver a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail and with
reasonable supporting documentation its calculation of the Transaction Price,
including calculations of (i) the amount of Cash, (ii) the amount of Working
Capital, (iii) the amount of Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to
Closing, (iv) the amount of Transaction Expenses and (v) the amount of the
Bonus Accrual Payoff Adjustment. The Purchaser shall prepare the Closing
Statement in accordance with this Agreement and, to the extent not
inconsistent with this Agreement and otherwise applicable to the particular
calculation, GAAP on a basis consistent with the Standards. If the Purchaser
does not deliver the Closing Statement when required, the Seller may prepare
and deliver a Closing Statement to the Purchaser within one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the Closing, and, in such case, the Purchaser shall
have the Sellers objection rights under _Section 2.3(f)_. If neither the
Purchaser nor the Seller prepares and delivers a Closing Statement as
provided herein, then the Estimated Statement shall be deemed also to be the
final Closing Statement binding on the parties hereto.

(e) _Access to Information_. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser and the
Company shall grant the other parties and their authorized accounting and
legal representatives reasonable access to such work papers and books and
records or other documents and information as the Seller or its
representatives may reasonably request relating to the calculation of the
Transaction Price and shall make appropriate officers reasonably available to
assist the other party or its representatives and respond to questions, in
each case as such other party may reasonably request in connection with its
review of the estimated Closing Statement, the Closing Statement and the
Notice of Dispute.

 

(f) _Notices of Disputes_. The Seller shall have a period of sixty (60) days
after the delivery of the Closing Statement by the Purchaser to give the
Purchaser written notice of any dispute regarding the amounts reflected in the
Closing Statement. If the Seller does not give the Purchaser written notice of
a dispute, the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and
agreed to by the Seller in the form in which it was delivered, and shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any written notice of a dispute
regarding the Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the elements and amounts with which the Seller disagrees (a " _Notice of
Dispute_ ") stating that the Seller believes the Closing Statement contains
mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with this Agreement, or,
to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement and otherwise applicable
to the particular calculation, GAAP on a basis consistent with the Standards.
The Seller shall not challenge the Closing Statement on any other basis, and
the Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to all other elements and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement not specifically disputed. During the
twenty (20) day period following the delivery of a Notice of Dispute, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall make reasonable good faith efforts to attempt
to resolve such dispute and agree in writing upon the final content of the
disputed Closing Statement or to stipulate to such portion thereof with
respect to which there is no dispute.

 



20 (g) _Dispute Resolution_. If the parties cannot resolve or stipulate to all
disputes relating to the Closing Statement within the twenty (20) day period
referenced above, the matters with respect to which no resolution or
stipulation can be reached shall be submitted to and resolved by the
independent accounting firm of KPMG LLP, provided that it has not provided
auditing, consulting or other services to any of the parties hereto during the
three years prior to the date hereof, or if such firm is unable or unwilling
to serve, by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser (the " _Accounting Experts_ "), who
shall act as experts and not as arbitrators. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall each immediately enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Experts and shall instruct the Accounting Experts that the written
determination (which shall contain the underlying reasoning) of the Accounting
Experts with respect to such unresolved disputed items and the accuracy of
the Closing Statement as a result of the resolution of such disputed items
shall be completed and distributed to the Purchaser and the Seller as soon as
practicable after the engagement of the Accounting Experts; _provided_ that
the Purchaser and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Experts to make a determination within thirty (30) days
(or such other time as the Seller and the Purchaser shall agree in writing)
after its engagement. The Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the
Accounting Experts that its determination shall be made in accordance with
this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement and
otherwise applicable to the particular calculation, GAAP on a basis
consistent with the Standards. In no event shall the Accounting Experts
determination of the unresolved disputed items be for an amount outside the
range of the Sellers and the Purchasers disputed amounts. The Purchaser and
the Seller and their respective accountants shall each make readily available
to the Accounting Experts all work papers and books and records relating to
the unresolved disputed items as the Accounting Experts may reasonably request
to perform their function. The decision of the Accounting Experts shall be
final and binding on all parties and the Closing Statement as determined by
the Accounting Experts (including the final amounts of Cash, Transaction
Expenses, Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to Closing and Working
Capital contained therein) shall constitute the final and binding Closing
Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Experts shall be
borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand,
in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items submitted to
the Accounting Experts (as determined by the Accounting Experts) lost by the
Purchaser on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, bears to the
total dollar amount in dispute that is resolved by the Accounting Experts.

(h) _Transaction Price True-Up Payment_. If the Transaction Price, as finally
determined as provided in _Section 2.3(d)_ or _Section 2.3(g)_, as
applicable, is less than the Transaction Price as set forth in the Estimated
Statement, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the amount of any such deficiency within three (3)
Business Days after the final determination of the Transaction Price, to the
account specified by the Purchaser by written notice to the Seller delivered
at least three (3) Business Days in advance. If the Transaction Price, as
finally determined as provided in _Section 2.3(d)_ or _Section 2.3(g)_, as
applicable, exceeds the Transaction Price as set forth in the Estimated
Statement, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the amount of any such excess within three (3)
Business Days after the final determination of the Transaction Price to the
account specified in _Section 2.2_ (or to such other account as the Seller
may indicate by written notice to the Purchaser delivered at least three (3)
Business Days in advance).

 



21 Section 2.4 _Manner of Delivery of the Interests_. At the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser an executed Assignment of Membership
Interests, pursuant to which the Seller will transfer the Interests to the
Purchaser free and clear of all Liens, a form of which is attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Assignment of Membership Interests_ ").

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable Law to be
deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or
withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid.

which the Purchaser is a party or by which the Purchaser or any of its
respective assets is bound or subject or (c)

 



37  contravene any domestic or foreign Law or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award currently in effect, which, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c) above, would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. No consent, approval or authorization
of, or declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person which has not been received or made, is required to be
obtained by the Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party by the
Purchaser or the consummation by the Purchaser of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (a) such filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and
other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and the applicable competition
Laws of other jurisdictions; and (b) any other consents, approvals,
authorizations, filings or notices which, if not made or obtained, would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.4 _Financing_. The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller true,
complete and correct copies of an executed Commitment Letter, dated as of the
date hereof, from Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, UBS
Loan Finance LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital
Markets (the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the lenders
party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes, among other
things, of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Financing Commitment has not been amended or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the existence
or exercise of the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter (as defined
below) shall not constitute an amendment of or modification to the Debt
Financing Commitment), and, as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, the respective commitments contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment have not been withdrawn, reduced or rescinded in any respect.
Except for any fee letter relating to fees and expenses with respect to the
Debt Financing (the " _Fee Letter_ "), as of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment delivered to the Seller pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 5.4_. The Purchaser has fully paid or caused
to be fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or expenses that
are required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitment, and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Financing
Commitment, as delivered to the Seller pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 5.4_, is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser,
each of the lender parties thereto, as the case may be, subject to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment or the Fee Letter or as set forth in any such documents
amended after the date hereof and not in violation of the provisions hereof,
there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full net
amount of the Debt Financing (including any "flex" provisions) under any
agreement relating to the Debt Financing to which the Purchaser is a party
that would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) impair the validity of the
Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing or (iii) materially delay or prevent the Closing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice,

 



38  lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Purchaser or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any other party under the
Debt Financing Commitment. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and performance by the
Seller and the Company of their respective obligations hereunder, upon receipt
of the proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, the Purchaser
will have access at the Closing to sufficient funds to (i) pay the Purchase
Price, and (ii) pay all other amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be
paid by it and to perform its obligations hereunder. 

Section 5.5 _Independent Review; No Reliance_. The Purchaser has conducted its
own independent review and analysis of the Company, and its condition, cash
flow and prospects, including access to properties and premises of the
Company. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser has relied exclusively
upon its own investigation and analysis and the representations and
warranties contained herein, and the Purchaser:

(a) acknowledges and agrees that (i) neither the Company nor the Seller nor
any Person on behalf of the Company or the Seller is making any
representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the Purchaser has not been
induced by, or relied upon any representations, warranties or statements
(written or oral), whether express or implied, made by any Person, that are
not expressly set forth in _Article III_ or in _Article IV_ or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; and

(b) agrees, to the full extent permitted by Law, that except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct, no director, officer, employee, Affiliate (other
than the Seller and the Company), agent or representative of the Company or
the Seller shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the
Purchaser on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state
securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or omitted,
or statements or omissions.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges
that no representations or warranties have been made with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information that may
have been made available to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives, beyond those expressly given in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ of this Agreement.

Section 5.6  _Solvency_. Assuming (w) that immediately prior to the Closing,
and without giving effect to the Debt Financing, the Company meets the
Solvency tests set forth below, (x) the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Purchasers obligation to consummate the Closing, (y) that the
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement are true
in all respects and (z) that the most recent financial forecasts relating to
the Companys business made available to the Purchaser by the Seller or the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement have been prepared in good faith
and on assumptions that were reasonable at the time such forecasts were
prepared, are reasonable as of the date hereof and will continue to be
reasonable as of the Closing, the Company will be Solvent as of the Closing
Date immediately after and giving effect to the Closing. For purposes of
this  _Section 5.6_, " _Solvent_ " or " _Solvency_ " means (i) the Fair

 



39  Value and Present Fair Salable Value of the assets of the Company exceed
their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities; (ii) the
Company does not have Unreasonably Small Capital; and (iii) the Company will
be able to pay its Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as
they mature. The terms "Fair Value", "Present Fair Salable Value", "Stated
Liabilities", "Identified Contingent Liabilities", "Will be able to pay its
Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature", and
"Do not have Unreasonably Small Capital", have the respective meanings given
to such terms in the form of solvency certificate attached as Annex C-II to
the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof.

Section 5.7 _Purchase for Investment_.

(a) The Purchaser is acquiring the Interests solely for investment for its
own account and not with the view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any "distribution" (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities
Act) thereof. The Purchaser understands that the sale of the Interests has
not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign
securities laws by reason of specified exemptions therefrom that depend upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of its investment intent as
expressed herein and as explicitly acknowledged hereby and that under such
laws and applicable regulations such securities may not be resold without
registration under the Securities Act or under applicable state or foreign
law unless an applicable exemption from registration is available.

(b) The Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Purchaser, by reason
of its business and financial experience in business, has such knowledge,
sophistication and experience in business and financial matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the purchase of the Interests,
is able to bear the economic risk of such investment in the Company, and is
able to afford a complete loss of such investment.

COVENANTS

Section 6.1 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws and without in any way limiting the generality

date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the
Seller and the Company, upon reasonable notice, shall afford the Authorized
Representatives of the Purchaser access to such offices, properties, books and
records of the Company relating to the Company and such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the Company as such
Authorized Representatives may reasonably request, and shall allow the
Authorized Representatives to make copies of, such information and
documentation (including Contracts, books and records of the Company), as
the Purchaser may reasonably request with respect to the Company for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of the representations and warranties made
by the Company in _Article IV_ and compliance with the covenants set forth in
this _Article VI_ , and for any other purpose reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, which may include, if reasonably requested, the purpose of planning
the integration of

 



40  the Company into the Purchasers business operations and shall instruct the
employees, counsel and financial advisors of Seller and Sellers Affiliates to
cooperate with the Purchaser in its investigation of the Company; _provided_
that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company;
and _provided_ _further_ that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secret or violate any applicable Laws (including antitrust laws of the United
States) or any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality, (ii) to
disclose any privileged information of the Company in a manner that is
reasonably expected to result in the loss of such privilege, or (iii) to

_provided_ that an Authorized Representative of the Seller is permitted to be
present at any meetings, conferences or calls. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall restrict the Purchaser or its Affiliates from
contacting any suppliers, independent contractors, sales representatives or
customers of the Company on its own in the ordinary course of the Purchasers
or its Affiliates own businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that such contact
shall relate solely to the Purchasers or its Affiliates own businesses and
may not involve any discussions related to the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.2 _Confidentiality_. Information obtained by the Purchaser and its
counsel, accountants, consultants and other authorized representatives
pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011, by and between the

Closing, the Company shall have the right to enforce the rights of the Seller
(or to cause the Seller to enforce its rights) under any confidentiality, non-
solicitation and similar agreements with any Person entered into in connection
with any proposed sale of the Company to the extent that such rights are
related to confidential information of the Company or the solicitation of
employees, sales representatives and other agents of the Company, and Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser copies of any such agreements.

During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending at the earlier of
(x) the Closing Date and (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, except as expressly required under this Agreement or as

and relationships with third

not oblige the Company to make any out-of-pocket payments to such third
parties, customers, suppliers, officers or significant employees). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except (A) as expressly required
under this Agreement, (B) as required by applicable Laws or any Governmental
Entity or (C) as otherwise set forth in _Section 6.3 of the Company

thereof, the Seller, the Company and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each
other in good faith and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_, (ii) the obtaining or making of all
necessary consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or notices with or from
the applicable Governmental Entity, and (iii) the defending of any legal or

challenging this Agreement or seeking to prevent, delay or impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking
to have any or any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree imposed
vacated or reversed.

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the parties
shall file, or cause to be filed by their respective "ultimate parent
entities," with the FTC and the DOJ the notifications and other information
(if any) required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In addition, the Company and the
Purchaser shall promptly proceed to prepare and file with the other
appropriate Governmental Entities such additional requests, responses, reports
or notifications as may be required or, in the opinion of the Purchaser or the
Seller, advisable, in connection with this Agreement. With respect to each of

expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the
prosecution of, such matters including subject to applicable Law, by
permitting counsel for the other to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with any such filing or any
proposed written communication with any Governmental Entity and by providing
counsel for the other with copies of all filings and submissions made by such
party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) materials may be redacted before being so provided (x) to remove (1)

as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to

other federal, state or foreign law or regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of foreign

Laws_ "), the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
reasonable actions as may be required to avoid the filing of or otherwise
resolve such suit so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable. The Purchaser and the Seller will cooperate to determine
strategy, and will coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Entity as
contemplated by this _Section 6.4(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not require the Seller or the
Company to, and the Company and the Seller shall not be required to, take any
action with respect to satisfying any Antitrust Laws which would bind the
Company in the event the Closing does not occur. In addition, the Purchaser,
the Seller and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
the entry of any permanent injunction or other permanent order which has the
effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Termination Date, and in the event that any permanent
or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Purchaser, the Seller and the Company
shall promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (A) the Seller and its Affiliates shall not give any undertakings,
make any commitments or enter into any agreements with any Governmental Entity
that would be binding upon the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the Company, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser and (B) neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to take any action that involves divestiture of an existing business
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the
Company, or to take any action that could reasonably be expected to impair the
overall benefit expected to be realized from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to
hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

Section 6.5 _Use of BSNA Business Marks and Certain IP Matters_.

 

(a) The parties expressly agree that the Purchaser is not purchasing,
acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in the BSNA
Business Marks. From and after the Closing Date, except as permitted in this
_Section 6.5_, neither the Purchaser, the Company nor any of their Affiliates
will have any rights to use the BSNA Business Marks without the prior written
consent of the Seller.

 



45 (b) The Seller hereby grants the Purchaser and the Company a fully paid-
up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to utilize the BSNA

the Companys signage on existing buildings, inventory of labels, containers,
uniforms, vehicles and websites for a period of six (6) months after the
Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 6.5_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller may terminate this
license after the occurrence of any event caused by the Purchaser, the
Company or any Affiliate thereof that has a negative effect on the goodwill
associated with the BSNA Business Marks, provided the Seller has given the
Purchaser written notice of such event and the Purchaser did not, or did not
cause the Company to, remedy the situation within ten (10) days following such
notice.

(c) The Purchaser will use, and shall cause the Company to use, the BSNA
Business Marks only in a manner consistent with how the BSNA Business Marks
are currently being used in connection with the operation of the business of
the Company in the ordinary course, and the Purchaser shall not allow the
quality of the goods or services with which the BSNA Business Marks are used
hereunder to deteriorate so as to have a materially adverse effect on the
goodwill of the BSNA Business Marks.

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Company to be
recorded as the owner of the domain names "metl-span.com" and "metlspan.com"
with the applicable domain name registrars.

Section 6.6 _Officers  Indemnification_.

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, perform in and otherwise give effect
to all rights to indemnification (including rights relating to advancement of
expenses) or exculpation existing in favor of each present and former
director, manager and officer of the Company, determined as of the Closing
Date (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_," and collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnitees_"), with respect to any costs or expenses (including court costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to the same extent that such
Persons are currently indemnified by the Company pursuant to the Companys
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement as in effect
on the date hereof (and advance expenses as incurred at least to the same
extent such DandO Indemnitees are currently indemnified by the Company pursuant
to the Companys certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances in the
event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

 



46 (b) For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall not
amend its organizational documents in any manner so as to modify the
indemnification or exculpation provisions therein in such a manner
inconsistent with this _Section 6.6_ or otherwise adverse to a DandO
Indemnitee. 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and each
Indemnitees heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it
being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.6_ and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification that any such Indemnitee may have by contract
or otherwise. The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this
_Section 6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.6_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification.

(d) In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser and the Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
parties issue such press release or make such public statement (x) if it is
required by law, regulation or the rules of any regulatory authority
(including, without limitation, any recognized stock exchange) or (y) in the
case it is compelled to do so in connection with legal proceedings or
pursuant to a subpoena, order, requirement or an official request issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction or by any administrative, legislative,
regulatory or self regulating authority (including any recognized stock
exchange) or entity towards such party, and (to the extent reasonably
practicable having regard to the disclosing partys obligation to make
disclosure and the nature of the proposed disclosure) the disclosing party
provides advance written notice to the other party of the proposed disclosure
and cooperates in good faith with respect to the timing, manner and content of
the disclosure.

Section 6.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Seller shall in
a timely manner prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Seller Consolidated Returns and pay all Consolidated Taxes. All such Tax
Returns to the extent related to the Company shall be filed consistent with
most recent past practice unless failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to cause any adverse effect (other than a de minimis one) on

 



47  the Company or the Purchaser. Seller shall prepare a pro forma federal
Income Tax Return for the Company on a stand alone basis for the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and shall deliver a copy of such pro forma
Tax Return of the federal Income Tax Seller Consolidated Return for the
taxable period that includes the Closing Date to the Purchaser within twenty
(20) days after the filing of such Seller Consolidated Return.
Seller Consolidated Returns for the taxable period that includes the Closing
Date shall be filed in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (determined using the closing of the books method), with no
election under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties intend that, in conformance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2), any federal income Tax deductions incurred
by the Company on the Closing Date related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the payment of Company Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses) shall be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 

(ii) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns (other
than Seller Consolidated Returns) of the Company for all tax periods that end
on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). For each Pre-
Closing Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date, prior to the
due date (including any applicable extensions) thereof, the Seller shall
deliver a copy of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, together with all supporting
documentation and work papers, to Purchaser for its reasonable review and
comment. The Seller shall provide the Purchaser with such Pre-Closing
Tax Return (fully prepared and completed by the Seller, and revised by the
Seller to incorporate the Purchasers reasonable comments) and the Purchaser
shall cause such Pre-Closing Tax Return to be executed and timely filed with
the appropriate Governmental Entity and provide a copy of such executed and
filed Pre-Closing Tax Return to the Seller.

(iii) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns
(other than Seller Consolidated Returns) of the Company for all Straddle
Periods (" _Straddle Tax Returns_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with most recent past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Laws. Prior to the due date for filing any
such Straddle Tax Return, the Purchaser shall deliver a copy of such Straddle
Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and work papers, to
the Seller for its review and reasonable comment. The Purchaser will cause
such Straddle Tax Return (as revised to incorporate the Sellers reasonable
comments) to be executed and timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Entity and will provide a copy of such executed and filed Straddle Tax Return
to the Seller.

(iv) If one party objects to any item on a Tax Return (other than a Seller
Consolidated Return) prepared by the other party pursuant to _Section
6.8(a)(ii)_ or _Section 6.8(a)(iii)_, it shall, within fifteen days after
delivery of such Tax Return, notify the other party in writing that it so
objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific
factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection is
duly delivered, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. In the event of
any disagreement that cannot be resolved between Purchaser and Seller,
such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of international
reputation mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser (the " _Tax Accountant_
"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final. The fees
and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller. If the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences

 



48  between Seller and Purchaser with respect to such Tax Return at least five
days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by Purchaser and amended to reflect the Tax Accountants resolution.
The preparation and filing of any Tax Return that does not relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control of Purchaser. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Seller understands that the Purchaser may cause
the Company to begin filing sales Tax Returns in the state of Oklahoma and
agrees that any such filing shall not affect the Purchasers right to
indemnification pursuant to _Article X_.

 

(v) In the case of Taxes (other than Consolidated Taxes) that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(A) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Company
ended with (and included) the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period; and

 

(B) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 

(vi) Unless otherwise required by Law, after the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns or
change any Tax elections or accounting methods with respect to the Company
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such amendment or change
would reasonably be expected to have a material cost to the Purchaser or the
Company without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(vii) Unless otherwise required by Law, the Purchaser shall not amend any Pre-
Closing Tax Returns or Straddle Tax Returns without the prior written consent
of the Seller to the extent such amendment would reasonably be expected to
have a material cost to the Seller.

(b) _Books and Records; Cooperation_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any audit, litigation,
examination or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") and claim for
refund, the determination of a Tax liability or a right to refund with respect
to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of
the Company. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the

 



49  provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, Tax Proceeding, Tax refund or Tax determination and making
Employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(c) _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding _Section 10.6_, any Tax Proceeding
relating to a Seller Consolidated Return or Consolidated Taxes or the Oklahoma
sales tax matters described in Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be exclusively controlled by Seller if the resolution of such Tax
Proceeding has no adverse effect (other than a de minimis one) on the Company
or the Purchaser after the Closing or the Seller indemnifies the Company or
the Purchaser against such adverse effect. Any other Tax Proceeding
constituting a Third Party Claim shall be subject to the provisions of
_Section 10.6_.

(d) _Transfer Taxes._ The Purchaser shall be responsible for all state and
local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes and shall cooperate and timely make all filings, returns,
reports, and forms with respect to such Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall execute and deliver to each other at the Closing any appropriate
exemption certificate relating to any available exemption from Transfer
Taxes.

(e) _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ (other than to the
extent such refund results from the carryback of a Tax attribute of the
Company relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period and other than any such refunds
reflected on the Closing Statement as finally determined) shall be for the
account of the Seller to the extent provided in this _Section 6.8(e)_. All
other refunds of Taxes of the Company shall be for the account of the
Purchaser. The amount of any refund of Taxes of the Company for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Purchaser and the Seller in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 6.8(a)(v)_. Each party
shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party
entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this _Section 6.8(e)_ the
amount of such refund within thirty (30) days after such refund is received,
net any costs or expenses or any Taxes incurred by such party or its
Affiliates in procuring such refund. The Purchaser shall make and shall cause
the Company to make elections under Section 172(b)(3) and other relevant
provisions of the Code, and under any comparable provision of any
state, local or foreign tax law in any state, locality or foreign
jurisdiction in which the Company is included in a Seller Consolidated Return,
to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to any net operating
loss, capital loss, or tax credit of the Company in any Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date that could be carried back to a Pre-Closing period of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such item for
which an election cannot be made under applicable Law, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive (and the Seller shall be required to pay to the Seller)
the Tax refund received or Tax benefit that results from such carryback.

 

(f) _Tax Agreements; Powers of Attorney_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall terminate all Tax Agreements to which the Company is a party such that
the Company shall have no obligations thereunder following the Closing. Seller
shall cause any and all existing powers of attorney with respect to Taxes or
Tax Returns to which the Company is a party to be terminated as of the
Closing.

 



50 (g) _Consolidated Return Elections_. Seller shall cause the
Seller Consolidated Group to make and refrain from making (as applicable) Tax
elections (including on a protective basis) so that the Company shall suffer
no reduction in tax basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36.

(h) _No Section 108(i) Election_. The Seller shall not make (and shall
cause the Seller Consolidated Group not to make) any election under Section
108(i) of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign
Law) that applies to any income or deduction realized by the Company prior to
the Closing. 

Section 6.9 _Resignation of Officers_. Unless directed otherwise by the
Purchaser in writing, the Company and the Seller shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to cause all officers of the Company to deliver their
written resignations to the Purchaser to be effective on or before the
Closing.

 

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Purchaser of: (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event of which it has Knowledge that causes or would be reasonably
likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or the Seller
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined
as if such representation or warranty were made at such time and (b) the
failure of the Company or the Seller to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant to be complied with by such party hereunder (a
" _Disclosure Letter Update_ "). No Disclosure Letter Update shall have any
effect for the purposes of indemnification hereunder or, except as provided
below, relieve the Company from any breach or violation of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless the
Purchaser provides the Company with a written termination notice pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ within seven (7) Business Days after the expiration of
any applicable cure period, if any, in respect of a breach described in a
Disclosure Letter Update delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ and which
uncured breach would otherwise give rise to a termination right by Purchaser
under _Section 9.1(d)(i)_, then (a) the Purchaser, in respect of such uncured
breach, shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement
or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 7.3_ and (b) such
breach shall not be deemed to be a breach that would prevent the Company or
the Seller from delivering the certificate referenced in _Section 8.2(b)_ or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_.

 

Section 6.11 _Third-Party (Non-Governmental Entity) Consents_.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall give any notices to third parties (who are not
Governmental Entities) and use, and cause their Subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts (including cooperating to the fullest extent
reasonably practicable with the efforts of the other parties) to obtain any
consents and approvals from such third parties triggered in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (regardless of
whether such consents are conditions to the closing of this Agreement);
_provided_ that the Seller

  



51  shall be required to pay a fee to obtain a Persons consent (if required in
order to obtain such consent) only with respect to Contracts listed in
_Section 7.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_; _provided_ _further_
(subject to the foregoing proviso) that the Seller shall not be required to
pay a fee to a Person in order to obtain such Persons consent or to amend any
existing Contract with such Person or to enter into any new Contract with
such Person in order to obtain such Persons consent.

(b) With respect to any Material Contract for which any consent necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby has
not been obtained prior to the Closing, in the event that the Closing occurs,
(i) the Seller shall, at the Purchasers request, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such consent after the Closing until either such consent
has been obtained or the Seller and the Purchaser mutually agree, in good
faith, that such consent cannot reasonably be obtained and (ii) the Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser with the
same benefits arising under any such Material Contract that is an Assigned
Contract, including performance by the Seller as agent if legally and
commercially feasible, _provided_ that the Purchaser shall provide the Seller
with such access to the premises, books and records and personnel of Purchaser
and the Company as is reasonably necessary to enable the Seller to perform
its obligations under such Assigned Contract, and the Purchaser shall pay or
satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefits to
the extent the Company would have been responsible therefor if such consent
had been obtained prior to the Closing.

Section 6.12 _Inter-Company Transactions_.

 

(a) All BSNA Payables and BSNA Receivables shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force and effect and shall be due and payable in accordance
with the scheduled maturity or payment date therefor.

(b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and
any product warranties between the Company and the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, at or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, terminate or cause to be terminated all contracts, agreements,
licenses, and commitments, between the Company, on the one hand, and the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand,
in existence prior to the Closing Date (including, the Intercompany Loan
Agreement), other than (i) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
(ii) the contracts, agreements, licenses, commitments, arrangements and
understandings listed in _Section 6.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.
Subject to _Section 6.12(a)_, no such terminated contract, agreement,
license, or commitment, (including any provision thereof that purports to
survive termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the
Closing, and all parties thereto shall be released from all obligations
thereunder (except with respect to any product warranties between the Company
and the Seller or any of its Affiliates) effective as of the Closing.

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assign and
transfer each Assigned Contract to the Company, at the Sellers cost, and the
Company shall assume each such Assigned Contract.

 



52 (d) At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to the
Company, at the Purchasers cost, software licenses provided to the Company
pursuant to the Shared Contracts set forth in _Section 6.12(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_, _provided_ that, with respect to the transfer of the
Microsoft licenses set forth in _Section 6.12(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, (i) the Purchaser shall pay (A) the license fee in the amount not to
exceed $41,049.00 and (B) the "software assurance" fee in the amount not to
exceed $86,055.06 to the extent the "software assurance" is transferable to
the Company and (ii) the Seller shall pay any other costs or fees associated
therewith, if any. To the extent that the Seller is unable to complete the
transfers contemplated in this Section 6.12(d) with respect to any Shared
Contract prior to or at Closing, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to complete such transfers as soon as practicable after
the Closing and, in connection therewith, the parties payment obligations as
set forth in this Section 6.12(d) shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 6.13 _Existing Letters of Credit_. The Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company) to be released in full from any letters of credit, surety
bonds, guarantees and other contractual obligations of the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company) set forth on _Section 6.13 of
the Company Disclosure Letter_, effective as of the Closing. The Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to, cooperate
with and to provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with the actions
contemplated by this _Section 6.13_.

Section 6.14 _Other Agreements_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall, on the one hand, and, as applicable, the Seller shall, or shall cause
one or more of its Affiliates to, on the other hand, enter into the following
agreements (together with the Assignment of Membership Interests, the "
_Ancillary Agreements_ "):

(a) a Transition Services Agreement in a form and substance attached as
_Exhibit B_ to this Agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ");

(b) a Supply Agreement to be entered into between Steelscape, Inc. and the
Company, in a form and substance attached as _Exhibit C_ to this Agreement
(the " _SS/MS Supply Agreement_ "); and

(c) a Supply Agreement to be entered into between BlueScope Buildings North
America, Inc. and the Company in a form and substance attached as _Exhibit D_
to this Agreement (the " _MS/BBNA Supply Agreement_ ").

 

Section 6.15 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For those Employees whose terms of employment are governed by one of the
employment agreements described in _Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, the terms of such Employees employment following the Closing Date
until the expiration or renegotiation of such agreements shall be on the terms
provided in such agreements. Except for those Employees whose terms of
employment are governed by one of the employment agreements described on
_Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter_, the Purchaser shall take

 



53  such action as may be necessary so that on and after the Closing and at all
times prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Covered
Employees (as defined below) shall, for so long as their employment with the
Company or any of its Affiliates continues during such period, be provided
employee benefits, plans and programs (including incentive compensation,
deferred compensation, pension, life insurance, welfare, profit
sharing, 401(k), severance, salary continuation and fringe benefits) which,
in the aggregate, are substantially the same as those made available by the
Purchaser to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. For all purposes
of this Agreement, " _Covered Employees_ " shall mean Employees in the active
employ of the Company or on short-term disability leave as of the Closing
Date, but subject to _Section 6.15(b)_, excluding Employees who are on any
other approved leave of absence from the Company as of the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, military leave, leave under the Family Medical
Leave Act or an applicable state or local family and/or medical leave Law, and
long-term disability) (such Employees, the " _Inactive Employees_ "). For
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits provided by
the Purchaser or the Company on and after the Closing, the Covered Employees
will be credited with their years of service with the Company and prior
employers to the extent service with the Company and prior employers is taken
into account under the Employee Plans or any other employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements in which Covered Employees participated prior to
Closing. The eligibility of Covered Employees to participate in any welfare
benefit plan or program of the Purchaser and the Company on and after the
Closing shall not be subject to any eligibility waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements or any exclusions or limitations for any pre-
existing conditions except to the extent such individual was or would have
been subject to such exclusion under similar Employee Plans or any other
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements in which Covered Employees
participated prior to Closing. The Purchaser shall cause each Covered Employee
to be given credit under any welfare benefit plan or program of the Purchaser
or the Company for all amounts paid by such Covered Employee under any
benefit plans or programs offered by the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company prior to the Closing for the plan year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable plan or program maintained by the Purchaser for
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. At the Purchasers request,
the Seller will cause the Company to provide the Purchaser with information
reasonably necessary (including employment records and payroll records) to
permit the Purchaser to give effect to and to comply with this  _Section
6.15(a)_, subject to applicable Law.

(b) Seller shall take all steps necessary such that, from and after the
Closing, Seller or one or more of its Affiliates (other than the Company)
shall bear and be responsible for all liabilities and obligations with respect
to Inactive Employees. An Inactive Employee shall become a Covered
Employee on the first Business Day following the Inactive Employees return
to work from his or her approved leave, _provided_ that (i) such return to
work occurs within the later of (A) six months following the Closing Date
or (B) the end of any reinstatement period required by Law and (ii) the
Inactive Employee presents him or herself for work to the Company within five
Business Days after being released to return to work.

 

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.15(c), from and after the
Closing, Seller shall bear and be responsible for, and shall indemnify the
Company and its Affiliates from and against, all liabilities and obligations
under all employee benefit plans,

 



54  programs or arrangements, that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored
by the Company or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of any current or
former Employee other than the Employee Plans (the " _Parent Plans_ "),
provided that, following the Closing Date, the Company shall, upon receipt of
invoices therefor, promptly reimburse Seller for claims for medical, dental
and vision benefits incurred prior to the Closing Date and not reimbursed to
current or former Employees prior to the Closing Date up to the aggregate
amount of such claims set forth in Working Capital (with such amounts to be
calculated and allocated to the Company in the same manner as
Sellers historical practices prior to the Closing), and (y) subject to
_Section 6.15(f)_, the Company shall bear and be responsible for, and shall
indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates from and against, all liabilities and
obligations under the Employee Plans (except for those liabilities and
obligations under the Parent Plans).

(d) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, upon receipt of one or more
invoices therefor, promptly reimburse the Purchaser for any and all
liabilities and obligations incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates to
Covered Employees who are on short-term disability leave as of the Closing
Date (each, a " _Covered STD Employee_ ") (x) during the continuous period
following the Closing Date that the Covered STD Employee is on short-term
disability leave (including salary continuation and medical claims) and (y)
if applicable, for claims for medical benefits incurred during the COBRA
continuation coverage period commencing at the conclusion of such short-term
disability leave period. Seller shall also indemnify the Purchaser and its
Affiliates from and against all claims for long-term disability benefits by
any Covered STD Employee at the end of the short-term disability leave period.

(e) For a period of ninety-one (91) days (inclusive) following the Closing
Date, the Purchaser and the Company shall not implement any plant closing,
mass layoff or other termination of employees that, either alone or in the
aggregate (with any other termination of employees by the Company prior to the
Closing Date), would create any obligations upon or liabilities for Seller
under the WARN Act or similar applicable laws. Following the Closing Date,
the Purchaser and the Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries hereby
agree to indemnify the Seller and its officers, directors, employees,
consultants, stockholders and Affiliates for, and to hold each of them
harmless from and against, all Damages that any of them may suffer by reason
of or in connection with any claim, proceeding or suit brought against any of
them under the WARN Act, or any similar state law, which relate to actions
taken by the Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates at any time after the Closing (including any discharge or
constructive discharge of any of the employees of the Company with regard to
any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within
any site of employment of the Company).

(f) The Seller shall bear and be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations under any written retention bonus, transaction bonus or similar
arrangement applicable to any Employee whereby payment is triggered by the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the
Sale Success Incentive described in that certain Management Incentive Letter,
dated April 12, 2012 between Karl Hielscher and BSNA, listed as an Employee
Plan on _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter _and shall ensure
that such bonuses are paid in accordance with their terms in effect as of the
Closing Date.

 



55 (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Covered Employee shall
cease active participation and benefit accrual under, and the Company shall
cease to be a contributing sponsor of, and participating employer in, the
Seller 401k Plan. Prior to the Closing, Seller or its Affiliates shall fully
fund, through the Closing, all employee contributions and employer matching
contributions required pursuant to the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan with
respect to Covered Employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause, or cause its Subsidiaries to cause, the Covered Employees to
participate in a defined contribution plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred arrangement which meets
the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Purchaser DC Plan_ ").
The terms of the Purchaser DC Plan shall provide that Covered Employees shall
have the right to make direct rollovers to the applicable Purchaser DC Plan of
their accounts in the Seller 401k Plan, including if the entire account
balance is rolled over, a direct rollover of any notes evidencing loans made
to such Covered Employees with respect to the transferred accounts.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.15_ are solely for the benefit of the
Company, the Seller and the Purchaser, and no current or former Employee or
any other individual shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 6.15_. In no event shall the terms of this
_Section 6.15_ be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee
Plan, any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored
by Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or
limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Company) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan, employment agreement
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date, or (iii) confer upon any current or former Employee,
officer, partner, member, director or consultant, any right to employment or
continued employment or continued service with Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company), preclude the ability of Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) to terminate the employment or
services of any Employee, officer, partner, member, director or consultant
for any reason, or constitute or create an employment agreement with any such
Person.

Section 6.16  _Seller s Access to Information_. From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company to) hold all the books and
records of the Company existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or
dispose of any such books or records for a period of five (5) years from the
Closing, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose of such books and
records, to offer first in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such
destruction or disposal to surrender them to the Seller. During that five
year period, the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company to), during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable notice, make available and provide
the Seller and its representatives (including counsel and independent
auditors) with access to the facilities and properties of the Company and to
all information, files, documents and records (written and computer) that are
not otherwise protected by legal privilege relating to the Company or any of
its business or operations for any and all periods prior to or including the
Closing Date that they may require with respect to any reasonable business
purpose (including any Tax matter) or in connection with any claim, dispute,
action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or
against any person, and shall (and shall cause the Company to) cooperate fully
with the Seller and its representatives (including counsel and independent
auditors) in connection with the foregoing, at the sole cost and expense of
the Seller, including by making tax, accounting and financial personnel and
other appropriate employees and officers of the Company available to the
Seller and its respective representatives (including counsel and independent
auditors), with regard to any reasonable business purpose.

 



56 Section 6.17 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.17(b)_ and  _Section 6.18_), the Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period) to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) no less favorable to the
Purchaser than those described in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee
Letter ( _provided_ that the Purchaser may (A) amend, replace or modify the
Debt Financing Commitment and any related Fee Letter to add or replace
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
and (B) subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.17_,
otherwise amend or modify, grant any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
or replace, the Debt Financing Commitment), including using commercially
reasonable efforts (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period) to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions applicable to the
Purchaser obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment that are within the Purchasers control, (iii) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) no less favorable to
the Purchaser than those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment and
the Fee Letter and (iv) upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
such definitive agreements, consummate the Debt Financing at Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give the Seller
prompt written notice, in any event within forty-eight (48) hours, of any
actual or potential breach, default, expiration, termination or repudiation of
any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document related thereto by
any party thereto of which the Purchaser becomes aware. The Purchaser shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), enter into any amendment
or modification to, or grant any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or
replace, the Debt Financing Commitment if such amendment, modification, waiver
or replacement (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing such
that the aggregate funds that would be available to the Purchaser at the
Closing (taking into account other sources of funds available to the
Purchaser) would not be sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and all
other amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it and to perform
its obligations hereunder, or (y) imposes new or additional conditions, or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions, to the receipt of
the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I)
impede, prevent or materially delay the Closing, (II) make the funding of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) materially less likely to occur, or (III) adversely affect the
ability or likelihood of the Purchaser to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including _Section 6.18_), if any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment and any Fee Letter
(other than due to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt
Financing resulting from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Seller or the Company set forth in this Agreement), the
Purchaser

 



57  shall promptly notify the Seller, in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours, and provide to the Sellers any information reasonably requested by the
Seller related thereto and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount such that the aggregate funds that would be available to the
Purchaser at the Closing will be sufficient to (i) pay the Purchase Price,
and (ii) pay all other amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it
and to perform its obligations hereunder, _provided_ that the Purchaser shall
not be required to arrange for or obtain any such alternative financing on
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are less favorable
to the interests of the Purchaser than the terms contained in the Debt
Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter. The Purchaser shall promptly provide
the Seller with copies of all agreements pursuant to which the same or any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide the Purchaser with any
portion of the Debt Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to
"Debt Financing" shall include the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment as permitted by this _Section 6.17(a)_ to be amended,
modified or replaced, and references to "Debt Financing Commitment," and "Fee
Letter" shall include such documents as permitted by this _Section 6.17(a)_
to be amended, modified or replaced, in each case from and after such
amendment, modification or replacement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this  _Section 6.17_ shall require, and in no event
shall the commercially reasonable efforts of the Purchaser be deemed or
construed to require, the Purchaser to pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter, whether to
secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise.

Section 6.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel, investment

the Purchaser all timely cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchaser in

Closing Date, and, for each fiscal quarter after the date hereof ended at

Company as of the end of such fiscal quarter and the related unaudited

execute any document in connection with this _Section 6.18(a)(iv)_ that would
be effective at any time before the time immediately prior to the Closing;

 



59 (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser

than as of the Closing); and

 

(xi) otherwise cooperating with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and its
Debt Financing Sources for any of the Debt Financing as necessary or
reasonably requested by the Purchaser or its Debt Financing Sources;

_provided_ that (x) nothing in this  _Section 6.18_ shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would require the Seller and the Company to waive
or amend any terms of this Agreement, (y) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation from the Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Seller,

 



60  the Company or their respective Affiliates, or would reasonably be expected
to result in a violation of Law or loss of attorney-client privilege and (z)
no liability or obligation of the Company or any of its respective
Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives, under any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing
shall be effective until the Closing (except to the extent Purchaser has

its obligations under this Agreement by any of the Seller, the Company (prior
to Closing), their Affiliates or their respective Representatives, or (ii)
any information provided prior to the Closing by any of the Seller, the

Closing or promptly following the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 9.1_ (the " _Reimbursement Obligation_ ").

(c) The Company shall or shall cause its Affiliates to supplement any
Required Information pertaining to the Company on a reasonably current basis
to the extent that any such information, to the Knowledge of the Company,
contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material
fact necessary to make such information not materially misleading. The Company
hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and its Affiliates logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or their reputation or
goodwill.

61 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.19_ to the contrary, nothing
contained in this _Section 6.19_ shall prohibit or restrict the Seller or any
of its Affiliates from (A) collectively owning up to an aggregate of five

management of such Competing Person, (B) selling, distributing, installing or
servicing, whether individually or as a part of a bundled set of products, in
any jurisdiction (i) any product manufactured by the Company and sold to

not manufactured by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, (C) engaging in any
business (an " _Existing Business_ ") in which Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company) is engaged as of the date hereof, including any

in, or managing, operating, controlling, or participating in or being
connected with, as a partner, member, stockholder or otherwise, any Existing
Business, (D) acquiring or investing in any Competing Person if the
Competitive Business of such Competing Person accounted for less than fifteen
percent (15%) of the consolidated revenues of such Competing Person in the
fiscal year immediately preceding such acquisition or investment,  _provided_
that, in the event any such Competitive Business was acquired by such
Competing Person subsequent to the beginning of such fiscal year, the
calculation of such consolidated revenues shall be made as if such Competitive
Business had been acquired by such Competing Person on the last day of the
prior fiscal year.

(c) In the event that the Seller, any Person or business listed on _Section
6.19(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ or any division or Subsidiary
thereof or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with, merges into or is sold to any other Person unaffiliated with any party
hereto or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets or
properties to any Person unaffiliated with any party hereto (" _Subsequent
Dispositions_ "), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.19(a)_ shall continue,
following a Subsequent Disposition, to apply to any such Person, business,
division, Subsidiary, assets or properties to the same extent as such
restrictions would have applied prior to such Subsequent Disposition.

(d) The Seller hereby agrees and stipulates, on behalf of itself and each of
its Affiliates, that in any action or claim brought by the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, or in any action or claim brought against the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, involving the provisions of _Section 6.19(a)_, the Seller
hereby waives, and hereby agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any claim
or defense that the non-competition covenants provided in _Section 6.19(a)_
are unenforceable, void or voidable, for any reason, including, but not
limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, illegality, unenforceable restraint of
trade, failure of consideration, illusory contract, mistake or any other
substantive legal defense. Further, the Seller agrees and stipulates that the
provisions of _Section 6.19(a)_ comport with and are in strict compliance
with Section 15.50, _et. seq._ of the Texas Business and Commerce Code.

 

(e) From and after the date hereof and until the second (2nd) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,

or other affiliation with or representation of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or (ii) request, induce, or attempt to influence any employee or
sales representative of the Company to terminate his or her employment with
the Company, or to violate the terms of their Contracts with the Company, if
any, _provided_ , that (I) nothing herein shall prohibit a general employment
solicitation made through newspaper advertisement or other public forum (and
not engaged for the purpose of circumventing such provisions) and (II) nothing
herein shall be construed to prevent the Seller or its Affiliates from
employing any such person (other than the persons set forth in _Section
6.19(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_) who (x) contacts the Seller or any
of its Affiliates on his or her own initiative without any solicitation by or
encouragement from the Seller or its Affiliates or (y) ceases to be employed
by the Company and any of its Affiliates and has not been so employed for at

encouragement from the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(f) From and after the date hereof and until the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, keep confidential any knowledge and information relating
to the Company or any portion of the Competitive Business as conducted by the
Company which: (i) is not publicly available other than as a result of an act
or omission of the Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives; (ii)
gives or may give any competitive advantage to the Company or its successors
with respect to the operation of any Competitive Business; or (iii) if
disclosed, could give any advantage to a competitor of the Company or its
successors, or could otherwise be deleterious to the Companys ownership or
operation of a Competitive Business (each of the foregoing, the "
_Proprietary Information_ ") which the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company) obtained with respect to the Company or its Representatives
unless and to the extent required by the rules or regulations of any
national or international securities exchange or as requested pursuant to a
subpoena, court order, civil investigative demand or similar judicial process
or other oral or written request issued by a court of competent jurisdiction
or by international, national, state or local governmental or regulatory
body; provided, however, that there shall be no time limit on the obligation
of the Seller, its Affiliates and Representatives to maintain the
confidentiality of any and all trade secrets that constitute Proprietary
Information.

(g) In the event that the covenants contained in this  _Section 6.19_ are
more restrictive than permitted by applicable Law, the parties hereto agree
that such covenants shall be enforceable and enforced to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. The Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the remedy
at law for any breach of the requirements of _Section 6.19_ would be
inadequate, and agrees and consents, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates, that, without intending to limit any additional remedies that may
be available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, temporary and permanent
injunctive and other equitable relief may be granted to the Purchaser without
proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy in any proceeding that
may be brought by the Purchaser to enforce any of the provisions of _Section
6.19_.

63  cause its Affiliates not to, seek to change any rights or obligations of the
Company under such insurance, (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, cooperate with the Company in making claims under such insurance and (c)
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly pay over to the
Company any amounts that Seller or any such Affiliate may receive under such
insurance in respect of losses experienced by the Company to the extent such
losses were borne by the Company.

deliver to the Purchaser as promptly as practicable following the end of each

provide reasonable and prompt assistance, at the Purchasers reasonable
request, in the preparation of such pro forma financial statements as are
required to be disclosed by the Purchaser following the Closing pursuant to

Financial Statements and the Subsequent Financial Statements in accordance
with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, _Interim Financial Information_
and (ii) have finalized review of the March 2011 Financial Statements, the

or statements, in the form attached to such letters of credit or otherwise

to each of the financial institutions that issued the General Termination Fee

time) other than Section 7.1(b) with respect to the HSR Act or (B) (I) at
such time, all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing, each of which
conditions is capable of being satisfied at the date of termination of this
Agreement if the Closing were to occur at that time) and (II) as of October
12, 2012 (the "HSR Measurement Date"), all of the conditions set forth in

pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount equal to $10,150,000 (the "
_General Termination Fee_ "), _provided_ _that_ , if the failure to have
satisfied the condition in _Section 7.1(b)_ with respect to the HSR Act, (1)
in the case of clause (A) above, by the Termination Date or (2) in the case
of clause (B) above, by the HSR Measurement Date, was the result of a breach
by Purchaser of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder,
then the Purchaser shall instead pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an
amount equal to $14,500,000 (the " _Maximum Termination Fee_ ", and together
with the General Termination Fee, each a " _Termination Fee_ ");

 

(ii) by the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_, then the Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount equal to the General
Termination Fee, _provided that_ , if (x) on the date the Closing was required
to have occurred pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Debt Financing could have
been funded upon delivery of a drawdown notice by the Purchaser and any
similar mechanical steps necessary under the Debt Financing Commitment for the
funding of the Debt Financing, or (y) the Debt Financing could not be funded
at the date the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to _Section
8.1_ and the failure of such funding was the result of a breach by the
Purchaser of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder, then
the Purchaser shall instead pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount
equal to the Maximum Termination Fee; or

(iii) by the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, and, at such time, all

transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Seller in the notice of termination upon such termination
(it being understood that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay a
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount of a Termination Fee, and without in
any way increasing the amount of a Termination Fee or expanding the
circumstances in which a Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed that a
Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment of
a Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due
and sufficient consideration.

Indemnitees for any individual claim or claims relating to the same set of

Fundamental Representations) until Purchaser Indemnitees have suffered
aggregate Damages arising out of such claim or claims relating to the same set
of facts and circumstances equaling or exceeding $50,000, in which case the
Seller shall be liable for all Damages arising out of such claim or claims
subject to the limitations of this _Section 10.3_; and _provided_ _further_
that all claims for which the Seller is not required to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnitees because the associated Damages do not equal or exceed $50,000
shall also not count towards the Basket.

(b) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
10.2(a)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the representations
and warranties

 



73  contained in _Section 4.11_ or the Fundamental Representations) any Damages

(c) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Damages under
_Section 10.2(e)_ in excess of the lowest cost of corrective action that

Environmental Laws (considered as a whole taking into consideration any
negative impacts such response may have on the operations of the Lewisville,
TX facility).

(d) The aggregate liability of the Seller for Damages of Purchaser
Indemnitees under _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed the amount of the final
Transaction Price.

(e) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the
Seller, the amount of each claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be deemed to

similar payment, in each case, that are actually collected by such Purchaser
Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto after the use of
commercially reasonable efforts.

(f) The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against any Damages arising out of the breach of any of
the representations or warranties made herein unless, within the Survival
Period, Purchaser Indemnitee delivers to the Seller a Notice of Claim pursuant
to  _Section 10.5_ or _Section 10.6_ relating to the breach which gives
rise to such Damages.

 

(g) In the event of any matter giving rise to an indemnity obligation of the

the Transaction Price

 



74  for federal Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include

Purchaser and the Seller causes such payment not to be treated as an
adjustment to or refund of the Transaction Price for federal Tax purposes.

(l) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The
representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller and the Company and
the Purchaser Indemnitees rights to indemnification with respect thereto
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Purchaser (including by any of its Affiliates, and
its and their advisors, consultants or representatives) or by reason of the
fact that the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or its and their advisors,
consultants or representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Purchasers waiver of any condition set forth in _Article VII_.

(m) The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitees
from and against any Damages arising out of any environmental sampling,
testing or investigation of the soil, groundwater, surface water, sediments,
air, or any other environmental media (" _Environmental Tests_ ") by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, or authorized representatives or agents of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, after the Closing on any of the Companys
properties unless the Environmental Tests are conducted (i) to comply with the

in response to a request, claim, demand or investigation by a Governmental
Entity, which request, claim, demand or investigation has not been invited or
deliberately initiated by the Purchaser or any of Purchasers Affiliates,
(iii) in response to a request from a potential buyer or lender in connection
with a possible sale or financing transaction by the Company, (iv) to prevent,
mitigate, respond to, investigate, or otherwise remediate any environmental
conditions that pose or could reasonably be expected to pose, in
the reasonable judgment of Purchaser or its Affiliates, an unacceptable risk
of harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public, the Purchasers and
its Affiliates employees, or the environment, or (v) during the course
of Purchasers business operations arising out of repairs, modifications,
expansion, construction or other activities conducted consistent with normal
business practices.

Effect or similar qualification contained in any representations and
warranties of the Seller or the Company (excluding any such qualification in
clause (b) of Section 4.8 (Absence of Certain Changes), Section 4.11 (Taxes),
the first sentence of clause (a) of Section 4.17 and the Fundamental
Representations) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount
of Damages arising from a breach of any such representations and warranties.

qualification or (y) any materiality or similar qualification that is made in
reference to the Company, the Seller, the business of the Company, the ability
of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the ability of the Company to continue to conduct its business as currently
conducted (but not, in the case of this clause (y), that serves as a
qualification to a listing

 



75  requirement or is part of the phrase "in all material respects") (excluding
any such qualification in clause (b) of Section 4.8 (Absence of Certain
Changes), Section 4.11 (Taxes), the first sentence of clause (a) of Section
4.17 and the Fundamental Representations) shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether any such representations and warranties containing any
qualification of the type described in (x) or (y) in this sentence have been
breached if the Damages arising out of or relating to any individual breach of
any such representation or warranty (without giving effect to any materiality,
Seller Material Adverse Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification) exceeds $2,000,000.

shall be liable only for the amounts in excess of the Basket; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall not be liable to indemnify Seller Indemnitees for any
individual claim or claims relating to the same set of facts and
circumstances pursuant to _Section 10.4(a)(i)_ (except for the Fundamental
Representations) until Seller Indemnitees have suffered aggregate Damages
arising out of such claim or claims relating to the same set of facts and
circumstances equaling or exceeding $50,000, in which case the Purchaser
shall be liable for all Damages arising out of such claim subject to the
limitations of this _Section 10.4_; and _provided_ _further_ that all claims
for which the Purchaser is not required to indemnify Seller Indemnitees
because the associated Damages do not equal or exceed $50,000 shall also not
count towards the Basket.

 



76 (ii) Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under  _Section
10.4(a)(i)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the Fundamental
Representations) any Damages to the extent the aggregate claims under _Section
10.4(a)(i)_ (except for the Fundamental Representations) of
Seller Indemnitees exceed Liability Cap.

(iii) The aggregate liability of the Purchaser for Damages of
Seller Indemnitees under _Section 10.4(a)_ shall not exceed the amount of
the final Transaction Price.

(iv) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the
Purchaser, the amount of each claim by a Seller Indemnitee shall be deemed to
be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 10.4_ shall be limited to, the amount of Damages that remain after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or
other similar payment, in each case, that are actually collected from any
third party with respect thereto after the use of commercially reasonable
efforts.

(v) The Purchaser shall have no obligation to indemnify any Seller
Indemnitees from and against any Damages arising out of the breach of any of
the representations or warranties made herein unless, within the Survival
Period, Seller Indemnitee delivers to the Purchaser a Notice of Claim pursuant
to  _Section 10.5_ or _Section 10.6_ relating to the breach which gives
rise to such Damages.

 

(vi) In the event of any matter giving rise to an indemnity obligation of the
Purchaser pursuant to this  _Section 10.4_, the Seller will take such
measures to mitigate the consequences of the matter as required by applicable
Law.

(vii) In any claim for indemnification hereunder, the Purchaser shall not be
required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for exemplary or punitive damages
unless actually paid to a third party. 

(viii) The Seller shall treat any payments that the Purchaser makes or
receives pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment to or refund of (as
applicable) the Transaction Price for federal Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to the Purchaser and the Seller causes such payment not to
be treated as an adjustment to or refund of the Transaction Price for federal
Tax purposes.

 

Section 10.5 _Non-Third Party Claims Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified
Party claims a right to payment pursuant hereto, such Indemnified Party shall
send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party (a
"Notice of Claim"). Such Notice of Claim shall specify the legal and factual
basis for such claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.4_, as applicable, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being
understood that any Notice of Claim for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period for such representation or warranty.

 



77 Section 10.6 _Third Party Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) Following the receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, the party
receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall promptly (i) notify the
other party of its existence setting forth with reasonable specificity the
facts and circumstances of which such party has received notice and (ii) if
the party giving such notice is an Indemnified Party, specifying the legal
and factual basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification is asserted; _provided_ that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
hereunder with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that,
such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results in (x) the forfeiture
by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (y) actual material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of notice of
a Third Party Claim, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and to be solely responsible
for the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. The Indemnified
Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party
Claim after it notifies the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim prior
to the time that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party of its
election in accordance with the preceding sentence to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party
declines or fails or is not entitled hereunder to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided herein or to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such thirty (30)
day period, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and
control such defense and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Damages in respect
of such Third Party Claim shall include the reasonable and documented fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party as incurred. If
the Indemnified Party in good faith determines that the Third Party Claim
involves an issue or matter which could reasonably have a material adverse
effect on the business or assets of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right at all times to take over and control the defense,
settlement, negotiation or Litigation relating to any such Third Party Claim
at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that if the Indemnified
Party does so take over and control, the Indemnified Party shall not settle
such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(b) In any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is being sought
hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not
assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in
such matter and to retain its own counsel at such partys own expense;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have
been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the
defense of such claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that there may be defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or
(iii) the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the
Indemnified Party in writing,

 



78  with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there is a conflict of
interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel; and _provided_ _further_ that
the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such Third Party
Claim or separate but substantially similar Third Party Claims arising out of
the same general allegations, be required to pay the fees and disbursements
of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction.

(c) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall
at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the other Party reasonably
apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of which it
is maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to
the defense of any such matter.

(d) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No Indemnifying
Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes, as a condition of such
settlement, compromise or consent, a complete and unconditional release of
each Indemnified Party from any and all liability arising out of such claim,
(y) does not contain any finding, admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing, violation of Law, or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party
and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any
manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified
Party or otherwise encumbers any of the assets of the Indemnified Party.

Section 10.7 _Recoveries from Third Persons; Duplicative Recoveries_.

 

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has
indemnified it pursuant hereto, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over
to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom
the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter.

(b) No Indemnified Party may recover Damages from an Indemnifying Party under
this _Article X_ to the extent such recovery would result in duplicative
recovery for the same Damages.

Section 10.8 _Indemnification Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.3_, and except in cases involving
fraud or willful misconduct, the indemnification pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article X_ and _Section 6.8 _shall be the exclusive remedy of the
parties in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement including for any misrepresentation or breach of any representation
or warranty, covenant, agreement or undertaking contained herein or in any
certificate executed and delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof.

 



79 ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such costs and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, HSR
Fees shall be paid by the Purchaser and if the Closing occurs, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced at the Closing in an amount equal to 50% of the HSR Fee
(as provided in the definition of "Transaction Price").

 

Section 11.2 _Extension; Waiver_. The Purchaser (on behalf of itself and after
the Closing, the Company) and the Seller (on behalf itself and prior to the

the obligations or other acts of such other applicable party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (c) waive compliance by such
other applicable party with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. The waiver by any party of a breach of any term or provision
of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach, or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement. No failure or delay by any
party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

Section 11.5 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, (x) with
respect to the provisions of _Section 6.6_, the Persons benefiting from the

or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of each of the other parties, except that
the Purchaser may assign (including by way of pledge), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder (including its rights to seek indemnification hereunder)
to one or more of its Affiliates, _provided_ that any such Affiliate agrees in
writing to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and provisions contained
herein, and that no such assignment referred to in this sentence shall relieve
the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, a
change of control of the Purchaser shall not be deemed an assignment
for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that the parties hereto modify any rights under this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 11.6_ that inure to the benefit of Persons that are not parties
hereto, such Persons shall be subject to such modifications.

Section 11.6 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by the parties hereto in
any and all respects but only in a written instrument executed by all parties.
The obligations of the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller under  _Section

11.11_ (Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial) and _Section 11.13_

modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Debt
Financing Sources unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Debt Financing Sources shall
have consented in writing to such termination or modification.

Section 11.7 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of the signature page of this Agreement by facsimile

as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

Section 11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of laws

Section 11.10 _Disclosure Letters_.

 

(a) Disclosure of any fact or item in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other
Section to which such disclosure is relevant to the extent that the relevance
of such item to such other Section is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item. The inclusion of any specific item in any Section 

 



82  of the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that the items so
included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the
fact of the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes hereof.

 

(b) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment
of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether
any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included
in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement (other
than with respect to any representation, warranty or provision of this
Agreement in which such specification occurs).

Section 11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Delaware and the courts of the United States
for the District of Delaware, and the appellate courts thereof, solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated herein (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any action, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources
arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder or related thereto), and hereby irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action for the interpretation or enforcement
hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto, that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), that such action may not be brought or is
not maintainable in said courts, that such action is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that
this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts,
and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such
action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware state or
federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that delivery of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 11.3_
hereof or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but
not limited to any dispute against the Debt Financing Sources arising out of
or relating to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and the appellate courts thereof).

 



83 (b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS
AGREEMENT (including any such action, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources arising
out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt
Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto) or the negotiation, execution,
administration, performance or enforcement hereof or thereof. Each Party
certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver, (ii) each party understands and has considered the implication of this
waiver, (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily and (iv) each party
has been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this section.

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any
portion thereof had never been contained herein.

 

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance; Limitation of Liability_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Purchaser shall fail to effect the Closing when required by _Section 8.1_
for any or no reason or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform
hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), then, (i) except for the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with
_Section 11.13(b)_, in the event that the Seller shall be entitled to
terminate the Agreement as provided by  _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, _Section
9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(c)(iii) _and receive a Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 9.2(b)_, the Seller and the Companys sole and exclusive pre-
Closing remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any Purchaser Related Party for any breach, loss or damage shall be to
terminate this Agreement as provided, and only to the extent provided, in
_Section 9.1(c)(i)_ ,  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ and to
receive payment of a Termination Fee under and only to the extent provided by
_Section 9.2(b)_; and (ii) following termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section
9.1(c)(iii) _and payment of a Termination Fee as described in the immediately
foregoing clause (i), except for the Reimbursement Obligation set forth in 
_Section 6.18(b)_ and any amount payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_, (x)
none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any liability to the Seller
or the Company, or any of their Affiliates or any other Person relating to or

 



84  arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments or otherwise,
whether at law or equity, in contract or tort or otherwise, and no Person will
have any rights or claims against any of the Purchaser Related Parties
hereunder or thereunder, and (y) the Seller and the Company shall cause any
Proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Proceeding related to the
Debt Financing, Debt Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Commitments) by
any of them or any of their respective Affiliates, and seek to cause any such
Proceeding by any of their respective Affiliates, any of their or their
respective Affiliates former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners or stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") against the Purchaser or any
other Purchaser Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days, after payment of a Termination Fee.
In the event that the Seller shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement as
provided by _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section
9.1(c)(iii) _and receive a Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_,
except for the payment by the Purchaser of a Termination Fee when required
and to the extent set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_ and the Reimbursement
Obligation set forth in _Section 6.18(b)_, (i) none of the Purchaser nor any
other Purchaser Related Party shall have any liability to the Seller or any
Seller Related Party in connection with this Agreement (including in respect
of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) in no event shall any party hereto nor
any Purchaser Related Party be liable for or obligated to pay consequential,
special, multiple, punitive or exemplary damages including, damages arising
from loss of profits, business opportunities or goodwill in respect of any
breach or failure to comply with this Agreement or in respect of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing and the Debt
Financing Commitments), and (iii) in no event shall any Seller Related
Party seek on behalf of any Seller Related Party any damages from, or
otherwise bring any Proceeding against, any Purchaser Related Party in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder (including any Proceeding related to the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing, or the Debt Financing Commitments), other than a Proceeding to
recover payment of a Termination Fee to the extent such Termination Fee is not
paid when due pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or for specific performance,
injunction or other equitable remedy in accordance with this _Section 11.13_.
Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Purchaser Related Parties for any breach of this
agreement or failure to perform hereunder (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), shall in all case be limited to
the amount of the Maximum Termination Fee, plus any amount that may be payable
pursuant to _Section 6.18(b)_. While the Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance, injunction or other equitable remedies under _Section
11.13(b)_ and the payment of a Termination Fee under _Section 9.2(b)_,
under no circumstances shall the Seller Related Parties, taken as a whole, be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
obligation to consummate the Closing and monetary damages in connection with
this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including all or any
portion of a Termination Fee and in no event shall the Purchaser be required
to pay a Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In no event shall any
Seller Related Party be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance
of this Agreement other than in accordance with this _Section 11.13_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event that the General Termination Fee is paid pursuant to  _Section
9.2(b)_, nothing contained in this _Section 11.13(a)_ shall prevent the
Seller from bringing a claim against the Purchaser asserting that Seller is
entitled to receive the Maximum Termination Fee under this Agreement. 

 



85 (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to
this _Section 11.13_, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement,
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, without any bond or other security being required,
such requirement being hereby waived, and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, _provided_ that the Seller shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the Purchasers obligations to consummate the Closing pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement only in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (A) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing,
each of which conditions is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (B)
the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing if all other conditions to
the Closing shall have been satisfied, (C) the Purchaser fails to consummate
the Closing by the time the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section
8.1_, and (D) the Seller shall have given written notice to the Purchaser that
if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, and the
Purchaser otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the Closing
will occur.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section 11.13_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 11.13_ shall in any
way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which the
Purchaser or any other Purchaser Related Party may be liable under this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt
Financing).

 

(d) To the extent any party hereto brings any Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than a Proceeding to specifically enforce any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ hereof)
when such remedy is expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding.

Section 11.14 _Conflicts and Privilege_. The parties agree that in the event
a dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser or the Company, on
the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. shall
not represent the Seller or any of its Affiliates in any such dispute except
with respect to any dispute over the adjustment to the Transaction Price
following the Closing as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_. The parties further
agree that all communications among Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., the Seller and
the Company (other than communications solely between the Seller and Vinson and
Elkins L.L.P.) shall be subject to the joint attorney-client privilege of the
Company and the Seller and the parties agree that any such 

 



86  joint attorney-client privilege shall not prevent Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.
from representing the Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any dispute
over the adjustment to the Transaction Price following the Closing as
provided in _Section 2.3(f)_.

Section 11.15 _Guarantee_. All of the Sellers obligations hereunder are
hereby guaranteed by BSNA. BSNA hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall
cause the Seller to comply with all of the Sellers obligations under this
Agreement (" _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and in the event the Seller fails
to comply with any such obligations, it shall intervene to perform, or cause
to be performed, such obligations in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of
collectibility. BSNA agrees that, for so long as Seller is an affiliate of
BSNA, the Purchaser and the Seller may at any time and from time to time,
without notice to BSNA or BSNAs further consent, extend the term of this
Agreement and make any agreement with the Seller or any Person liable with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder for the extension,
renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in
part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement
between the Purchaser and the Seller or any such other Person without in any
way impairing or affecting any of its Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. BSNA
agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in
whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any of the
Purchaser Related Parties to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against the Seller or any other Person liable with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any change in the time, place or manner
of payment of any Guaranteed Obligations or any rescission, waiver,
compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of
the terms or provisions of the Agreement or any other agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership
of the Seller or any other Person liable with respect to any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (d) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
other similar proceeding affecting the Seller or any other Person liable with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (e) the existence of any right
of set-off which BSNA may have at any time against the Purchaser Related
Parties, whether in connection with any Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
or (f) the adequacy of any other means the Purchaser may have of obtaining
payment of any Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
BSNA hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason
of any Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by any of
the Purchaser Related Parties. BSNA waives promptness, diligence, notice of
the acceptance of this guarantee and of any Guaranteed Obligation,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the incurrence of any Guaranteed Obligations and all
other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of
any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Purchaser or
any other Person liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations and all
suretyship defenses generally. BSNA acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
