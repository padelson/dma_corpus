further, that the matter described on Item 3 on the "Significant Regulatory

a ratio of cash to Class A Common Stock (valued based on the 30-day volume-
weighted average price per share as of the day prior to the date of
determination) equal to the Indemnity Escrow Funding Ratio) in the Indemnity
Escrow Account until the date on which the Purchaser shall reasonably
determine (taking into account the applicable statute of limitations period
with respect to the Specified Matter) that neither the Company nor its
Affiliates will likely have any further liability resulting from an SEC and/or
FINRA enforcement action relating to the Specified Matter and following such
date, the Purchaser and the Seller shall 

deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the Seller the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Funds
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; provided that an amount having a value equal to any then

terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(iv) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the
final determination of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchaser and
the Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Seller an amount equal to
the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE III 

PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS

3.01 Adjustments.

(a) Closing Date Adjustments. At the Closing, the Closing Consideration shall
be adjusted as set forth in this Section 3.01. Not more than seven (7)
Business Days nor less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a statement (the "Allocation
Statement") setting forth its determination of each of the Cash Percentage,
the Stock Percentage, the Adjustment Escrow Cash Amount, the Indemnity Escrow
Cash Amount, the Tax Indemnity Escrow Cash Amount, the Adjustment Escrow
Funding Ratio, the Indemnity Escrow Funding Ratio and the Tax Indemnity Escrow
Funding Ratio.

(b) Not more than five (5) Business Days nor less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth its good faith
determination of each of the Estimated Cash Consideration, the Distributable
Amount, the Tangible Book Value (the "Estimated Tangible Book Value") and the
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"). The Estimated
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, applied on a consistent basis. The Company shall consider in good
faith any of the Purchaser's comments to the Estimated Closing Statement.

(c) Post‑Closing Determination. On the first Business Day following the day
that is 90 calendar days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the
Purchaser's calculation of Tangible 

Book Value and Transaction Expenses, prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, applied on a consistent basis. During the preparation
of the Closing Statement by the Purchaser and the period of any dispute with
respect to the application of this Section 3.01(c), each party hereto shall
cooperate with the other parties hereto to the extent reasonably requested to
prepare the Closing Statement or to investigate the basis for any dispute. The
Closing Statement shall be examined by the Seller, and, if the Seller
disagrees with any items or calculations in the computation of any amounts
shown or reflected in the Closing Statement, the Seller shall, not later than
45 calendar days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver to the
Purchaser a reasonably detailed report thereon (the "Closing Statement
Report"). The Closing Statement Report shall list those items, if any, with
which the Seller disagrees and the Seller's proposed adjustment thereto. If
the Seller fails to deliver to the Purchaser the Closing Statement Report
within 45 calendar days following receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller
shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement for the purposes of any
adjustment to the Closing Consideration under Section 3.01(d). If the Seller
timely delivers the Closing Statement Report to the Purchaser, and if the
Seller and the Purchaser are unable, within 15 calendar days after receipt by
the Purchaser thereof, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such disputed
exceptions will be referred to a firm of independent certified public
accountants (the "Independent Accounting Firm") mutually acceptable to the
Seller and the Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within 30
calendar days following its selection, deliver to the Seller and the Purchaser
a written report determining such disputed exceptions (and only such disputed
exceptions), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties thereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the Estimated Adjusted
Purchase Price under Section 3.01(d). The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm acting under this Section 3.01 shall be allocated
between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based
upon the total monetary value of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each
such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm as the aggregate disputed
exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total monetary value of
all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accounting Firm.

(d) Post‑Closing Adjustments.

(i) If the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a joint written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Purchaser an amount equal to such difference from the
Adjustment Escrow Account, and, if the amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account
is insufficient to satisfy such obligation in full, from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; provided that any amounts
released from the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released in a ratio of
cash to Class A Common Stock (valued based on the 30-day volume-weighted
average price per share as of the day prior to the date of determination)
equal to the Adjustment Escrow Funding Ratio and any amounts released from the
Indemnity Escrow Account shall be released in a ratio of cash to Class A
Common Stock (valued based on the 30-day volume-weighted average price per
share as of the day prior to the date of determination) equal to the 

Indemnity Escrow Funding Ratio. The Purchaser's sole and exclusive source of
recovery for any adjustment under this Section 3.01 shall be against any
remaining Escrow Amounts and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not
have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to this Section 3.01 except to
the extent of amounts available in the Escrow Accounts.

(ii) If the Final Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall (i) make a payment to the Seller
of the Cash Percentage of such excess amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to, or as directed by, the Seller, and (ii) cause to be issued
to the Seller, and/or its designee(s), an amount of Class A Common Stock
(valued based on the 30-day volume-weighted average price per share as of the
day prior to the date of determination) equal to the remaining portion of such
excess amount.

(iii) Promptly following the final determination of the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price, and any payments made pursuant to this Section 3.01(d), if
there are any amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written
instruction directing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller such remaining
amounts.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.01
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

3.02 Withholding. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any and all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement the amounts required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided that, other than with respect to
compensation or backup withholding, Purchaser shall notify the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding would be made in writing of its
intention to deduct and withhold such amounts and the reason therefor at least
five (5) days prior to the date of such withholding and shall cooperate with
such Person in good faith to reduce the amount of, or eliminate the necessity
for, such withholding. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable party.

of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is
in the form of a prototype plan with respect to which the IRS has issued a
favorable opinion letter and no events have occurred that could reasonably be

liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. The Plans comply in all

(as that term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
or breaches of fiduciary duty (as determined under ERISA) that would

to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"

and subject to ERISA) or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at

single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any other Person. There

neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) (i) result in any payment becoming due to any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, 

(ii) increase any benefits under any Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits under any Plan or (iv)
result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement that would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of
any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not be a factor causing payments to be made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be non‑deductible (in whole or in part) under Section 280G of
the Code. No Plan provides for the gross‑up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

their respective dates, (i) each Company Regulatory Report complied in all
material respects with applicable Law and (ii) no Company Regulatory Report
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, (i) none of the Company Broker‑Dealers is
in default or violation, and no event has occurred which, with notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or a violation, in any
material respect of term, condition or provision of any material license or
permit to which it is a party, to which its business is subject or by which
its properties or assets are bound and (ii) there are no facts or
circumstances which would reasonably be expected to form the basis for any
such default or violation. None of the Company Broker‑Dealers has received,
since January 31, 2013, any notification or written communication (or, to the

Entity (i) asserting non‑compliance with any applicable Law or (ii)

in any of the foregoing).

(j) Each of the Company Broker‑Dealers has adopted and implemented written
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent and detect any
material violations under applicable securities, commodities or other
investment‑related or trading‑related laws, as required by the SEC, FINRA and

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller is not subject to or obligated
under its certificate of organization, limited partnership agreement, any

permit, or subject to any order, writ, injunction or decree, which would be
breached or violated in any material respect by the Seller's execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.05 Governmental Consents. Except for the applicable requirements of the HSR

shares of Class A Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration, except in
connection with a change in control of Parent, pursuant to an effective
registration under the Securities Act, or in a transaction which, in the
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or the Seller, qualifies
as an exempt transaction under the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that no opinion of
counsel will be required if the sale or transfer of such shares is pursuant to
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities 

Act (or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time
permit Parent to sell its securities to the public without registration but
excluding Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor or
similar rule as may be enacted by the SEC from time to time) ("Rule 144").

(b) Certificate Legend. The certificates evidencing the shares of Class A
Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration will bear the following legend
reflecting the foregoing restrictions on the transfer of such securities:

ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT OR IN A TRANSACTION WHICH
QUALIFIES AS AN EXEMPT TRANSACTION UNDER THE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
PROMULGATED THEREUNDER."

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) proposing and
entering into good faith negotiations, providing information, making
proposals, and entering into and performing contracts or submitting to orders
regarding (A) the sale, divestiture, licensing, holding separate, or other
disposition (and whether through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of
any assets, operations, businesses, divisions, or customers (including, after
the Closing, any of such items of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and/or (B) the termination or
modification of any contract or other business relationship, including the
taking of any action that limits the freedom of action, of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.04 shall require
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company or any of its 

Subsidiaries) to take or agree to take any action, which the Purchaser has
determined in its sole discretion would be reasonably likely to (i) materially
and adversely affect the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or (ii) delay beyond the time periods otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action in the foregoing
clause (i) or (ii), a "Burdensome Condition"). Nothing in this Section 9.04(e)
shall obligate the Purchaser to agree to any divestitures or other remedy or
take any other action contemplated by the preceding sentence that is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Closing.

9.05 Conditions. The Purchaser shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 to be satisfied as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, to cause the Closing to occur as
expeditiously as possible following the execution of this Agreement and to
take all other reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IV (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing itself, but subject to such conditions being able to
be satisfied at the Closing). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for purposes of Section 9.04 and this Section 9.05, the Purchaser
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates or the Purchaser's
Representatives to, intentionally take any action that is reasonably likely to
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

9.06 Dash Contribution Agreement. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall take, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take, any and
all actions directly or indirectly required to be taken pursuant to and in
accordance with the Transition Services Agreements and Sections 7.4, 7.5,
7.11, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 8.6 and 12.1 (including with respect to facilitating the
calculations of the amounts set forth in Section 1.10 of the Dash Contribution
Agreement) and Article XIV (to the extent applicable) of the Dash Contribution
Agreement (the "Dash Continuing Obligations"). The Seller shall take any and
all actions, at or prior to the Closing Date, necessary to ensure that the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries,
shall not have any obligation (other than the Dash Continuing Obligations)
under the Dash Contribution Agreement including with respect to the
Distribution (as such term is defined in the Dash Contribution Agreement), any
adjustments to consideration and all indemnification obligations provided
thereunder. The Seller may cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to assign
any of their rights or obligations under the Dash Contribution Agreement
before or after the Closing Date; provided that no such right that is
pertinent to any Dash Continuing Obligation shall be assigned without also
assigning such Dash Continuing Obligation.

9.07 NASDAQ Listing. Promptly following the issuance of the Stock
Consideration, the Company shall cause the shares of Class A Common Stock to
be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.

9.08 Certificate Legend Removal. Pursuant to Parent's receipt of an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent that registration under the
Securities Act is not required, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to remove, or cause its registrar and transfer agent to remove, the legend set
forth in Section 6.10(b) hereof from the certificates evidencing the shares of
Class 

A Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration, following the Seller's written
request to have such legend removed.

9.09 Closing Efforts. The Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts
(including executing documents effective as of the Closing upon the occurrence
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in favor of the landlord
under the Specified Lease that expressly replace BNYM's obligations) to cause
BNYM to be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the guaranty provided
by BNYM of any obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Specified Guarantee as of the Closing Date; provided, however, such release
shall be solely with respect to any guaranteed obligations arising out of or
in connection with any conditions first arising after the Closing and, if such
release is not obtained, in the alternative, the Parent will indemnify BNYM
for any and all Losses incurred by BNYM pursuant to the Specified Guarantee
for any matter arising after the Closing. BNYM will be a third party
beneficiary to this Section 9.09. The Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Specified Financing Arrangement to be obtained as
soon as practicable following the date hereof.

ARTICLE X 

TERMINATION

10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

(b) by the Purchaser upon written notice to the other parties hereto, if there
has been a material violation or breach by the Company or the Seller of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the
Purchaser at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by
the Purchaser or, if curable, cured by the Company or the Seller within 10
days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from the
Purchaser; provided, however, that the Purchaser may not so terminate if it
has materially breached this Agreement so as to cause any conditions set forth
in Section 4.01 not to be satisfied;

(c) by the Seller upon written notice to the other parties hereto, if there
has been a material violation or breach by the Purchaser of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Seller at the Closing
and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Seller or, if curable,
cured by the Purchaser within 10 days after receipt by the Purchaser of
written notice thereof from the Seller; provided that the following violations
or breaches shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Seller and shall be deemed breaches or violations that
prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations of the Seller at
the Closing: (i) a breach by the Purchaser of Section 7.09, (ii) the failure
of the Closing to occur on the date specified in Section 2.01 or (iii) the
failure to deliver the Closing Consideration at the Closing as required
hereunder; provided further that the Seller may not so terminate if it has
materially breached this Agreement so as to cause any conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 not to be satisfied; or 

(d) by the Purchaser or the Seller upon written notice to the other parties
hereto, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated on
or before October 2, 2017 (such date, the "Outside Date"); provided that if
either or both of the conditions set forth in Sections 4.01(d) and 4.02(c)
shall not have been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date, then the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended to January 2, 2018 (in which case
all references to the Outside Date herein shall be to the Outside Date as
extended); provided further that (i) the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.01(d) shall not be available to any party if it has
materially breached this Agreement so as to prevent any condition set forth in
Section 4.01, in the case of a purported termination by the Purchaser, or
Section 4.02, in the case of a purported termination by the Seller, not to be
satisfied and (ii) if the satisfaction, or waiver by the appropriate party, of
all of the conditions contained in Article IV (other than those conditions
that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to such conditions being able to be satisfied at the Closing) occurs two
Business Days or less prior to the Outside Date, then neither the Purchaser
nor Seller shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01(d) until the third Business Day after the Outside Date.

10.02 Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Purchaser or the Seller as provided in Section 10.01, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this Section 10.02, Article XIII and Article XIV
and the Confidentiality Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the
part of the Purchaser, the Company or the Seller to one another, except for
willful breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination. For
purposes of clarification, the parties agree that if the Purchaser does not
close the transactions contemplated hereby in circumstances in which all of
the closing conditions set forth in Section 4.01 have been satisfied or
waived, such election shall be deemed to be a willful breach of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE XI 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

11.01 Post‑Closing Attorney‑Client and other Matters.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) one or more of the
Company, the Seller, their respective Subsidiaries, and GTCR LLC have retained
KandE to act as their counsel in connection with the Transaction as well as
other past and ongoing matters, (ii) KandE has not acted as counsel for any
other Person in connection with the Transaction, and (iii) no Person other
than Company, the Seller, and their respective Subsidiaries has the status of
a KandE client for conflict of interest or any other purpose as a result
thereof. The Purchaser (A) waives and will not assert, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest relating to KandE's
representation after the Closing of the Seller or any of its Affiliates in any
matter involving the Transaction (including any litigation, arbitration,
mediation, or other proceeding), and (B) consents to, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to consent to, any such representation, even though in each case (1) the
interests of the Seller and/or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to the
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, (2) KandE may have
represented 

the Company or its Subsidiaries in a substantially related matter, or (3) KandE
may be handling other ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Company, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, neither the Company, the
Purchaser, nor any of their Subsidiaries will have any right to access or
control any of KandE's records relating to or affecting the Transaction, which
will be the property of (and be controlled by) the Seller. In addition, the
Purchaser agrees that it would be impractical to remove all Attorney‑Client
Communications from the records (including e‑mails and other electronic files)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Purchaser will not, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) not to, use any Attorney‑Client Communication remaining in
the records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after Closing in a
manner that would be adverse to the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(c) The Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), that from and
after Closing (i) the attorney‑client privilege, all other evidentiary
privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney‑Client
Communications belong to the Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, and (ii) the Seller will
have the exclusive right to control, assert, or waive the attorney‑client
privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client
confidence with respect to such Attorney‑Client Communications. Accordingly,
the Purchaser will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including,
after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, (A) assert any
attorney‑client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or expectation of
client confidence with respect to any Attorney‑Client Communication, except in
the event of a post‑Closing dispute with a Person that is not the Seller or
any of its Affiliates; or (B) take any action which could cause any
Attorney‑Client Communication to cease being a confidential communication or
to otherwise lose protection under the attorney‑client privilege or any other
evidentiary privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with a
Person that is not the Seller or any of its Affiliates. The Attorney‑Client
Communication may be used by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection
with any dispute that relates in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a
third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by KandE to such third party; provided, however, that neither the Company nor
its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Seller. Furthermore, the Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf
of each of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), that in the event of a dispute between the Seller or any of its
Affiliates on the one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the
other arising out of or relating to any matter in which KandE jointly
represented both parties, neither the attorney‑client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary
privilege will protect from disclosure to the Seller or its Affiliates any
information or documents developed or shared during the course of KandE's joint
representation. 

(d) For purposes of this Section 11.01, the following terms will have the
following meanings:

(i) "Attorney‑Client Communication‑" means any communication occurring on or
prior to Closing between KandE on the one hand and the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates on the other
hand that in any way relates to the Transaction, including any representation,
warranty, or covenant of any party under this Agreement or any related
agreement and which is protected by the attorney client privilege.

(ii) "Transaction" means the negotiation, preparation, execution, and delivery
of this Agreement and related agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to cooperate, engage in communications and share and exchange
documents, information and analyses with the Purchaser in connection with any
litigation, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding, hearing, charge,
investigation (whether internal or directed or initiated by any Governmental
Entity), petition, demand letter, customer complaint, lien, notice of
noncompliance or violation, or settlement or consent order or proceeding
relating to any Company, any Subsidiary, any of their employees or
representatives, the business of the Company, this Agreement or any matter
herein. The Seller agrees that if any attempt is made by any third party to
secure or obtain communications, documents, information or analyses regarding
the Company, its Subsidiaries, any representative or employee of the Company
or the Subsidiaries, the transaction, this Agreement, or any transaction or
matter herein or therein, whether by subpoena, notice or otherwise, the Seller
shall and shall cause all related persons to promptly notify the Purchaser and
give the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Representatives complete and accurate
copies of all such writings or documents and a summary of all oral
communications. The Seller further agrees that if a request is made, whether
formally or informally, by any person or entity for the Seller, or such other
party or their representatives to make available communications, documents,
information or analyses relating to the Company, one or more of its
Subsidiaries, one or more of their representatives or employees, this
transaction, this Agreement or any matter herein, it will promptly notify the
Purchaser, provide the Purchaser with a copy of any written request or summary
of any oral request, provide the Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to
prevent or limit such disclosure, provide the Purchaser with an opportunity to
comment on any proposed response and use reasonable efforts to incorporate the
Purchaser's reasonable comments in any such response. The cooperation to be
provided under this Section 11.01(e) shall be subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.02(a) through (d), inclusive.

11.02 Tax Matters.

(a) Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed, directly or indirectly, on the Company or the Seller as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer
Taxes, shall be born equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller and 

GTCR Holdings agree to cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any
returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying
any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such returns.

(b) Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar agreements (other than any
agreements the principal purpose of which is not the indemnification of Taxes)
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Affiliate of the Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, shall be terminated and all payables and receivables arising thereunder
shall be settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing
Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder or under any payables or receivables arising
thereunder.

(c) Following the Closing, each of the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries agree that it shall cooperate with and make available to the
other parties hereto, during normal business hours, all books and records,
information and employees (without substantial disruption of employment)
retained and remaining in existence after the Closing that are necessary or
useful in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns and any Tax audit
or other proceeding. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to retain all applicable Tax Returns,
books and records, and workpapers for any Tax period or portion thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date for a period of at least seven (7) years
following the Closing Date. Following the Closing, the Seller, the Purchaser
and the Company and their Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to (i)
complete all final income Tax Returns (including Schedules K‑1) of the Company
for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date by February 15, 2018
and (ii) provide the Seller with any information or estimates reasonably
required by them or their Affiliates for Tax reporting purposes promptly upon
their request. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall control the
preparation and filing of any income Tax Returns of the Company for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. Such income Tax Returns
shall be prepared consistent with past practice of the Company, except as
otherwise required under applicable Law. The Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser for its review and comment a draft of each such income Tax Return at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such
Tax Return. The Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
provided by the Purchaser.

(d) The Closing Consideration, as adjusted under Section 3.01 (plus any
assumed liabilities and other items required to be taken into account for U.S.
federal income tax purposes), shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company (and, as applicable, any Subsidiaries treated as flow‑through entities
for income Tax purposes) in accordance with the principles set forth in the
Allocation Schedule and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder pursuant to a written allocation ("Allocation") delivered by the
Purchaser to the Seller within one‑hundred and twenty (120) days of the
Closing Date. If the Seller notifies the Purchaser in writing that Seller
objects to one or more items reflected in the proposed Allocation, the Seller
and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute;
provided that if the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to the Allocation within thirty (30) days following the
delivery of the proposed Allocation to the Seller, such dispute shall be
resolved by the 

Independent Accounting Firm substantially in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 3.01(b). The Seller and the Purchaser shall file all Tax
Returns and information reports, and shall defend any Tax contest in a manner
consistent with the Allocation, as finally determined hereunder, unless
otherwise required by Law.

(e) For all purposes of this Agreement, with respect to any taxable period
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, Taxes allocable to the
portion of such taxable period beginning on the day after the Closing Date
(the "Post‑Closing Tax Period") shall be determined pursuant to the following
methodology: (x) Taxes, other than those referred to in clause (y) below,
shall be allocated by means of a closing of the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purposes, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass‑through entity or any non‑U.S. entity whose taxable year does not end as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed to
terminate at such time), and (y) real, personal and intangible property Taxes
shall be allocated between the Pre‑Closing Tax Period and the Post‑Closing Tax
Period in proportion to the number of days in each such period.

(f) Except as required by applicable Law, without the prior written consent of
the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to not: (i) file any Tax Return relating to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period other
than consistent with past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
amend any material Tax Return of the Company relating to a Pre‑Closing Tax
Period, (iii) engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar process or
initiate communications with any Tax authority with respect to Taxes
attributable to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period, (iv) extend or waive, or cause to be
extended or waived, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to extend
or waive, any statute of limitations or other period for assessment of any Tax
or deficiency related to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period, or (v) make or change any
material Tax election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to any
Pre‑Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
to the extent such action could reasonably result in the Seller (or its direct
or indirect owners) being liable for any amounts, including under this
Agreement or to any taxing authority.

(g) If, subsequent to the Closing, the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries receives notice of any claim, audit, examination, proceeding or
other investigation by a Governmental Entity relating to the Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Tax Contest") with
respect to any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which the Seller or any of its direct or indirect
owners could be liable, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax Contest
related to Specified Taxes (a "Seller Tax Contest"), then the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Seller thereof in writing. Failure to timely give such
notice shall not relieve Seller from any liability which it may have on
account of any indemnification payment pursuant to Article XII or otherwise
hereunder, except to the extent that Seller is materially prejudiced thereby.
Upon providing written notice to the Purchaser within ten (10) days of receipt
of the above notice from Purchaser, the Seller shall have the exclusive right
to control, at its own expense, the conduct and resolution of any such Seller
Tax Contest that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties agree that, with 

respect to a Seller Tax Contest involving Specified Taxes, no notice is
required to be given by the Purchaser or the Seller and the Seller shall be
deemed to have elected to control the conduct and resolution of such Seller
Tax Contest, subject to the provisions of this Section 11.02. With respect to
any Seller Tax Contest that the Seller does not elect to control pursuant to
the foregoing or that does not relate solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
Purchaser shall control, at its own expense, such Seller Tax Contest, provided
that Seller shall remain liable for any indemnification obligation under
Article XII or otherwise. With respect to any Seller Tax Contest that relates
solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (i) the non-controlling party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel of its choice and to participate fully,
at its own expense, in such Seller Tax Contest, including to review in advance
and comment upon material submissions made in the course of such Seller Tax
Contest and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, (ii) the
controlling party shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
submitted by the non-controlling party pursuant to clause (i) above, (iii) the
controlling party shall diligently pursue such Seller Tax Contest in good
faith as if it were the sole party in interest, (iv) the controlling party
shall promptly provide the non-controlling party with copies of material
correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any
Governmental Entity, shall provide reasonable advance notice to the non-
controlling party regarding any hearings, meetings, or scheduled conference
calls involving any Governmental Entity, and shall otherwise keep the non-
controlling party advised of significant developments in such Seller Tax
Contest and of significant communications involving any Governmental Entity
and (v) if the non-controlling party is (A) the Seller, the Seller's consent
shall be required for any settlement that could affect the liability of the
Seller or its direct or indirect owners (such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (B) Purchaser, the
Purchaser's consent shall be required for any settlement or resolution (such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the
event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 11.02(g) and
Section 12.04 with respect to any Tax Contest, this Section 11.02(g) shall
govern.

(h) After the Closing, any Tax refunds or credits in lieu of Tax refunds of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that relate to a Pre‑Closing Tax Period shall
be for the account of the Seller, and Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause to
be paid over to the Seller, the amount of any such refund or credit, net of
Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, no later than ten (10) days
following the date that such refund is received or such credit is utilized. At
the request of the Seller, if the Purchaser consents (such consent to not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take actions reasonably requested by the
Seller to obtain Tax refunds to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence.

11.03 Employee Matters.

(a) Separations from Employment.

(i) Closing Separations. Within five Business Days after a written request
from the Purchaser to the Seller, the Purchaser shall be provided with an
updated Employee Census. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to cause the employment of each employee listed on 

Schedule 11.03(a)(i) to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that (1) the Company and Purchaser will mutually determine
which employees will be listed on Schedule 11.03(a)(i) (with any revisions to
Schedule 11.03(a)(i) to be shared with the Seller within two (2) business days
of the Purchaser providing the updates to the Company); and (2) prior to
taking any action or making any written or oral communications to any employee
listed on Schedule 11.03(a)(i) pertaining to such termination (including the
offering of any severance benefits or release of claims agreement), the
Company shall inform the Seller and the Purchaser of such intended action and
provide the Seller and the Purchaser with a copy of such intended
communication, as applicable, and consult with the Seller and the Purchaser
regarding such intended action or communication. The Company shall incorporate
the Seller's and the Purchaser's reasonable requests or modifications. In the
event there is a contradiction between the Purchaser's determinations of
employees on Schedule 11.03(a)(i) or requests or modifications contemplated in
the immediately prior sentence, the Purchaser's determinations, requests and
modifications will govern. As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt
of a written request from the Purchaser, the Company provide to the Purchaser
an updated Employee Census including all data within each employee's "personal
profile" on the Company's ADP payroll account, including demographic
information, in order to assist with and/or complete the Purchaser's disparate
impact analysis in respect of the employees listed (or under consideration to
be listed) on each of Schedule 11.03(a)(i) and Schedule 11.03(a)(ii). Subject
to the Company's compliance with the preceding sentence, the Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for any Liabilities or Losses arising under, in
connection with or resulting directly from the selection process conducted by
the Purchaser for, and the related termination liabilities in respect of, the
reduction in force pursuant to this Section 11.03(a)(i) to the extent not
related to acts, omissions or other conduct that would otherwise constitute a
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.18
(determined without regard to any materiality or knowledge qualifiers
thereunder) or any pre-Closing acts, omissions or other conduct by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of applicable Law. Seller shall be
solely responsible for any Liabilities or Losses in respect of the termination
of any employee pursuant to this Section 11.03(a)(i) to the extent related to
(i) any conduct that would otherwise constitute a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.18 (determined without
regard to any materiality or knowledge qualifiers thereunder), (ii) other than
any Liabilities related to the terminations of employees pursuant to this
Section 11.03 for which the Purchaser is responsible pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, any pre-Closing acts, omissions or other
conduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of applicable
Law, or (iii) the Company's failure to provide complete and accurate
demographic information pursuant to this Section 11.03(a)(i). The Purchaser,
in mutual agreement with the Seller, shall be permitted to update Schedule
11.03(a)(i), upon written notice to the Company, at any time prior to the date
that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

(ii) WARN Notices. No later than the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
WARN Act notices as required by applicable Law to each employee listed on
Schedule 11.03(a)(ii) and satisfy all other notice obligations under the WARN
Act in connection therewith (including, but not limited to, providing all
required notices to federal, state and local agencies and employee
representatives, as applicable) provided, however, that the Seller and the
Purchaser will mutually determine which employees will be listed on Schedule
11.03(a)(ii). Such notices shall provide each such employee with notice of the
termination of his or her employment as required by applicable Law, shall
request that each such employee continue to report to work and perform his or
her duties until informed otherwise by the Company or the Purchaser, state
that the receipt of any severance is conditioned on the employee continuing to
report to work and performing his or her job duties through the end of the
notice period, and may provide that such termination of employment is
contingent on the Closing. Prior to providing such notices, the Company shall
provide the Purchaser with a copy of such notices and consult with the
Purchaser regarding such notices. The Purchaser shall have a reasonable period
of time to review and comment on such notices, and, prior to the delivery of
such notices, the Company shall incorporate the Purchaser's reasonable
requests or modifications. The Purchaser, in mutual agreement with the Seller,
shall be permitted to update Schedule 11.03(a)(ii), upon written notice to the
Company, at any time prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. In no event shall the Company terminate an employee listed
on Schedule 11.03(a)(ii) without "cause" and solely as a part of the reduction
in force prior to the expiration of all federal and state WARN Act notice
periods following the employees' receipt of the WARN Act notice itself.

(b) Continued Employment Conditions. As soon as commercially reasonably
practicable following receipt from the Purchaser of Schedule 11.03(b)(i), the
Company shall provide to each employee listed on Schedule 11.03(b)(i) an
employment offer letter from the Purchaser in the form provided by the
Purchaser and all other pre-hire paperwork as requested by the Purchaser in
connection with its pre-hire process. The delivery of such offer letters and
paperwork shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.02(a)
through (d), inclusive. The Purchaser shall be permitted to update Schedule
11.03(b)(i), upon written notice to the Company, at any time prior to the date
that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date; provided the Company
shall be permitted to remove any employee listed on Schedule 11.03(b)(i), only
in the event of such employee's insubordination, misconduct or other acts or
omissions constituting "cause". The employment offer letter shall state that
the employment with the Company of any such employee who fails to execute and
deliver such employment offer letter or who does not complete in all material
respects all such other pre-hire paperwork required by the Purchaser on or
before the Closing Date shall terminate on the Closing Date (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law). Prior to Closing, the Company shall provide the
Purchaser with access to the employees listed on Schedule 11.03(b)(i), as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser from time to time, and shall cooperate
with and take all reasonable actions necessary to assist the Purchaser in its
efforts to obtain an executed employment offer letter from each such employee
and facilitate each such employee's completion of any other pre-hire paperwork
required by the Purchaser 

pursuant to this Section 11.03(b). As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall provide to the Purchaser such information
and documents as reasonably necessary to transition the Continuing Employees
to, or continue to administer, the benefits plans and payroll of the Company,
the Purchaser or its Affiliates (as applicable), including the documents and
information set forth on Schedule 11.03(b)(ii). Each employee listed on
Schedule 11.03(b)(i) who timely executes his or her employment offer letter
and completes the pre-hire paperwork required by the Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 11.03(b) will be employed by the Company (or its Affiliates)
after the Closing Date (each a "Continuing Employee") on an at‑will basis on
terms of employment determined by the Purchaser (or its Affiliates) as set
forth in his or her employment offer letter (and as otherwise required by
applicable Law). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as an
employment contract between the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and any
Continuing Employee. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any
Liabilities or Losses arising under, in connection with or resulting from any
employment offers, or lack thereof, for any employee, or the other actions
taken pursuant to Section 11.03(b) to the extent not related to conduct that
would otherwise constitute a breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.18.

(c) Severance Group. Each employee who is terminated pursuant to Section
11.03(a)(i) above and does not receive an employment offer letter under
Section 11.03(b) (the "Closing Separations Group") shall be offered severance
at least as favorable to the severance calculation set forth on Schedule
11.03(c)(i) and each employee listed on Schedule 11.03(a)(ii) who is
terminated by the Company (or its Affiliates) following the Closing Date (all
such employees, collectively with the Closing Separations Group, the
"Severance Group") shall be offered severance at least as favorable to the
severance calculation set forth on Schedule 11.03(c)(ii), in each case,
regardless of whether such employee is salaried or commission-based, in
exchange for the execution of a separation agreement, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser (which agreement shall contain a general release
of claims in favor of the Company and its Affiliates that must become
effective and irrevocable for severance to be payable). With respect to any
such termination prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall be given a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the form of separation
agreement, and the Company shall incorporate the Purchaser's reasonable
requests. Each employee in the Severance Group shall also be paid for all his
or her accrued but unused vacation and other paid time off through the date of
his or her termination of employment or service.

(d) Post‑Closing Compensation and Benefits. The Purchaser shall (or shall
cause its Affiliates to), based on Company records, provide to each Continuing
Employee service credit, based on the Company's data for each Continuing
Employee in the "hire date" and "rehire date" fields in the Company's ADP
payroll account, for eligibility and vesting purposes as well as determining
level of benefits under any compensation or benefit plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements sponsored by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate (other than any
severance or equity‑based compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement), except to the extent duplication of benefits would result.
During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2017, the Purchaser shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) 

cause the Company or its Affiliates (as applicable) to maintain the current
U.S. Plans that provide health, dental, vision, disability, life and
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, flexible spending account
benefits and the 401(k) Plan and each other compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement that is required by applicable Law;
provided, that, to the extent maintenance of any such plan is not permitted by
applicable Law or the applicable insurers or, in the case of the 401(k) Plan,
to the extent that the 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 11.03(e),
the Purchaser shall provide (on a plan-by-plan basis) such employee benefit
plan coverage under the corresponding group benefit plan of the Purchaser or
its Affiliates maintained for similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or
its Affiliates on the same terms and conditions applicable to such similarly
situated employees. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to honor all vacation or other paid time off accrued all accrued
but unused vacation and other paid time‑off of the Continuing Employees
pursuant to the policies and procedures of the Company as in effect from time
to time to the extent set forth on Section (a) of the Employee Benefits
Schedule and taken into account in the calculation of Tangible Book Value. The
Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for satisfying
the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all
individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B‑9.

(e) 401(k) Plan. If requested by the Purchaser in writing at least 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate to terminate the Company's Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k)
Plan") effective no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. If the Company is required to terminate the 401(k) Plan, then
the Company shall provide to the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date written
evidence of the termination of the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of
which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(f) Deferred Compensation Plan. Effective no later than the Closing Date, the
Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate (including obtaining
any and all Company Service Provider consents) to (i) amend the Deferred
Compensation Plan to eliminate all investment alternatives available
thereunder and replace such investment alternatives with the investment
alternative set forth on Schedule 11.03(f)(i) and (ii) re‑allocate all
notional investments in the investment alternatives so eliminated to a
notional investment in the investment alternative set forth on Schedule
11.03(f)(i). From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to administer and pay benefits in accordance with the Deferred
Compensation Plan, as amended pursuant to this Section 11.03(f). As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof but no later than the Closing
Date, the Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide to the
Purchaser all information and documents necessary to administer and pay
benefits in accordance with the Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended
pursuant to this Section 11.03(f).

(g) WARN Act Liability. The Seller shall be solely responsible for any
Liabilities or obligations arising under WARN Act on or prior to the Closing
Date; provided, that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the
portions of any Liabilities or obligations arising 

under WARN Act resulting from any termination of employment pursuant to
Section 11.03(a)(i) to the extent not related to conduct that would otherwise
constitute a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
5.18. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities or
obligations arising under WARN Act from and after the Closing Date; provided,
that, prior to the Closing, the Seller shall have provided to the Purchaser a
complete and accurate list, as of the Closing Date, of each employee whose
employment has been terminated involuntarily within the 90‑day period
immediately preceding the Closing Date, together with the date of such
termination and such former employee's work location.

(h) TUPE. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to,
reasonable due diligence requests from the Purchaser for the purpose of
confirming compliance with the U.K. Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations.

(i) Retention Pool. Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Purchaser may
identify employees of the Company to whom the Company will agree to pay a
bonus on or promptly following the Closing (such employees, the "Retention
Pool Employees" and such bonuses, the "Retention Pool Bonuses"). The
determination of Retention Pool Employees and the amount of the Retention Pool
Bonuses, if any, shall be mutually determined by the Company and the
Purchaser. In no event shall the aggregate amount of the Retention Pool
Bonuses exceed $700,000. In accordance with the definition and calculation of
Tangible Book Value, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the economic
effect of Retention Pool Bonuses shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Seller.

(j) No Third‑Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Section 11.03 shall (i)
create any third‑party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any
Continuing Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, (ii) be
construed as in any way modifying or amending the provisions of any Plan or
any employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or (iii)
require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to continue or maintain the
employment of any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date.

ARTICLE XII 

INDEMNIFICATION

12.01 Survival. Each of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date which is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a)
(i) any representation or warranty contained in the Company Indemnity
Fundamental Reps or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
and related thereto and (ii) any representation or warranty contained in the
Purchaser Fundamental Reps or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and related thereto (each of (i) and (ii), the "Fundamental
Representations") and (b) any representation or warranty contained in Section
5.08 (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date
which is 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period (after giving effect to any waivers and extensions
thereof). All covenants set forth in this Agreement which by their terms 

are to be performed in whole on or prior to the Closing shall survive for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and all other
covenants shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms as
expressly specified herein. No claim for indemnification hereunder for breach
of any such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
provisions may be made after the expiration of the applicable survival period.

12.02 Indemnification by the Seller.

(a) From and after the Closing and regardless of any investigation at any time
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or of any knowledge or information that
the Purchaser may have, the Seller shall indemnify and fully defend, save and
hold the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
members, managers, agents and employees (the "Purchaser Indemnitees"),
harmless if any Purchaser Indemnitee shall incur Losses arising out of or
resulting from one or more of the following:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Seller
contained in Article V or Article VI of this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered to the Purchaser in connection with the Closing;

(ii) any failure of the Company or the Seller to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the
Seller;

(iii) the matters set forth on Schedule 12.02(a)(iii);

(iv) Pre-Closing Taxes, to the extent not taken into account in the
calculation of Tangible Book Value;

(v) any Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to
Section 11.02(a); or

(vi) any CIC/Severance Amount, to the extent not taken into account in the
calculation of Tangible Book Value;

provided, however, that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(i) hereof (other than
with respect to Company Indemnity Fundamental Reps, the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.08 (Tax Matters) or in the case of fraud)
unless and until the Purchaser Indemnitees have incurred Losses pursuant to
this Article XII in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible
Amount"), and with respect to any given claim for Losses, such claim is
individually in excess of $25,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recovery in accordance with this
Article XII only for such Losses that are in excess of the Deductible Amount
in the aggregate and the Threshold Amount individually; and provided, further,
that (A) the aggregate liability of the Seller under Section 12.02(a) hereof
(other than solely with respect to breaches of the Company Indemnity
Fundamental Reps, breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.08 (Tax Matters) (other than Income Tax Reps), Pre-Closing Taxes or
in the case of fraud) shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account and (B) the aggregate liability of the Seller
under Section 12.02(a) for breaches of the representations and warranties 

contained in Section 5.08 (Tax Matters) and Pre-Closing Taxes ("Tax Claims")
shall not exceed the aggregate of the Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and the Tax Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining in the
Tax Indemnity Escrow Account. The Purchaser Indemnitees' sole and exclusive
source of recovery against the Seller for indemnification (other than solely
with respect to breaches of the Company Indemnity Fundamental Reps, Tax Claims
or in the case of fraud) shall be against such Indemnity Escrow Funds (such
funds to be disbursed in accordance with Section 12.05(f)), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not have any liability for any amounts
due pursuant to this Article XII (other than solely with respect to breaches
of the Company Indemnity Fundamental Reps, Tax Claims or in the case of fraud)
except to the extent of funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Account (such
funds to be disbursed in accordance with Section 12.05(f)). The Purchaser
Indemnitees' sole and exclusive source of recovery against the Seller for
indemnification with respect to Tax Claims shall be against the Indemnity
Escrow Funds (such funds to be disbursed in accordance with Section 12.05(f))
and the Tax Indemnity Escrow Funds, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller shall not have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to this
Article XII with respect to Tax Claims except to the extent of funds available
in the Indemnity Escrow Account (such funds to be disbursed in accordance with
Section 12.05(f)) and the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account; provided, that
Purchaser's recovery with respect to Excess Specified Taxes shall be limited
to the Tax Indemnity Escrow Funds available in the Tax Indemnity Escrow
Account. The aggregate liability of the Seller pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(i)
solely with respect to the breach of Fundamental Representations shall not
exceed the amount of proceeds received by the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that any amounts owing from the Seller to any Purchaser
Indemnitee under this Article XII shall first be satisfied out of the
Indemnity Escrow Account (such funds to be disbursed in accordance with
Section 12.05(f)), to the extent any Indemnity Escrow Funds remain therein,
prior to any amounts being paid directly by the Seller. The Purchaser agrees
that (other than with respect to Company Indemnity Fundamental Reps or in the
case of fraud) other than indirectly through the payment of all or a portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Funds and the Tax Indemnity Escrow Funds to the
Purchaser if and as required by the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, under no circumstances will the Seller have any liability to any of
the Purchaser Indemnitees relating to or arising from this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including in any
exhibit, schedule, or certificate delivered hereunder. The Purchaser hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any claim against, and shall
have no recourse to, the Seller under any theory of Law or equity, including
under any control person liability theory for any action or inaction of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to any indemnification under
Section 12.02(a) hereof with respect to Losses attributable to Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) that are attributable to any actions or
transactions not contemplated under this Agreement consummated on the Closing
Date after the Closing that are not in the ordinary course of business, (B)
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Period other than as a result of a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.08(h) or Section 5.08(j), or (C) that were
reflected as a liability in the calculation of Tangible Book Value.

12.03 Indemnification by the Purchaser. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall indemnify and agree to fully defend, save and hold the Seller,
and each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, members, managers, agents and
employees (the "Seller Indemnitees") harmless if any 

Seller Indemnitee shall incur any Losses arising out of or resulting from, or
shall pay or become obligated to pay any Losses arising out of or resulting
from, one or more of the following:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in
Article VII of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to the Seller in
connection with the Closing; or

(ii) any failure of the Purchaser duly to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that survives beyond the Closing on the part of
the Purchaser to be performed.

The aggregate liability of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.03 shall not
exceed the amount of proceeds received by the Seller.

12.04 Procedures for Indemnification.

(a) If a Person entitled to indemnification under this Article XII (an
"Indemnitee") claims that a Person obligated to indemnify it under this
Article XII (an "Indemnitor") has become obligated to such Indemnitee pursuant
to Section 12.02 (other than pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(iii)) or 12.03, or
if any suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding is begun, made or
instituted by a third party as a result of which the Indemnitor may become
obligated to an Indemnitee hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnitee
shall give prompt written notice to the Indemnitor describing such claim with
reasonable detail. No delay in delivering such written notice to the
Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless,
and then solely to the extent that, the Indemnitor is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby.

(b) Any Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the
Indemnitor's choice and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof (including the matters set forth in Section 12.02(a)(iii)), other than
an action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim with respect to
Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 11.02; provided that the
Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume the defense of any criminal or
quasi-criminal claims. If the Indemnitor fails to actively and diligently
defend or contest such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right
to do so. In the event that the Indemnitor elects to conduct the defense of
the subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee will use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with and make available to the Indemnitor such assistance
and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and the Indemnitee shall
have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing; provided that the Indemnitor shall be responsible
for the fees and expenses of one separate co‑counsel for all Indemnitees
choosing to participate in the defense to the extent the Indemnitee is
advised, in writing by its outside counsel, that either (i) the counsel the
Indemnitor has selected has a conflict of interest or (ii) there are legal
defenses available to the Indemnitee that are materially different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor will not have the right to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim or will cease to defend against such claim, if (i)
injunctive or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
that the Indemnitee reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, is material and not incidental to such claim and cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages, is sought and could be imposed
against the Indemnitee, (ii) such claim would reasonably 

be expected to result in greater liability to the Indemnitee than the
Indemnitor, taking into account the Deductible Amount and other limitations on
indemnification herein, or (iii) the Indemnitor is also a party or has an
interest in such Third Party Claim, which interest conflicts with the
interests of the Indemnitee.

(c) If the Indemnitor elects to control the defense of any Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such Third Party Claim;
provided, that, the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or
will involve an admission of fault or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnitee
or the applicable Indemnitees, or if such settlement does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations
with respect to such claim without prejudice, except for payments that would
be required to be paid by the Purchaser representing the Deductible Amount
and/or the Threshold Amount. If the Indemnitor has elected not to control the
defense of any such claim then Indemnitee shall not settle such claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If a Purchaser Indemnitee is
asserting a claim for indemnification under Section 12.02, the Seller shall
have the rights of the Indemnitor hereunder and the reasonable expenses of the
Seller incurred in defending a claim (or any participation in a claim that
could result in a disbursement to the Purchaser Indemnitees from the Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account) shall be reimbursed, when
and as incurred, from the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account or
the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable.

12.05 Other Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) In all cases in determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Company, the Purchaser or the
Seller for purposes of this Article XII, or in determining the amount of any
Losses with respect to such breach, such representations, warranties and
covenants shall be read without regard to any materiality qualifier (including
any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein.

(b) Except with respect to fraud, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that,
from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this Article XII
are the Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy against the Seller for any claim
with respect to the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder.

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 12.02 or
12.03 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit realized by the
Indemnitee or its Affiliates on account of such Loss, but only to the extent
such Tax Benefit is realized on or prior to the date on which the
indemnification payment is made on account of such Loss, and (ii) any
insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
recovered by the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto, net of
any retropremiums and costs of recovery, if any. The Indemnitee shall take all
commercially reasonable actions to seek full and prompt recovery under all
insurance policies and any other rights, remedies or agreements covering any
Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is
made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has 

been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor.

(d) Each of the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledges that a failure to
mitigate any Losses may result in a lesser recovery pursuant to Delaware
common law in a breach of contract action.

(e) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain
payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of
any one Loss or related group of Losses.

(f) All amounts owed to any Purchaser Indemnitee in respect of Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.02 which are satisfied out of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be distributed in a ratio of cash to Class A
Common Stock (valued based on the 30-day volume-weighted average price per
share as of the day prior to the date of determination) equal to the Indemnity
Escrow Funding Ratio, and all amounts owed to any Purchaser Indemnitee in
respect of Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.02 which are satisfied
out of the Tax Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be distributed in a ratio of cash
to Class A Common Stock (valued based on the 30-day volume-weighted average
price per share as of the day prior to the date of determination) equal to the
Tax Indemnity Escrow Funding Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that (i) all cash amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity
Escrow Account, as applicable, have been released from the Indemnity Escrow
Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, the Purchaser
Indemnitees' sole and exclusive source of recovery against the Seller for
indemnification (other than solely with respect to breaches of the Company
Indemnity Fundamental Reps) shall be against the Class A Common Stock in the
Indemnity Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable,
and (ii) all Class A Common Stock in the Indemnity Escrow Account or the Tax
Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, have been released from the Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, the
Purchaser Indemnitees' sole and exclusive source of recovery against the
Seller for indemnification (other than solely with respect to breaches of the
Company Indemnity Fundamental Reps) shall be against the cash in the Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, and in no
event shall the Seller have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to
Section 12.02 (other than solely with respect to breaches of the Company
Indemnity Fundamental Reps) except to the extent of amounts available in the
Indemnity Escrow Account or the Tax Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable.

12.06 Purchase Price Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any payments pursuant to this Article XII shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE XIV 

MISCELLANEOUS

14.01 Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. In making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Purchaser has relied solely and exclusively on the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article V, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, and the representations and warranties of the Seller set
forth in Article VI, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. Such
representations and warranties by the Company or the Seller, as applicable,
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company or the Seller, as applicable, to the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Purchaser understands, acknowledges
and agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the
Company, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by the Company and the
Seller. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE SELLER, THE COMPANY
OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES OR PROVIDES, AND THE PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY
WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR
CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES' ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF.
In connection with the Purchaser's investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Purchaser has received certain projections, including
projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. The
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that neither the Company nor the Seller is
making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, budgets, pipeline reports, forecasts and plans, and that the
Purchaser has not relied on any such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline
reports or other forecasts or plans. The Purchaser further agrees, for itself
and for its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners,
members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(each a "Purchaser Party"), that none of the Company, the Seller or any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to any Purchaser Party
resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser or any other Purchaser Party,
or the Purchaser's use of, any such information, including any information,
document or material made available to the Purchaser or any other Purchaser
Party in certain "data rooms," management presentations, the confidential
information memorandum, or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including liability related to the
completeness or accuracy of any such information, except as otherwise provided
herein.

14.02 Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by
any party hereto (or any controlled Affiliate to a party hereto) without the
joint approval of the Purchaser and the Seller, unless required by Law, in
which case the Purchaser and the Seller shall have the right to review such
press release, announcement or communication prior to issuance (to the extent
practicable), distribution or publication. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge and agree that GTCR Holdings and its Affiliates may
provide general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in
connection with its fund raising, marketing, informational or reporting
activities. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the Purchaser, or, after the Closing, the Company, have any right
to use the name or mark of GTCR Holdings or any of its Affiliates, or any
abbreviation, variation or derivative thereof, in any press release, public
announcement or other public document or communication without the express
written consent of GTCR Holdings.

14.03 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company, on
the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall pay all of their own
expenses (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses) in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of their
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided that the Purchaser shall pay the applicable portion
of the Transaction Expenses as provided in Section 2.02(d).

14.04 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered,
(b) when transmitted via facsimile machine to the number set out below if the
sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized
overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the day following the day

has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier
service or (d) the third Business Day following the day on which the same is
sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid. Notices, demands and

applicable address set forth below, unless another address has been previously
specified in writing:

14.05 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties; provided, however, that the Purchaser may assign its rights
(but not its obligations) hereunder to any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries; provided, further, that Purchaser nonetheless shall remain
responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder.

14.06 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, unless the
severance of such provision would be in opposition to the parties' intent with
respect to such provision. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

14.07 References. The table of contents and the section and other headings and
subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto,
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure
Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an article of this
Agreement, section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule
to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure
Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in
this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or
any variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. The phrase "ordinary course
of business" shall be deemed to be followed by "consistent with past
practice." Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term
used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural
or singular form.

14.08 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any
information set forth in any Schedule or incorporated in any Section of the
Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth only for purposes of such
Section except that the information therein shall apply and shall be deemed to
modify the representations and warranties in Article V or Article VI of the
Agreement whether or not such representations and warranties refer to such
Schedule or any Schedule to the extent the relevance of such information to
such other Sections is reasonably apparent on its face; provided that the
disclosures and information in the Schedules shall not expand any
representation or warranty in Article V or Article VI. The specification of
any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract). For
purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting on its behalf
posts not less than 12 hours in advance of the date hereof a document to the
online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and accessible to Purchaser
and its representatives and located at http://services.intralinks.com, such
document shall be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made
available" (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the Company.

14.09 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller.

14.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

14.11 Third‑Party Beneficiaries. Section 9.03 shall be enforceable by each
Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and representatives. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

14.12 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

14.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

14.14 Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

14.15 Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
14.04 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

14.16 Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION
SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE
OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY.

14.17 Non‑Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may
only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties to
this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement, and
then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such parties set forth
in this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner,
manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of
any party to this Agreement or any Subsidiary of the Company will have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement.

14.18 Specific Performance.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non‑breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding.

14.19 Time is of the Essence. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge and
agree that time is of the essence for each and every provision of this
Agreement.

14.20 Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and
absolutely guarantees (the "Parent Guarantee") to the Seller the full and
punctual performance and discharge of all of the Purchaser's obligations under
this Agreement of any kind or nature whatsoever, including the full and
punctual payment when due of any sums due and owing the Seller in connection
with this Agreement (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Parent Guarantee is a
guarantee of timely payment and performance and not merely of collection, and
a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Parent to
enforce such Parent Guarantee, irrespective of whether any action is brought
against Parent or any other Person or whether Parent or any other Person is
joined in any such action or actions. Parent hereby makes the representations
and warranties set forth in Article VII, mutatis mutandis, as if it were the
Purchaser hereunder. Parent's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force
and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid or performed in
full. If at any time any payment of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency or receivership of
the Purchaser or otherwise, Parent's obligations hereunder with respect
thereto shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made
at such time. This is a continuing guarantee of Parent and shall be binding
upon Parent and its successors and assigns.
