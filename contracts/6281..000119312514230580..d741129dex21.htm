as of this 9th day of June, 2014, by and among Analog Devices, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Parent"), BBAC Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "Purchaser"), and Hittite
Microwave Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
Purchaser has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be extended
and amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer")
to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") for $78.00 per share, net to
the seller in cash, without interest (the "Offer Price");

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser
will, in accordance with Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent, and each share of Company Common Stock,
except as otherwise provided herein, will be converted in the Merger into the
right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), subject to any required withholding Taxes;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
unanimously (a) adopted, approved and declared the advisability of this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement collectively, the "Transactions"), (b) declared that it is
in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company that
the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions and that
the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, (c) declared that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are
fair to the Company and the Companys stockholders and (d) resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

 

WHEREAS, the respective board of directors of the Parent and the Purchaser
have adopted, approved and declared it advisable for the Parent and the
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, the Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall
be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER_

1.1  _The Offer_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within ten business
days after the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")), the Offer. On the terms and subject to the
prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Date and shall pay the Offer Price
for all such shares of Company Common Stock as soon as practicable after
acceptance and in compliance with applicable laws. The obligation of the
Parent and the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay the Offer Price for
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex
I_ to this Agreement (the "Offer Conditions"). The first time that the
Purchaser accepts for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is referred to herein as the
"Acceptance Time."

 

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day
after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules
14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) (such date and the time on which
the Offer expires on such date, the "Initial Expiration Date"). The Purchaser
expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to
waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent
of the Company, the Purchaser shall not:

(i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the Offer
Price or decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
pursuant to the Offer;

(ii) extend the Expiration Date except (A) as required by applicable law
(including for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
or the staff thereof), (B) that if, immediately prior to the scheduled
Expiration Date, any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived,
the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Expiration Date for one
or more periods (not in excess of ten business days each) but in no event
later than the Outside Date, or (C) in connection with an increase in the
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to comply with applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
the right of the Parent and the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 9.1, if immediately prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date, one or more Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived by the
Parent or the Purchaser, then at the request of the Company, the Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to extend the Expiration Date for one or (as needed)

 



\- 2 -  more consecutive periods of five business days each (or such shorter period
as the Company may agree or such longer period as the Company and the Parent
may agree) in order to permit the satisfaction of any such Offer Condition,
except that if immediately prior to any scheduled Expiration Date, all Offer
Conditions (except the Minimum Condition) have been satisfied or waived by the
Parent or the Purchaser, then the Parents obligations to extend the
Expiration Date shall be limited to causing the Purchaser to extend the
Expiration Date for one period of ten business days to permit the satisfaction
of the Minimum Condition, and if at the end of such ten business day period,
the Minimum Condition continues to not be satisfied, to causing the Purchaser
to extend the Expiration Date for one additional period of ten business days
to permit the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, after which, if the
Minimum Condition remains unsatisfied, the Purchaser shall not be required to
extend the Expiration Date (it being understood that, in no event, shall the
Parent or the Purchaser be required to extend the Expiration Date to a date
that is later than the Outside Date notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement);

(iii) waive or change the Minimum Condition; 

(iv) amend any term of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the
Company or to holders of shares of Company Common Stock; or

(v) impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in _Annex I_.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Expiration Date" means the Initial Expiration
Date or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been
so extended.

(c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the
Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase"), a form of the related letter of transmittal, and ancillary
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
the "Offer Documents"). The Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents contains any material omission therein, and the Parent and
the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Schedule TO and, as applicable, the Offer Documents and to cause the Schedule
TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents as so amended and supplemented to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
or dissemination to the

 



\- 3 -  stockholders of the Company. The Parent and the Purchaser shall as promptly
as practicable provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written
comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Parent, the
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the
Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses
thereto (contemporaneously with delivery of the same to the SEC) and
telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of the Parent or the
Purchaser or their counsel. The Parent and the Purchaser shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any such SEC comments. The Parent and the Purchaser
shall consider in good faith any comments provided by the Company and its
counsel hereunder prior to the filing of the applicable Schedule TO or Offer
Documents with the SEC.

(d) The Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser on
a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any and all shares of Company
Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

 

(e) The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any

ARTICLE III

 

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

 

3.1 _Effect of Merger of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Purchaser:

(i) each share of the Purchasers capital stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the same
class of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company, including all shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) above and any Dissenting Shares) shall be
automatically cancelled and extinguished and be converted into and become
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of
any

 



\- 7 -  such shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Book Entry Shares") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of such
Certificate or such Book Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding rights in accordance with
Section 3.2(g).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the
"Dissenting Shares") of the Companys Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii), but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 3.1(a)(iii), without interest. The Company shall give the Parent and
the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands for payment, or notices of intent
to demand payment, received by the Company with respect to the Dissenting
Shares, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Parent and the Purchaser, make any payment with respect
to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

(c) In connection with the Merger, each option to purchase Company Common
Stock (a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each restricted stock award with respect to Company
Common Stock (a "Company RSA") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and each restricted stock unit with respect to Company
Common Stock (a "Company RSU") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 7.10.

 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(it being understood that the transfer agent for the Company Common Stock is
reasonably acceptable to the Company for such purpose) (the "Paying Agent")
for the payment after the Effective Time of the Merger

 



\- 8 -  Consideration upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The
Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent sufficient cash necessary
for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(iii) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or of Book Entry Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a
Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying
Agent and, in the case of Book Entry Shares, delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and title shall pass only upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal, and which letter of transmittal shall be
in such customary form and have such other provisions as the Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Surrender of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in
accordance with the Paying Agents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and properly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii), and the Certificate
or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book Entry
Shares so surrendered is or are registered if, in the case of a Certificate,
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, the person in whose name such
Book Entry Shares are registered shall have delivered to the Paying Agent
instruments of transfer in such form as the Paying Agent may require in
accordance with its customary procedures for the transfer for securities
represented by book entry, and, in each case, the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.2, each Certificate and all Book Entry Shares shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book Entry Shares.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares.
Upon the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock

 



\- 9 -  that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book Entry Shares for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, but shall have no greater rights against the Parent than
may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of the Parent under applicable
law.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate or any Book Entry Shares have not been surrendered as of such time
on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares would (but for this sentence) escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto, as of immediately prior
to such time.

(f) _Investments of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , that (i)
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) following
any such losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
that remains unpaid, the Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Paying Agent to the extent of such insufficiency, and (iii) such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to and be the property of the Parent. The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld by any of them with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



\- 10 - 3.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii), in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof with such customary assurances as the Parent or Paying Agent,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

clause (i) above, none of the following, and no Change arising out of or
resulting from the following, in each case to the extent arising after the

\- 11 -  whether a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or
could occur (except, in the cases of clauses (x) and (y)(A), (E) and (F),
where the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are
disproportionately adversely affected relative to other persons operating in

and its Subsidiaries operate or (B) the economy, credit or financial or
capital markets or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere in
the world where the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including changes
in interest or exchange rates, or (y) any Change arising out of, resulting
from or attributable to (A) changes or prospective changes in law, in
applicable regulations of any Governmental Entity, in generally
accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards, or any changes or
prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the
foregoing in the United States or elsewhere in the world where the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate, (B) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement,
(C) the taking of any action by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
to the extent the taking of such action is expressly required by this
Agreement or the failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take

other investigation or proceeding made, brought or threatened by any of the

Agreement, (E) acts of war (whether or not declared), hostilities, sabotage or

pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters in
the United States or elsewhere in the world where the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate, (G) any decline in the market price, or change in
trading volume, of the Company Common Stock (it being understood, in each
case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
decline or change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be,
a Company Material Adverse Effect), or (H) any failure by the Company to meet
internal, analysts or other earnings estimates or financial projections or
forecasts for any period, or any changes in credit ratings and any changes in
any analysts recommendations or ratings with respect to the Company (it being
understood, in each case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or
contributing to such failure or change may be deemed to constitute, or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably
be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect). For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material", "materially" or

routine Tax filings) with respect to any Company Employee Plan within the last
five years.

(c) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee
Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such
contributions on the Company Balance Sheet). The Company, each Subsidiary of
the Company and each Company Employee Plan are in compliance in all material
respects with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and
the regulations thereunder (including Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K,
Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq.

and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any material
liability (other than for routine benefit payments) under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable law. There are no pending claims (other than routine
benefit claims and proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations
orders) or lawsuits that have been asserted or instituted by, against or
relating to, any Company Employee Plan (including any such claim or lawsuit
against any fiduciary of any such Company Employee Plan), nor is there any
basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

 



\- 35 - (d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the
financial statements of the Company. The assets of each Company Employee Plan
that is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and
records of such Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(e) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination (or opinion) letters

under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no
such determination (or opinion) letter has been revoked and revocation has
not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or
operated since the date of its most recent determination (or opinion) letter
or application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its cost.

(f) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan that was ever
subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA (or functioned like
a defined benefit plan outside the United States, other than as maintained by
a Governmental Entity) or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a
"Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No

any of their ERISA Affiliates.

(g) Each Company Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by
the Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries that are a party thereto or
covered thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the
date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses
related thereto) and no Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or
agreement, summary plan description or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Employee
Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund the Company Employee Plans may be
changed at any time without incurring a sales charge, surrender fee or other
similar expense.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or
written agreement with any stockholders, director, executive officer or other

the Transactions, (ii) require severance, termination or retention payments,
(iii) provide any term of employment or compensation guaranty, (iv) forgive
any indebtedness, (v) require or provide any payment or compensation subject
to Section 280G of the Code (and no such payment or compensation has
previously been made), (vi) promise or provide any tax gross ups or
indemnification, whether under Sections 280G or 409A of the Code or otherwise,
or (vii) measure any values of benefits on the basis of any of the
Transactions. No

 



\- 36 -  stockholder, equity owner, employee, officer, manager or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been promised or paid any bonus or
incentive compensation related to any of the Transactions. The Company has
made available to the Parent the information necessary to accurately calculate
any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of any of the
Transactions for which the Company or the Parent may directly or indirectly
become liable and the amount of deductions that may be disallowed under
Section 280G of the Code as a result of any of the Transactions.

 

(i) No employee, director or officer, or former employee, director or officer
(or beneficiary of any of the foregoing) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any welfare benefits from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, including death or medical benefits (whether or not
insured) beyond retirement or other termination of employment, other than as
applicable law requires and there have been no written or oral commitments
inconsistent with the foregoing.

(j) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable laws, including Tax laws, and made all required
Tax withholdings and payments and reports, in connection with the grant of
Company Stock Options, Company RSAs and Company RSUs to foreign employees and
the exercise of Company Stock Options, Company RSAs and Company RSUs by
foreign employees.

(k) With respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject to the laws of
any jurisdiction outside of the United States (a "Foreign Plan"), the Foreign
Plan (i) since January 1, 2011 has been maintained in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and with all applicable laws, (ii) if intended to
qualify for special Tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment,
(iii) is fully funded or has been fully accrued for on the financial

employees as consultants or independent contractors, or from the
misclassification of consultants or independent contractors as employees.

 

(h) There is no term of employment for any employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company working outside the United States that provides
that the Transactions shall entitle such individual (1) to treat such
Transactions as a breach of any contract, (2) to any payment, benefit or
change of terms of employment (whether or not conditioned upon the occurrence
of any other event) or (3) to treat himself or herself as redundant or

neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has breached or violated

Company, or any such officer, director, owner or employee, to be  suspended,
debarred, proposed for debarment, or excluded from any Government Contract or

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction

corporate action on the part of each of the Parent and the Purchaser (other
than the adoption of this Agreement by the Parent in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of the Purchaser, which shall occur immediately following
execution of this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of the Parent and the Purchaser and

 



\- 46 -  constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the Parent and the
Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
general equitable principles.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Parent and the
Purchaser do not, and the consummation by the Parent and the Purchaser of the
Transactions shall not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, any provision of the charter or by-laws of the Parent or the
Purchaser, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default

waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument

subject to compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (i) through
(iv) of Section 5.2(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Parent or the Purchaser or any
of their properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of
this Section 5.2(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,

contemplated hereunder.

(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with any Governmental Entity is
required by or with respect to the Parent or the Purchaser in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by the Parent
or the Purchaser of the Transactions, except for (i) the pre-merger

approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable "takeover" or state securities laws, and (v)
such consents, approvals, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations, notices and filings, the failure of which to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.

5.3 _Disclosure_. The Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities laws. None of the
information included in the Offer Documents (and none of the information
supplied by the Parent or the Purchaser specifically for inclusion in the

Documents and Schedule 14D-9, at any time such documents are amended or
supplemented or at the time of any distribution or dissemination of such
documents, contain any statement that, in light of the circumstances under
which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact
required to be stated therein or omit to state any material fact

and the Purchaser hereby disclaim any such other representations or
warranties.

the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made or received after

provisions of this Section 7.1) and (y) participate in communications,
discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding
such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.1(a) by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.1(a) by the Company.

obligations under this Section 7.1, the Company Board may withdraw or modify
the recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of this
Agreement or the Transactions in circumstances where the Company Board has 

 



\- 53 -  determined that a Superior Proposal is outstanding, if (A) (1) the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and the Financial Advisor or another nationally recognized

fourth business day following the Parents receipt of written notice (an
"Adverse Recommendation Notice") advising the Parent that the Company Board
desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation (and the manner and timing in
which it intends to do so) (such four business day period, the "Notice
Period"), and (2) the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the Notice Period and negotiates in good faith with the Parent
with respect thereto during the Notice Period, in each case as would enable
the Company Board or committee thereof to proceed with its recommendation in
favor of this Agreement and the Transactions, and (B) (1) such withdrawal is
due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, and the Company has complied
with the requirements of Section 7.1(c), including specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person
making such Superior Proposal, and (2) the Parent shall not have, at or prior
to the end of the Notice Period, made an offer or proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors) to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal taking into account
all relevant considerations. Any changes to the financial terms or any
material change to the other terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior
to the Company Boards effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall require the Company to provide to the
Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new Notice Period and
to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.1(b) with respect to each
such Adverse Recommendation Notice, except that in each such case the
references above to "fourth business day" and "four business day period" shall
be deemed to be "third business day" and "three business day period". In
addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may in response to a material development
or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that
affects the business, assets or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that was neither known to the Company
Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not
relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in
circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), withdraw or modify its recommendation
of this Agreement or the Transactions if the Company Board has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and the Financial
Advisor or another nationally recognized independent financial advisor, that,
in light of such Intervening Event, its fiduciary obligations require it to
take such action; _provided_ that, the Company Board shall not be entitled to
take such action pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided
to the Parent at least four business days prior written notice advising the
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y) during such four business day
period, if requested by the Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
the Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need
for taking such action as a result of the Intervening Event. Any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect that
would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate
takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to any of the
Transactions.

 



\- 54 - (c) The Company shall promptly advise the Parent orally, with written
confirmation to follow within 24 hours, of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any change
to the financial terms or any material change to the other terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii) provide to the Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all written Acquisition Proposals or responses
thereto, draft documentation (including with respect to the financing of any
such Acquisition Proposal) and other material written material sent by or
provided to the Company or its Representatives, including those provided by
electronic mail, to or from any third party in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or sent or provided by the Company or its Representatives to any
third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) if the
Parent shall make a counterproposal, consider in good faith the terms of such
counterproposal. Contemporaneously with providing any information to a third
party in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, the
Company shall (i) make available to the Parent such information provided to
the third party in writing and (ii) make available to the Parent such
information provided to the third party other than in writing that was
not previously provided to the Parent. The Company agrees that it shall not,
and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement that
prohibits or restricts it from providing to the Parent the information
contemplated by, or otherwise complying with, this Section 7.1(c) or Section
7.1(b).

(d) Nothing contained in Section 7.1 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would violate
its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no
event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 7.1(b). For the avoidance of
doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
(so long as it includes a reaffirmation of the recommendation of the Company
Board of this Agreement and does not include a recommendation of such
Acquisition Proposal) shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
directors, officers and employees to, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Companys other Representatives to, cease
immediately all communications, discussions and negotiations regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have
all copies of all nonpublic data and information it or its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives have distributed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement to other potential purchasers returned to the Company as soon as
possible.

 



\- 55 - (f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer for any
transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving: (i) the purchase or other
acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 15% of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding as of the consummation of such purchase or
other acquisition, or any tender offer or exchange offer by any person or
"group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) that, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or
"group" beneficially owning more than 15% of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding as of the consummation of such tender or exchange offer;
(ii) a merger, consolidation, joint venture, recapitalization, business
combination or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to
which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction
hold less than 85% of the voting equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (iii) a sale, transfer, acquisition or
disposition of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof);
or (iv) a liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

"Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal made by
a third party to acquire at least a majority of the equity securities or
assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, sale of its assets or other business
combination, (i) on terms which the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment in light of all relevant considerations to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Transactions (after consultation with the Financial Advisor or another
nationally recognized independent financial advisor), taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
binding proposal by the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii)
that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Superior Proposal unless the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith that any financing required to consummate the
Acquisition Proposal is or will be available taking into account the timing of
the consummation of the transactions proposed by such Acquisition Proposal.

7.2 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and until the Effective
Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any Company Compensation
Arrangement, unless prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or
modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which shall
be determined by the Company Board to be an "independent director" within the
meaning of the applicable NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director"
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps
as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Approved Company
Compensation Arrangement each such Company Compensation Arrangement and (b)
otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to Company Compensation
Arrangement; provided that nothing in this Section 7.2 shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



\- 56 - 7.3 _Nasdaq Quotation_. The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
continue the quotation of the Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market
during the term of this Agreement.

7.4 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or will
be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 

7.5 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and the Companys and such Subsidiaries Representatives to,
afford to the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at all
reasonable times, upon reasonable prior notice during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries
properties, books, records, contracts, commitments and personnel and shall
furnish the Parent all financial, operating and other data and information as
the Parent may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law,
the Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to secure for the Company access to and copies of the
workpapers of its independent public accountants. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in the
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate
any of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be obligated to provide such access or information if doing so would (i)
violate applicable law, (ii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product protection or (iii) expose the Company to
risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information.

 

7.6 _Legal Conditions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 7.6(b) and Section 7.6(c),
the Company and the Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any
Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made
by the Company or the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, (iii) as promptly as practicable (and, in
the case of the Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form filed pursuant to the
HSR Act, in any event within ten business days) after the date of this
Agreement, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions required
under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental
request thereunder, and (C) any 

 



\- 57 -  other applicable law and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable law (including all information required to
be included in the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9) in connection with
the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent and the
Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 7.6(a) shall modify or
affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 7.6(b) or
Section 7.6(c).

 

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals, or expirations or terminations of waiting periods, required for the
consummation of the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law or, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), and
to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law.
The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The Parent, in
consultation with the Company, shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or
negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing,
provided that it shall afford the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. Except as prohibited by
applicable law, each of the Parent and the Company shall keep the other party
and/or its counsel informed of any substantive communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to any Governmental Entity, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions; and permit the other party and/or its
counsel to review any substantive communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with any such
Governmental Entity.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (i) make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of the Parent or any of its Affiliates
or the Company or any of its Affiliates or the holding separate of the shares
of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or
imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of the Parent or
any of its Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company
Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) take
any action under Section 7.6(b) if any Governmental Entity authorizes its
staff to seek a preliminary injunction or restraining order, or otherwise
initiate administrative litigation, to enjoin consummation of any of
the Transactions under any Antitrust Law.

 



\- 58 - (d) Subject to applicable laws (including the Antitrust Laws), the Company
shall confer with the Parent on a regular and frequent basis as reasonably
requested by the Parent concerning operational matters and promptly advise the
Parent orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which, insofar
as reasonably can be foreseen, could result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Parent shall
promptly provide to each other (or its counsel) copies of all filings made by
the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall make any settlement
offers or, except as directed by the Parent, negotiate any consent decree or
consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the
Transactions. The Parent alone, after consultation with the Company, shall be
responsible for making any settlement offers and negotiating any consent
decree or consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the
Transactions. The Parent shall promptly communicate to the Company if any
Governmental Entity suggests or proffers any settlement, consent decree or
consent order, including the material terms thereof (and any written
documentation provided by such Governmental Entity reflecting the same). The
Parent, after consultation with the Company, may accept or reject any
settlement, consent decree or consent order proposed by any Governmental
Entity in its sole discretion.

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.6(a), if any "fair price" or
"control share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar
statute or regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable
to any of the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby, and otherwise act to minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

7.7  _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent if, at any time (i) any
Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect not being true and accurate in any respect
as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and
accurate in any material respect as if such representation or warranty were
made at such time, or (ii) the Company fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall, within 24 hours after it has notice of any
of the following, notify the Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with any of the
Transactions;

 



\- 59 - (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with any of the Transactions; and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to any of the Transactions.

(b) The Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company if, at any time (i)
any Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or
warranty of the Parent or the Purchaser contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality not being true and accurate in any respect as if
such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and
accurate in any material respect as if such representation or warranty were
made at such time, or (ii) the Parent or the Purchaser fails to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by them under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or
otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Parent or the Purchaser or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parent shall notify the
Company within 24 hours after it has any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Entity in connection with any of the Transactions.

 

7.8 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall each use
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, provided that the
foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any press release or public
statement (y) by the Company with respect to a Superior Proposal or a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto or (z) by a
party with respect to any dispute among the parties regarding this Agreement
or the Transactions.

7.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Purchaser shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Companys
obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
extent that such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless exist on
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, or any agreement listed on Section 7.9(a)

 



\- 60 -  of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.9, then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
7.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Parent shall not (and the Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which the Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.9, unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all of the Indemnified Parties covered by the claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parents obligations under this Section 7.9 shall include the obligation to
honor (or cause another of its Affiliates to honor) the Companys
indemnification and other obligations referenced in this Section 7.9 in
circumstances where the Surviving Corporation fails to honor, or is incapable
of honoring, such obligations. The obligations of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall include the advancement of
expenses to the extent required in the organizational documents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and/or in the agreements as set forth in Section 7.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. For a period of six years after
the Effective Time, the Parent shall not cause there to be any changes to the
provisions of the Surviving Corporations organizational documents affecting
the indemnification and other obligations covered by this Section 7.9.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent and the
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent
available in the market) in effect a directors and officers liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been made available to the Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least favorable to
such persons as the Companys existing coverage; provided, that in no
event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policy in excess of 250% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, provided,
further, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Parent and the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount. At the Parents option, the Parent may purchase prior to the
Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy, in which case the Parent and the Purchaser shall be
relieved of their obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
The Company represents and warrants that the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for directors and officers liability insurance coverage is as
set forth on Section 7.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and

 



\- 61 -  officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers
or directors, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 7.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies. The obligations under this Section 7.9
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

7.10 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board or
Compensation Committee shall take all steps necessary (including obtaining
the consent of each holder of a Company Stock Option) to cause all Company
Stock Options that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with Section 3.2(g) with respect to such payment)
determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option by
(y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (the "Option Consideration"). If the holder of any Company Stock Option
does not consent to the treatment of such Company Stock Option contemplated
by the first sentence of this Section 7.10(a) and such Company Stock Option is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled as of, and shall be of no further force or effect
from and after, the Effective Time. Any shares of Company Common Stock issued
prior to the Effective Time upon exercise of a Company Stock Option shall be
treated as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii). Without limitation of the
Companys obligations under this Section 7.10(a), the Company shall, prior to
the Effective Time, deliver to each holder of a Company Stock Option such
advance notice of the cancellation of, and opportunity to exercise, such
Company Stock Option as complies with the applicable Company Stock Plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payment of the
Option Consideration shall be made following the Effective Time in accordance
with the Companys payroll practices.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board
or Compensation Committee shall take all steps necessary to cause all Company
RSUs that are outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be cancelled for no consideration as of, and to have no
further force or effect from and after, the Effective Time (each a "Cancelled
RSU"). Subject to Section 7.10(d), the Parent shall issue promptly after the
Effective Time to each holder of a Cancelled RSU, in substitution for such
Cancelled RSU, a restricted stock unit award or, in Parents discretion, a
restricted stock award under the Parents Amended and Restated 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Parent Stock Plan") for a number of shares of the
Parents common stock, 0.16 2⁄3 par value per share ("Parent Common Stock"),
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Cancelled RSU, multiplied by the Equity Award Ratio (each a "RSU Replacement
Award") and rounded up to the nearest whole share, it being understood that
the number of shares subject to any Cancelled RSU other than a Time-Based
Cancelled RSU shall be deemed to be equal to 100% of the shares at the target
award level under such Cancelled RSU. The Parent shall cause the RSU
Replacement Awards to vest as follows:

 

(i) Any RSU Replacement Award issued in respect of a Cancelled RSU that prior
to its cancellation would have vested based solely on the continued
employment of the applicable employee (a "Time-Based Cancelled RSU") shall
vest in accordance with the vesting schedule that would have been in effect
under such Cancelled RSU as of immediately after the Effective Time if such
Cancelled RSU were not so cancelled.

(ii) Any RSU Replacement Award that is issued in respect of a Cancelled RSU
other than a Time-Based Cancelled RSU shall vest in accordance with the
vesting schedule based solely on the continued employment of the applicable
employee that would have been in effect under such Cancelled RSU as of
immediately after the Effective Time if such Cancelled RSU were not so
cancelled, assuming satisfaction of each performance condition at the target
level.

 



\- 62 - For purposes of this Agreement, "Equity Award Ratio" shall mean an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration, divided by the average closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during the
five consecutive trading days ending on the Closing Date. Each Company RSU
that is vested but unsettled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive an amount in
cash (without interest and less any applicable Tax withholding in accordance
with Section 3.2(g) with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying
the Merger Consideration by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU, which cash amount shall be paid following the
Effective Time in accordance with the Companys payroll practices. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board or
Compensation Committee shall take all steps necessary to cause all Company
RSAs that are outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be cancelled for no consideration as of, and to have no
further force or effect from and after, the Effective Time (each a "Cancelled
RSA"). Subject to Section 7.10(d), the Parent shall issue promptly after the
Effective Time to each holder of a Cancelled RSA, in substitution for such
Cancelled RSA, a restricted stock unit award or, in Parents discretion, a
restricted stock award under the Parent Stock Plan for a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cancelled RSA, multiplied by the Equity Award Ratio and
rounded up to the nearest whole share (each a "RSA Replacement Award"). The
Parent shall cause any RSA Replacement Award issued in respect of a Cancelled
RSA to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule that would have been in
effect under such Cancelled RSA as of immediately after the Effective Time if
such Cancelled RSA were not so cancelled.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.10, if any
holder of a Cancelled RSU or Cancelled RSA (i) is based outside of the United
States or (ii) would otherwise be entitled to any RSU Replacement Award or RSA
Replacement Award for less than 500 shares of Parent Common Stock, then the
Parent shall have the discretion to issue, in lieu of such RSU Replacement
Award or RSA Replacement Award, an award of cash, subject to the vesting
provisions that would have been applicable to such RSU Replacement Award
or RSA Replacement Award, in an amount equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Cancelled RSU or Cancelled RSA,
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 



\- 63 - (e) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to
each holder of a Company Stock Option, Company RSU or Company RSA a notice
(in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent) describing the
treatment thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

7.11 _401(k) Plan_. No later than the day prior to the Acceptance Time if
requested by the Parent, the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Hittite Microwave Corporation 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan,
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to
terminate such plan on the day prior to the Acceptance Time, in each case
subject to the Parents prior review. The Company shall preserve all
documentation and records related to such plan.

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide
to each individual who is a U.S.-based employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company as of the Effective Time (a "U.S. Continuing
Employee") for a period of one year following the Effective Time, annual base
salary and base wages and cash incentive compensation opportunities that are
collectively no lower than those in effect as of the Effective Time and (ii)
until December 31, 2014, provide to the U.S. Continuing Employees employee
benefits (excluding equity compensation) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the employee benefits provided to the U.S. Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) To the extent permitted under the terms of the Parents employee benefits
plans, from and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries of each individual who is an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company as of the Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee")
in connection with all employee benefit plans of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in which any such Continuing Employee is admitted to participation
following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits (but not to the extent that such recognition would result
in duplication of benefits). Each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all of the
Parents employee benefit plans to the extent coverage under such plans is
replacing comparable coverage under an employee benefit plan of the Company in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time.

 

(c) Any U.S. Continuing Employee (other than one who has severance protection
under an individual employment, severance, or retention agreement) whose
employment is terminated by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation within one
year (or such longer period as the Parent determines) after the Effective Time
and prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall (subject
to compliance with any requirement the applicable employer may impose with
respect to a release of claims) receive severance pay equal to the greater of
(i) eight weeks of base salary or wages or (ii) two weeks of base salary or
wages for each year of service, with credit for service both before and after
the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prevent the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation from supplementing such severance as it
determines appropriate. Continuing Employees employed outside the United
States will receive severance, if and when applicable, in accordance with any
applicable plans covering them or as otherwise provided by applicable law.

 



\- 64 - (d) To the extent permitted under the terms of the Parents employee benefits
plans, from and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to
the extent that such waiting periods would be applicable, taking into account
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under any group health,
dental, or vision plans of the Parent maintained in and with respect to the
United States to be waived with respect to U.S. Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents.

(e) If the Companys 401(k) plan is terminated prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 7.11, each U.S. Continuing Employee will be eligible
to participate as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time in
the Parent plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Code. The Parent shall take all steps reasonably necessary to permit each
U.S. Continuing Employee who has an outstanding loan under the Companys
401(k) plan to roll over such loan into an account under the Parents 401(k)
plan, if and to the extent such rollovers are not prohibited under the
participants loan agreement or the Companys loan procedures.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
do not intend for this Section 7.12 to create any rights or obligations except
between the parties hereto nor to amend any employee benefit plan and no
Continuing Employee, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other
person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim
against the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates under this Section 7.12.

 

7.13 _Stockholder Litigation._ Until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company
shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or the Company
Board relating to any of the Transactions, and shall not settle any such
litigation without the Parents prior written consent.

7.14 _Parent Guaranty_. The Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees
the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and agrees to be liable for
any breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser.

condition set forth in _Annex I_ or Section 8.1 and (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice to the Company
of such breach or failure to perform or, if capable of being cured by the

Parent and diligently pursue such cure thereafter ( _provided_ in each case

forth in this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and be of no further force
or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company hereunder, except as set forth in Section 4.25,
Section 5.8, Section 6.2, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X, which

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
messenger service, facsimile, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless

\- 70 - 10.3 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (and the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; _provided_ that, subject to Section 6.2, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

10.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the provisions of Section
7.9, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any
rights or remedies upon any other person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

10.5  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent and/or the Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent without the consent of the
Company, _provided_ that the Parent and/or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

10.6  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the
prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or "PDF" transmission.

 



\- 71 - 10.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, including _Annex I_ , they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." Where this Agreement refers to
information that was "made available", that means that such information was
either (i) provided directly to the Parent or its outside counsel or (ii)
included in the "Project College" virtual file room available at
https://datasite.merrillcorp.com at least 24 hours prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "person" means
any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, trust,
limited liability company, unincorporated organization or other entity. For
purposes of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary of the
Purchaser or the Parent. As used in this Agreement, references to
any "agreement" to which a person is bound means any contract, agreement,
instrument, obligation, undertaking, lease, license, arrangement, commitment
or understanding, whether written or oral, in each case that is or purports to
be legally binding on such person and as it may be amended or otherwise
modified from time to time. As used in this Agreement, references to the
"Companys knowledge" or "knowledge of the Company", or any other phases of
similar meaning, means the knowledge (after reasonable investigation) of the
individuals identified in Section 10.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



\- 72 - 10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or if, neither of such courts
has jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may
make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process
to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.11, however,
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

 

10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARENT, THE PURCHASER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENT, THE PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.13 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates and
time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 

 _Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not defined herein have the

(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer, and may terminate or amend the Offer, and may postpone the

(whether vested or unvested)), together with the shares of Company Common
Stock which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants,

Offer and the Merger) (the "Minimum Condition").
