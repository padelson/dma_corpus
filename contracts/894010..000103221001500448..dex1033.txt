Seller to Purchaser at the Closing);   (h) any claims against or liabilities
of Seller or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries for injury to or death of

asserted, including, any claim or liability for consequential or punitive
damages in connection with the foregoing;   (i) except as specifically
provided in Article IX or in any of the Ancillary Agreements or insofar as

Cash Amount and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities are collectively
referred to herein as the "Purchase Price"). As used herein, the "Cash
Amount" shall mean two hundred ninety million dollars (US $290,000,000),
exclusive of any Taxes imposed under Sections 12.1, 12.6 and any witholding
Taxes but inclusive of the amount to be delivered to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 3.2(b). The Cash Amount will be subject to adjustment as
set forth in Section 3.6 and 6.2(c). On or before the close of business on
April 11, 2001, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller the amount of $45,000,000
(the "Good Faith Deposit"). The Good Faith Deposit shall be an advance on the
Cash Amount and shall be refundable if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement do not close; provided, however, if the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement do not close because of a material breach of this Agreement
by the Purchaser, then the Good Faith Deposit shall be paid to the Seller.
The Good Faith Deposit shall be held by an independent party pursuant to an
escrow agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit N to this
Agreement.   3.2 Allocation of the Purchase Price; Establishment of
Escrow.  ---------------------------------------------------------   (a)
Purchaser and Seller agree that both (i) the Cash Amount and (ii) the
Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets are allocable among the Seller and
the Transferring Subsidiaries as set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, based, 
------------ with respect to the Transferring Subsidiaries, on the relative
net fair market values of the assets and businesses sold by each of the
Transferring Subsidiaries under the Ancillary Agreements. Such Schedule is to
be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The parties agree to
negotiate in good faith any appropriate revisions to the foregoing which may
be appropriate based on the Audited Balance Sheet, and Seller agrees to cause
the Transferring Subsidiaries to settle among themselves any resulting
inequities in the portion of the Cash Amount received by each Transferring
Subsidiary. Seller and Purchaser each agree to prepare and file in a timely
manner an IRS Form 8594 and other appropriate information, as required by
Section 1060 of the Code and pertinent regulations and Internal Revenue
Service instructions, in accordance with any agreement between the parties as
to the Purchase Price and allocation of the Purchase Price, with respect to
those Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities required to be reflected on
such Form. Purchaser and Seller each agree to submit to the other a draft
copy of any Form 8594 that Purchaser or Danka US proposes to file with
respect to the US Purchased Assets at least 45 days before the proposed
filing date thereof and to jointly discuss and attempt to agree, in good
faith, with respect to the contents thereof. To the extent the allocation of
the Purchase Price for the U.S. Purchased Assets is adjusted after the
Closing Date, the parties agree to revise and amend any agreed Schedule
and IRS Form 8594 in the same manner and according to the same procedure.
Each party shall provide to the other party the final version of such Form
and information promptly after filing. The parties shall follow a similar
procedure with respect to the allocation of the agreed Purchase Price among
the assets purchased from the non-U.S. Transferring Subsidiaries under each
of the other Ancillary Agreements. The agreed determination and allocation of
the Purchase Price and any agreed determination and/or allocation of the
Purchase Price to the Purchased Assets shall be binding on Seller and
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates.   (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on the Closing Date the sum of US$5,000,000 shall be deposited
with an escrow agent selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
Seller   8    ("Escrow Agent") in the purchase price adjustment account
(the "Escrow Account") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement among Purchaser,
Seller and the Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit M. Such
amount shall reduce proportionately the amount to be paid to each
Transferring Subsidiary on the Closing Date. When and to the extent such
amounts are paid out of the Escrow Account to the Seller, and subject to
Section 3.6, such pay out shall be for the appropriate benefit of each
Transferring Subsidiary. All such amounts, plus accrued interest, will be
paid out to the Seller or the Purchaser within five business days after the
Actual Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity is agreed to or finally determined.
Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent.   3.3 Time and Place of Closing. The Closing of the sale of
the US  ------------------------- Purchased Assets (the "Closing") shall be
consummated at 9:00 a.m. local time at the offices of Holland and Knight LLP in
Tampa, Florida on the second business day after the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be satisfied or waived, subject, however, to the
provisions of Section 11.2. The Closing of the sales provided for in Section
1.4(a) through (k) (each a "Foreign Closing") shall occur at the offices of
Holland and Knight LLP in Tampa, Florida concurrently with the Closing subject
to the conditions set forth in Section 6.3. Each Closing or Foreign Closing
shall be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m., prevailing time at the
places where the Purchased Assets are located, on the date on which such
Closing (the "Closing Date") shall occur.   3.4 Manner of Payment of the
Purchase Price. The respective portion 
--------------------------------------- of the Cash Amount to be allocated to
the Closing or any Foreign Closing shall be payable in full on the Closing
Date by wire transfers of immediately available funds. For the purpose of
paying the Cash Amount, (i) amounts paid to Danka US shall be payable in U.S.
Dollars; (ii) amounts paid to Seller or Danka UK shall be payable in U.K.
pounds, translated from U.S. Dollars at the applicable foreign exchange rate
as published in the "Key Currency Cross Rates" section of The Wall Street
Journal on the second business day preceding the Closing Date (the
"Applicable Foreign Exchange Rate"); (iii) amounts paid to Danka Canada shall
be payable in Canadian Dollars, translated from U.S. Dollars at the
Applicable Foreign Exchange Rate; and (iv) amounts paid to all
other Transferring Subsidiaries shall be payable in Euros, translated from
U.S. Dollars at the Applicable Foreign Exchange Rate. Said wire transfers
shall be made to such bank accounts of the Seller or the respective
Transferring Subsidiaries selling their respective Purchased Assets as Seller
shall specify by written notice to Purchaser delivered not later than two
business days before the Closing Date.   3.5 Intentionally omitted.   3.6
Adjustment to Purchase Price.  ----------------------------   (a) For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity"
shall mean the shareholders\' equity as set forth on the Audited Balance
Sheet, reduced by the Excluded Assets, increased by the Excluded Liabilities
set forth on the Audited Balance Sheet, subject to adjustment as determined
in accordance with this Section 3.6 (the "Adjusted Balance Sheet"). For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Estimated Closing Date Shareholders\'
Equity" shall mean $81,700,000.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable but
not more than 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver
to Purchaser the audited balance sheet (the "Audited Balance Sheet"),
statement of income and cash flows for the Business as of and for the period
ending on the Closing Date (and having commenced January 1, 2001), prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied using the same accounting
policies and procedures as used in the preparation of the December 31, 2000
audited financial statements (the "Audited Financial Statements") and the
Adjusted Balance Sheet of the Business. The sole intention of this
calculation is to reflect the difference, if any, between the Estimated
Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity and the Closing Date
Shareholders\' Equity.   9    (c) If Purchaser has any objections to the
calculation of the Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity, Purchaser will deliver
a detailed written statement describing such objections to Seller within 30
days after receiving the Adjusted Balance Sheet. Purchaser and Seller will
use commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections
themselves. If the parties do not obtain a final resolution within 30 days
after Seller has received the statement of objections, however, Purchaser and
Seller will select an accounting firm mutually acceptable to them to resolve
any remaining objections. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the
choice of an accounting firm, they will select an accounting firm recognized
nationally in the United States by lot (after excluding their respective
regular independent accounting firms). The determination of any accounting
firm so selected will be set forth in writing and will be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. Seller will revise the Closing Date Shareholders\'
Equity as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto
pursuant to this Section 3.6.   (d) In the event the parties submit any
unresolved objections to an accounting firm for resolution as provided in
Section 3.6(c) above, Purchaser and Seller will share responsibility for the
fees and expenses of the accounting firm as follows:   (i) if the
accounting firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of
Seller\'s statement of the Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity or any
adjustments are, collectively, less than $100,000 (the Closing Date
Shareholders\' Equity so adjusted is the "High Value"), Purchaser will be
responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the accounting firm;   (ii)
if the accounting firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of
Purchaser\'s statement of objections to the Closing Date Shareholders\'
Equity and the adjustments are, collectively, at least $100,000 (the Closing
Date Shareholders\' Equity so adjusted is the "Low Value"), Seller will be
responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the accounting firm; and  
(iii) if the accounting firm resolves some of the remaining objections in
favor of Purchaser and other remaining objections in favor of Seller and the
adjustments total at least $100,000, Seller will be responsible for that
fraction of the fees and expenses of the accounting firm equal to (x) the
difference between the High Value and the Actual Closing Date Shareholders\'
Equity over (y) the difference between the High Value and the Low Value, and
Purchaser will be responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses.  
The "Actual Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity" is the Closing Date
Shareholders\' Equity as adjusted above.   (e) Seller will make the work
papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Audited Financial
Statements and the Adjusted Balance Sheet available to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall make the books, records, and financial staff of the Business
available to Seller and, in each case, their respective accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice at any time
during (i) the preparation by the Seller of, and review by Purchaser of, the
Audited Financial Statements and the Adjusted Balance Sheet and (ii) the
resolution by the parties of any objections thereto. Notwithstanding the
existence of any dispute pursuant to this Section 3.6, the parties shall make
any adjusting payment required under this Section 3.6, to the extent that
such adjusting payment is not disputed, at the time and in the manner set
forth herein.   (f) The Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows:   (i)
In the event that the Actual Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity, as
determined in accordance with this Section 3.6, is more than the Estimated
Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity, Purchaser shall pay such excess to Seller
within three business days after the date on which the Actual Closing Date
Shareholders\' Equity is agreed or finally determined.   10    (ii) In
the event that the Actual Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity is less than the
Estimated Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity, Seller shall pay to Purchaser
(or cause to be delivered from the Escrow Account) the difference between the
Estimated Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity and the Actual Closing Date
Shareholders\' Equity within three business days after the date on which the
Actual Closing Date Shareholders\' Equity is agreed or finally
determined.   (g) Any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
increased by five percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date through
the date of payment.   (h) It is acknowledged that all fees and expenses
paid by the Seller or the Purchaser related to the negotiation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, investment banking, legal and accounting fees) shall not
be taken into account in the calculations contemplated by this Section
3.6.   ARTICLE IV   Representations and Warranties

Affiliates) that will  not be transferred to Purchaser hereunder or leased or

condition (subject to normal wear and tear). To the  knowledge of Seller and
the Transferring Subsidiaries, there are no  facts or conditions affecting
the Purchased Assets which could,  individually or in the aggregate,
interfere with the use, occupancy or  operation thereof as currently used,
occupied or operated, or their  adequacy for such use, except where the

not be reasonably likely  to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  CONTRACTS ---------  (l) As used herein, the term "Material

default (or event which with notice or lapse of  time or both would be a
default) by any of the Transferring  Subsidiaries has occurred thereunder
and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no  default (or event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would be a  default) by the other contracting parties has
occurred thereunder,  except for such defaults which in the aggregate are not
reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any
of  Seller\'s Affiliates (other than the Transferring Subsidiaries) are a 
party to any Material Contract on behalf of the Business.   (m) The
Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) all contracts,  leases (for real and
personal property), licenses and other instruments  which prohibit the

party thereto ("Third Party Consents"), and (ii)  each Third Party Consent
which involves a customer and an amount of  revenues exceeding $5.0 million
per year which, for the convenience of  the parties are identified on
Schedule 4.3(m)(ii) ("Material Third  Party Consents"). Except as provided in
the Disclosure Schedule,  neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and  Seller\'s Ancillary Documents by Seller, nor the
execution, delivery and  performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the  Subsidiary Ancillary Documents by the Transferring
Subsidiaries, nor  the consummation by Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries of the  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will (with
notice or  lapse of time or both) violate, conflict with or result in a
breach of  any of the terms, conditions or provisions of or result in (or
give any  party any right of) acceleration, termination or cancellation of
any of  the terms of any contract, lease, license, agreement, indenture, 
mortgage, debenture, note or other instrument related to the Business  or the
Purchased Assets, which violations, conflicts, or results would  in the
aggregate be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse  Effect.   (n)
The Disclosure Schedule (i) contains a list of all  material licenses,
permits, registration and governmental approvals  (the "Permits") (other than
Environmental Permits, which are  exclusively provided for in Section 4.3(y))

transferred or may not be  assigned to Purchaser without the consent of any
governmental authority  or any third party (the "Permit Consents") and (iii)
identifies each  Permit Consent required to be obtained on or before the
Closing Date  (the "Material Permits"). The Transferring Subsidiaries possess
all  Permits which are required in order for the Transferring Subsidiaries 
to conduct the Business as presently conducted, except where the  failure to
possess such Permits would not in the aggregate be  reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect.   20   INVENTORY ---------   (o) All
Inventories are of good, usable and merchantable quality,  except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule and except where, in the  aggregate, such
quality is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse  Effect, do not

the twelve-month period  ended December 31, 2000 and (b) the amount for which

such supplier  will not sell raw materials, supplies, merchandise and other
goods to  Purchaser at any time after the Closing Date on terms and
conditions  similar to those used in its current sales to the Business,

business and are, or will be,  collectible in full at the recorded amounts
thereof (net of any recorded  reserve) in the ordinary course of business
subject to no defenses,  setoffs, counterclaims or recoupments. Neither
Seller nor any Transferring  Subsidiary has any knowledge of any facts or
circumstances generally (other  than general economic conditions) which would
result in any increase in the  uncollectability of such receivables as a
class in excess of the reserves  therefor set forth on the Financial
Statements. The Disclosure Schedule  hereto accurately lists as of December
31, 2000 all receivables arising out  of or relating to the Business in

Transferring Subsidiaries  employed in the conduct of the Business:   (i)

Income Security Act of 1974, as  amended ("ERISA")) that are sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to  or required to be contributed to by the
Seller, a Transferring  Subsidiary or by any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated  (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with the Seller or
a  Transferring Subsidiary would be deemed a "single employer" within  the
meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, or to which Seller, a  Transferring
Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate is a party, whether  written or oral, for
the benefit of employees or former employees of  the U.S. Business. No
Pension Plan is a multiemployer plan (as  defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA);   (ii) the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete  list

Affiliate for the benefit of employees or  former employees of the U.S.
Business (the "Welfare Plans");   (iii) neither Danka US nor any ERISA
Affiliate of Danka US  has incurred any liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty  Corporation ("PBGC") as a result of the voluntary or involuntary 
termination of any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; there  is
currently no active filing by Danka US or any ERISA Affiliate with  the PBGC
(and no proceeding has been commenced by the PBGC) to  terminate any Pension
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA maintained or  funded, in whole or in part,
by Danka US or   22    any ERISA Affiliate; and neither Danka US nor any
ERISA Affiliate has  made a complete or partial withdrawal from a
multiemployer plan  resulting in withdrawal liability, as such term is
defined in Section  4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent reduction or
waiver of  such liability under either Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA); to 
Seller\'s knowledge, no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of  ERISA has
been incurred by Seller, a Transferring Subsidiary or any  ERISA Affiliate
that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition  exists that presents a
risk to Seller, a Transferring Subsidiary or  any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability, other than  liability for premiums due to the
PBGC (which premiums have been paid  when due) except where such liabilities
and conditions, in the  aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse  Effect. Insofar as the representation made in this
Section  4.3(t)(iii) applies to sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of 
ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, 
agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the  Seller, a
Transferring Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was  required to
make, contributions during the five (5)-year period  ending on the last day
of the most recent plan year ended prior to  the Closing Date;   (iv) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another  event, (i) entitle any current

ERISA Affiliate to worker\'s  compensation, severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other  payment or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or  increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
officer,  (iii) otherwise cause any payment of compensation to any such 
employee or officer to be treated as not deductible as an excess  parachute
payment under Section 280G(a) of the Code, or (iv)  constitute a "change in
control" triggering the payment of additional  benefits to any employee of
Seller, any Transferring Subsidiary or  any ERISA Affiliate;   (v) except
as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, no  Welfare Plan provides medical
coverage to former employees of the  Business (other than such coverage
required by Section 4980B(f) of  the Code and there has been no material
failure of a Welfare Plan  that is a group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the  Code) to meet the requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the
Code with  respect to a qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section 4980B(g)
of  the Code) except where such failures, in the aggregate, are not 
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to  the
U.S. Business, neither the Seller nor any Transferring Subsidiary  has
contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in  Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no ERISA Affiliate of the Seller or  any
Transferring Subsidiary has incurred a tax under Section 5000(a)  of the Code
which is or could become a liability of the Seller or a  Transferring

Section 2.3(i) (collectively, "Non-U.S.  Plans"), each Non-U.S. Plan is
listed on the Disclosure Schedule and  is in compliance with the provisions
of all laws applicable to each  such Non-U.S. Plan, and each Transferring
Subsidiary has accrued paid  contributions for or otherwise taken into
account on its books and  records all pension or retirement liabilities
required to be accrued,  contributed or otherwise taken into   23   
account under the laws applicable to each Non-U.S. Plan except where  such
non-compliance, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely  to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The plan assets for the Non-U.S.  Plans are, and on
the Closing Date will be, sufficient to satisfy all  vested accrued benefits
determined as if such plans terminated on the  Closing Date. The Transferring
Subsidiaries have filed, or will have  filed prior to the Closing Date, all
reports or other documents with  respect to each Non-U.S. Plan required by
the law applicable to each  such Non-U.S. Plan. Neither Seller nor any
Transferring Subsidiary  has made any communication that would limit
Purchaser\'s ability to  amend, modify or terminate any Non U.S. Plan to the
extent Purchaser  becomes obligated thereby;   (viii) except as set forth

is represented by a union  and there is no request for union representation
pending, or to  Seller\'s knowledge, threatened against any Transferring
Subsidiary  with respect to the Business;   (ix) There are no pending or,
to Seller\'s knowledge,  threatened, material unfair labor practice charges

Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all  employees of the Transferring
Subsidiaries employed in the conduct of  the Business ("Employees") as of the
Most Recent Fiscal Month End,  and said list correctly reflects their base
salaries, bonuses, dates  of employment positions, service date for employee
benefit purposes,  annual vacation entitlement, and such other information as
Purchaser  may reasonably request. Such list shall be made current as of
the  Closing Date. Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, none of 
the employees have contracts of employment with Seller or any  Transferring
Subsidiary. To the knowledge of Seller and any  Transferring Subsidiary, no
employee is subject to any contractual or  legal impediment to employment or
continued employment by Purchaser  after the Closing Date. All employees of
the US Business are  authorized to work for Seller and any Transferring
Subsidiary in  accordance with the Immigration and Reform Control Act and
Seller and  each Transferring Subsidiary has complied with the requirements
of  Executive Order 11246; and   (xi) except as set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, since  the enactment of the WARN Act, none of the Transferring
Subsidiaries  has effectuated a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined
in the  WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign law or regulation)

or operating units within any site of employment or  facility of the
Business, without complying with the WARN Act or  similar state, local or
foreign law or regulation, and, during the  ninety day period preceding the

Subsidiaries or, any of their respective  employees, officers or directors
with respect to or affecting the Business,  and except for those which, if
decided adversely to such party or the  applicable Transferring Subsidiary
would not, in the aggregate, be  reasonably likely to have a   24   
Material Adverse Effect. There is no such litigation, proceeding or 
investigation pending, or to Seller\'s knowledge, threatened, against Seller 
or its Affiliates or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries with respect to 
the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, or the use of the 
Purchased Assets (whether used by Purchaser after the Closing or by any of 
the Transferring Subsidiaries prior thereto).   (v) Neither Seller nor any
Transferring Subsidiary is a party to,  or bound by, any decree, order or
arbitration award (or agreement entered  into in any administrative, judicial
or arbitration proceeding with any  governmental authority) except for those

not had and are not  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

connection with the  Business, have not received any notice or order from any
governmental  agency or private or public entity advising them that they
are  responsible for or potentially responsible for Cleanup or paying for

facts which might reasonably give rise to  such notice, order, agreement or
responsibility.   (viii) None of the Transferring Subsidiaries, in
connection  with the Business, have entered into any contract, lease,

(vi) to Seller\'s and Transferring Subsidiaries\' knowledge,  the conduct of
the Business and the exercise of rights relating to  the Intellectual
Property does not infringe upon or otherwise  violate, intellectual property
rights of any person and neither the  Seller nor any Transferring Subsidiary
has received any notice of a  claim by a third party that the Intellectual

or trade  practice under laws of any jurisdiction;   (vii) to Seller\'s and
Transferring Subsidiaries\' knowledge,  no person is infringing upon or
otherwise violating any of the  Intellectual Property;   (viii) neither
Seller nor any Transferring Subsidiary has  received notice of any claims,

patent and registered  trademark and application therefor listed on the
Disclosure Schedule  is in proper form, not disclaimed and has been duly
maintained,  including the submission of all necessary filings in accordance
with  the legal and administrative requirements of the appropriate

(x) no Transferring Subsidiary has licensed or sublicensed  its rights in any

than pursuant to Intellectual Property  Licenses;   (xi) all Proprietary
Software set forth in the Disclosure  Schedule was either developed (a) by
employees of Seller or a  Transferring Subsidiary within the scope of their
employment and no  employee of Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary has any
claims or  rights in or to the Intellectual Property or to the transfer of
the  Intellectual Property to Purchaser, or (b) by independent contractors 
who have assigned their right to a Transferring Subsidiary pursuant  to
written agreements. Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary has  and enforces
a policy requiring each employee and contractor to  execute a proprietary
information/confidentiality agreement, and  substantially all current and
former employees and all consultants of  Seller and each Transferring
Subsidiary have executed such an  agreement; and   28    (xii) except as
set forth on the Disclosure Schedule, the  Transferring Subsidiaries have
full legal and beneficial right, title  and interest in and to, and have all
corporate power to sell or  transfer the Intellectual Property, the
Proprietary Software and the  Intellectual Property Licenses to
Purchaser.   As used herein "Software" means any and all (i) computer
programs,  including any and all software implementation of algorithms,
models and  methodologies whether in source code or object code and whether
embedded or  otherwise, (ii) databases and computations, including any and
all data and  collections of data, (iii) documentation, including user
manuals and  training materials, relating to any of the foregoing, and (iv)
the content  and information contained in any Web site which content and

Neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates, has dealt with any  person or
entity who is entitled to a broker\'s commission, finder\'s fee,  investment
banker\'s fee or similar payment from Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates for
arranging the transaction contemplated hereby or introducing  the parties to
each other.   (bb) Neither Seller nor any Transferring Subsidiary nor any of
its  directors, officers, agents, employees or any other persons acting on
its  behalf has, in connection with the operation of the Business, (i) used
any  corporate or other funds for unlawful contributions, payments, gifts
or  entertainment, or made any unlawful expenditures relating to political 
activity to government officials or established or maintained any unlawful 
or unrecorded funds in violation of Section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any other applicable foreign, federal 
or state law; or (ii) accepted or received any unlawful contributions, 
payments, expenditures or gifts.   (cc) (i) The continuance and final
success of Seller and each  Transferring Subsidiary will be enhanced on the
sale of the Purchased  Assets and the Business by Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries. The  sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser directly
benefits Seller in a net  amount greater than the contingent liability
assumed by Seller pursuant to  the terms of this Agreement. Seller
understands that Purchaser\'s  willingness to purchase the Purchased Assets
is predicated upon, and that  Purchaser has relied upon, the truth of the
foregoing representation by  Seller in agreeing to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.   (ii) Neither the Seller nor any Transferring Subsidiary
has  been party to a transaction pursuant to or as a result of which any  of
the Purchased Assets is liable to be transferred or re-transferred  to
another person or which gives or may give rise to a right of  compensation or
other payment in favour of another person. No  transaction at an undervalue
(a) relating to any of the shares in any  of the Transferring Subsidiaries,
or (b) to which Seller or any  Transferring Subsidiary has been a party, has
been effected prior to  the date of this Agreement. "Transaction at an
undervalue", in  relation to a company, has the meaning assigned by Section
238(4) of  the Insolvency Act 1986 and, in relation to an individual, has
the  meaning assigned by Section 339(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986.   (iii)
Seller further acknowledges that Purchaser\'s reliance on  Seller\'s
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement  is justified.  
(dd) After giving effect to the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby and the incurrence of any indebtedness in connection 
therewith, including, without limitation, contingent indebtedness, the fair 
market value of the assets of Seller and each Transferring   29   
Subsidiary will exceed the Seller\'s and each Transferring Subsidiary\'s 
respective aggregate liabilities.   (ee) After due investigation and
consideration, the Boards of  Directors of the Seller and each Transferring
Subsidiary have determined  that the Purchase Price represents the reasonably
equivalent value for the  Purchased Assets taken as a whole and the
allocation of the Purchase Price  among the Transferring Subsidiaries as set
forth on Schedule 3.2 is the  reasonably equivalent value of the Purchased
Assets owned by each of the  respective Transferring Subsidiaries after
conducting a noncollusive,  public "auction" of the Business to obtain the
highest purchase price for  the Purchased Assets. The Seller\'s Board of
Directors has been advised  during the auction process and in the negotiation
and execution of this  Agreement by Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin
Capital.   (ff) When (i) the proxy statement required to be provided under 
U.S. law (such proxy statement, in its definitive form, together with any 
and all amendments and supplements thereto and all information incorporated 
therein by reference therein being referred to as the "Proxy Statement") is 
mailed to Seller\'s shareholders and on the date of the shareholders\' 
meeting, the Proxy Statement shall contain all information required to be 
stated therein by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the 
rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
thereunder and shall in all material respects conform to the requirements  of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such rules and 
regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Proxy Statement shall not at  the
time it is mailed to Seller\'s shareholders and on the date of the 
shareholders\' meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements 
made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading and (ii) the circular required to be provided under the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority (such circular, in its definitive form, 
together with any and all amendments and supplements thereto being  hereafter
referred to as the "Circular") is mailed to Seller\'s shareholders  and on
the date of the shareholders\' meeting, the Circular shall contain  all
information required to be stated therein by the Listing Rules of the  UK
Listing Authority and shall in all material respects conform to the 
requirements of such Listing Rules, and the Circular shall not at the time 
it is mailed to Seller\'s shareholders and on the date of the shareholders\' 
meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state  any
material fact necessary in order to make statements made, in light of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   4.4 Limitation
on Warranties. Except as set forth in Section 4.3, Seller 
------------------------ makes no express or implied warranty of any kind
whatsoever, including, with respect to (a) any information furnished by
Seller or Transferring Subsidiaries or their financial advisor, or any of
Seller\'s or Transferring Subsidiaries\' other representatives or agents, (b)
the physical condition or value of any of the Purchased Assets or (c) the
future profitability or future earnings performance of the Business. ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except
to the extent specifically set forth in Section 4.3, Purchaser is acquiring
the Purchased Assets on an "as-is, where-is" basis.   4.5 Definition of
Knowledge. For the purposes of this Agreement, the 
----------------------- knowledge of Seller or of Seller and each
Transferring Subsidiary or of Seller and the Transferring Subsidiaries, or
the like, shall be deemed, in each case, to be and be limited to the actual
knowledge as of the Closing Date of one or more of the persons listed in
Schedule 4.5, which schedule details each such person\'s title or capacity,
in each case without giving effect to imputed knowledge but after reasonable
diligence and inquiry by such person in light of the circumstances under
which the representations are being made.   30    ARTICLE V   Conduct
Prior to the Closing   5.1 General. Seller and Purchaser shall have the
rights and obligations with respect to the period between the date hereof and
the Closing Date which are set forth in the remainder of this Article V.  
5.2 Seller\'s Obligations. The following are Seller\'s obligations: 
--------------------   (a) Subject to applicable law and privilege and
Section 5.3(d) below, Seller shall give, and shall cause the Transferring
Subsidiaries to give, to Purchaser\'s officers, employees, attorneys,
consultants, accountants and lenders reasonable access during normal business
hours to all of the properties, books, contracts, documents, records and
personnel of Seller and the Transferring Subsidiaries relating to the
Business and shall furnish to Purchaser such information, including all
internally prepared financial statements, as Purchaser may at any time and
from time to time reasonably request.   (b) Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts (and Purchaser shall cooperate with
Seller) to obtain the Governmental Consents, the Third Party Consents, the
Permit Consents and the Environmental Permit Consents. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall refrain from taking such actions with respect to any
such consents as may be expressly requested by Purchaser in writing and the
Purchaser shall have no recourse against Seller for Seller\'s compliance with
such written instructions from Purchaser, including any right to refuse to
close or to obtain a purchase price adjustment or indemnity.   (c) Seller
shall cause the Transferring Subsidiaries to carry on the Business in the
usual and ordinary course of business for profit motivated companies of
similar size and character, which shall require operating such business at
least consistent with past practices. Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary
shall use their reasonable best efforts to preserve intact their business
organizations and relationships with third parties and to keep available the
services of their present officers and employees. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary shall and shall cause
each Transferring Subsidiary, to:   (i) pay accounts payable and other
obligations of the Business when they become due and payable in the ordinary
course of business;   (ii) perform all of its obligations under
all contracts, agreements and instruments relating to or affecting the
Business or the Purchased Assets, and comply with all applicable laws;  
(iii) not enter into or assume any agreement, contract or instrument relating
to the Business, or enter into or permit any amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification in respect thereof, which Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries reasonably believe in the absence of breach and in the aggregate
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;   (iv) except
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, not grant
(or commit to grant) any increase in the compensation (including incentive or
bonus compensation) of any employee employed in the operation of the Business
or institute, adopt or amend (or commit to institute, adopt or amend) any
compensation or, subject to Section 5.2 (c) (iv), benefit plan, policy,
program or arrangement or collective bargaining agreement applicable to any
such employee;   (v) not institute, adopt or amend (or commit to institute,
adopt or amend) any severance pay plan, policy, program or arrangement
applicable to any employee employed in the Business;   31    (vi) not
change or otherwise amend the Credit Policy or its application other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and   (vii)
not take any action or omit to take any action which would result in a breach
of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3
(j).   (d) Seller shall, and shall cause the Transferring Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with Purchaser and any Affiliate of Purchaser to engage in such
discussions with the customers of the Business, as Purchaser may reasonably
request, relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.   (e) Subject to
the provisions of this paragraph (e), Seller shall, if required, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof (i) take all steps necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for
the purpose of securing the Shareholder Approval, (ii) distribute to its
shareholders the Circular and the Proxy Statement, (iii) use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to address comments from, and obtain clearance of,
the UK Listing Authority, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
other regulatory authorities, and (iv) subject to a good faith determination,
upon advice of outside counsel, that to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Purchaser will be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Circular and the Proxy Statement prior to submission to Seller\'s
shareholders (and, with respect to the Proxy Statement, prior to its initial
submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). The Circular and
the Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Seller in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent the Board
of Directors of Seller, in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2(e),
shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Circular and the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as practicable. If at
any time prior to the Closing Date any event with respect to any party or its
officers and directors or any of its subsidiaries shall occur that is
required to be described in the Circular and the Proxy Statement, the parties
will work together in good faith to ensure that such event shall be so
described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed
with the appropriate regulatory authorities and, as required by law,
disseminated to the shareholders of Seller.   (f) Subject to the provisions
of Section 5.2(g), nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller
or Seller\'s Board of Directors from taking any action or disclosing to
Seller\'s shareholders a position, or making a public disclosure, with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party for the share capital
of the Seller as required by applicable law or regulation including the City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers.   (g) Seller agrees that it shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Transferring Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee or any investment
banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of
Seller, or any of its respective Transferring Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Board of
Directors of Seller, as determined in good faith by a majority of the members
thereof (after consultation with outside legal counsel), Seller may, in
response to unsolicited requests therefor, participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish information pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement no less favorable to such party than the Confidentiality Letter to,
any person who indicates a willingness to make a Superior Proposal. Seller
immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions
or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.
Seller shall promptly notify   32   Purchaser upon becoming aware of the
existence or pending delivery of any Acquisition Proposal. For all purposes
of this Agreement, (y) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal for a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar
transaction involving Seller, or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries or any
proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in,
at least 15% of the voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the
assets of, Seller or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (z) "Superior Proposal" means
a bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire all of the
outstanding equity interests in or substantially all of the assets of Seller
or the Business, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a share
exchange, a sale of such assets or otherwise on terms which a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of Seller determines in good faith (taking
into account the advice of independent financial advisors) to be more
favorable to Seller and its shareholders than the transactions
contemplated hereby (and any revised proposal made by Purchaser to this
Agreement) and for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully
committed.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (a) any
of the following shall occur or exist: (i) the Shareholder Approval has not
been obtained and Seller enters into a definitive agreement within fifteen
months after the date of this Agreement in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) Seller\'s Board of Directors fails to recommend or withdraws,
modifies or changes in any manner adverse to Purchaser its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder,
(iii) Seller\'s Board of Directors takes any action described in paragraph
5.2 (f) which is in any manner adverse to Purchaser or (iv) Seller\'s Board
of Directors recommends an Acquisition Proposal (or Seller\'s Board of
Directors resolves to do any of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)), and (b) no Closing
occurs, Seller and the Transferring Subsidiaries, jointly and severally,
shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer within one business day after such
payment becomes due under this Section, a termination fee equal to
$6,250,000.   5.3 Purchaser\'s Obligations. The following are Purchaser\'s 
----------------------- obligations:   (a) Purchaser agrees that all
information supplied to it and its agents by Seller or its representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby has been, and will
hereafter through the Closing Date be, supplied pursuant to that certain
Confidentiality Letter dated as of January 12, 2001 entered into between
Purchaser and Seller (the "Confidentiality Letter") and that, notwithstanding
any provision of the Confidentiality Letter to the contrary regarding the
termination of such Confidentiality Letter upon the execution of a definitive
purchase agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Letter with respect to all such information from and after
the date hereof until the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (b) In the event that any Permit or Environmental Permit which is
to be assigned to Purchaser is not assignable, and Purchaser needs
such Permit or Environmental Permit in order to operate the Business,
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts (and Seller
shall cooperate with Purchaser) to obtain such Permit or Environmental Permit
at Seller\'s expense.   (c) Purchaser shall (i) use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain for the benefit of Seller unconditional
releases of the Transferring Subsidiaries\' respective obligations and
liabilities, and substitute and replace itself for any of the Transferring
Subsidiaries, under each surety, performance, fidelity or similar bond and
other similar obligation with respect to the Business in each case listed in
Schedule 5.3(c)  -------------- (collectively, the "Bonds") or (ii) if
unable to obtain the foregoing with respect to any Bond, use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain a back-up bond or insurance over each such
unreleased and/or unreplaced Bond, by issuers and in amounts reasonably
satisfactory to Seller, in order to assure Seller that it and the
Transferring Subsidiaries will have no obligations or liabilities under the
Bonds. Nothing herein contained shall relieve Purchaser of its liability
hereunder to duly and fully perform all obligations for which the Bonds were
given as security.   33    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.2(a) above, Purchaser shall not disrupt the operations of the Business
prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall not contact any customer or
employee of the Business without the approval of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and without the presence of a representative of the
Seller at any meeting if such presence is requested by Seller.   5.4 Joint
Obligations. The following shall apply with equal  ----------------- force
to Seller and Purchaser:   (a) Without implication that such laws apply to
the transaction contemplated hereby and without limitation of Section
10.2(d) hereof, each of Seller and Purchaser hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any laws relating to bulk sales.   (b) Seller, Purchaser and
all Transferring Subsidiaries shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain all available statutory or regulatory clearances or
exemptions from state and local sales, use and transfer taxes with respect to
the transfer of the assets purchased under the US Asset Purchase Agreement.
To the extent it is determined that clearances or proof of exemption cannot
be obtained from one or more of the relevant taxing authorities but the

Subsidiaries to record entries relating to the closing of Seller\'s and the

file Tax Returns related to the Business and to reconcile Intercompany
Accounts.   8.3 Certain Tax Matters. The parties understand and agree that 
------------------- this Agreement shall be interpreted, and that the parties
shall administer their dealings in relation to this Agreement, so as to
effect the following principles relating to Taxes:   (a) Purchaser shall be
responsible for (i) all Taxes arising out of the ownership and operation of
the Business beginning on the day after the Closing Date, (i) the Assumed
Property Taxes, (iii) sales, use and other transfer Taxes included in
invoices issued to Seller and the Transferring Subsidiaries that are Assumed
Liabilities, (iv) employment Taxes reflected in accrued employee expenses
that are Assumed Liabilities, (v) any other Tax identified as an Assumed
Liability in Section 2.2 of this Agreement and (vi) Sections 12.1 and
12.6.   39    (b) Except as set forth in Section 8.3(a), Seller and
the Transferring Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all Taxes arising out

Closing Date and shall be responsible for all Taxes of the Seller and its
Affiliates that do not arise out of the ownership and operation of the
business (except for Taxes imposed under Sections 12.1 and 12.6). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for sales, use and other transfer Taxes
included in Accounts Receivable that are Purchased Assets. Seller\'s and the
Transferring Subsidiaries\' responsibility for Taxes, as set forth above,
shall prevail irrespective of the manner in which any payment of Taxes or
obligation to pay Taxes (or the right to any credit, deposit or refund of
Taxes) is reflected in the financial statements of Seller and
the Transferring Subsidiaries.   (c) The party responsible for any Tax
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and (b) shall be entitled to all credits for and
deposits and refunds of such Tax.   (d) Any Tax refunds that are received
by Purchaser, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Purchaser becomes
entitled, that relate to Taxes as to which Purchaser was not responsible
shall be for the account of Seller, and Purchaser shall pay over to Seller
any such refund or the amount of any such credit (including interest) within
fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Purchaser agrees to
notify Seller promptly of both the discovery of a right to claim any such
refund, overpayment or prepayment and the receipt of any such refund or
utilization of any such overpayment or prepayment. Purchaser agrees (at
Seller\'s cost) to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment
or prepayment as soon as possible and to furnish Seller (at Seller\'s cost)
all information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of
such refund, overpayment or prepayment.   (e) Purchaser, each Transferring
Subsidiary and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section 8.3 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The parties agree to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, the Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. The
parties further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby). Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon
request, to provide the other party with all information that either party
may be required to report pursuant to the laws of any country.   (f) Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from, against and in respect of
any Taxes which are Excluded Liabilities and any Taxes for which the Seller
or the Transferring Subsidiary are responsible pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The limitations contained in Article X of this Agreement,
including but not limited to any limitations as to the time period and amount
of the indemnity, shall not apply to the indemnity provided hereunder.  
(g) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries from, against and in respect of any Taxes for which Purchaser is
responsible pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The limitations
contained in Article X of this Agreement, including but not limited to any
limitations as to the time period and amount of the indemnity, shall
not apply to the indemnity provided hereunder.   8.4 Use of Trademarks:
References to Seller. On the Closing Date, 
--------------------------------------- Seller and its Affiliates (including
the Transferring Subsidiaries) shall cease to use and shall not license or
permit any third party   40   to use any name, trade dress, service mark,
slogan, logo or trademark and the like which is confusingly similar to any of
the names, trade dress, slogans, logos, trademarks or service marks which
constitute Purchased Assets hereunder. Nothing set forth in this Agreement
shall prevent Seller or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries from using or
licensing to use the name and mark "Danka" and any name or mark incorporating
the name "Danka", including, any internet domain name using or incorporating
the name "Danka". Purchaser may refer to the Business as formerly being
Seller\'s for a period of one year following the Closing.   8.5 Payments of
Accounts Receivable and Other Items. In the event 
----------------------------------------------- Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferring Subsidiaries) shall receive any
instrument of payment of any of the accounts receivable of the Business,
Seller or such Affiliate shall promptly, and in any event within
five business days, deliver it to Purchaser, endorsed where necessary,
without recourse, in favor of Purchaser and, pending such delivery, shall
hold it in trust for Purchaser. In the event Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates shall receive any instrument of payment of any Excluded Asset or
other item related to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing Date
(including, but not limited to, any tax refund), Purchaser or such Affiliate
shall promptly, and in any event within five business days, deliver it to
Seller, endorsed where necessary, without recourse, in favor of Seller and,
pending such delivery, shall hold it in trust for Seller.   8.6 Third Party
Claims. The parties shall cooperate with each  ------------------ other with
respect to the defense of any Third Party Claims (as herein
defined) subsequent to the Closing Date which are not subject to the
indemnification provisions contained in Article X, provided that the party
requesting cooperation shall reimburse the other party for the other party\'s
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of furnishing such
cooperation.   8.7 Insurance.  ---------   (a) Seller will provide
Purchaser, not less than thirty (30) days prior to Closing, a schedule of

each policy for the current year. Purchaser is responsible for all events or
circumstances that first exist or occur after the Closing or Foreign Closing,
as the case may be, and that relate to the Purchased Assets or the
Business.   8.8 Certain Contract Matters Seller and each Transferring 
------------------------ Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to provide to, or to facilitate providing to, Purchaser the
remaining benefits, rights and claims (but not the obligations) to which the
Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary is entitled under that certain Asset

6, 1996, as the same has been modified, amended or otherwise supplemented, to
the extent, and solely for the extent, such benefits relate to the portion of
the Business being transferred hereunder.   8.9 Seller\'s Confidentiality.
Seller and each Transferring  ------------------------ Subsidiary shall
treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all information, knowledge
and data included in the Purchased Assets by using the same degree of care,
but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized
use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as
Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary used with respect thereto prior to
the execution of this Agreement.   41    8.10 Use of Seller\'s
Trademarks. Purchaser may continue to use, until 
-------------------------- exhausted, but in no event more than six months
following the Closing Date, the supplies of stationery, invoices, order
forms, packaging material and the like which are on hand as of the Closing
Date which bear any of Seller\'s or its Affiliates\' trademarks or service
marks which are not included in the Purchased Assets or the Intellectual
Property, as long as Purchaser shall affix thereto a sticker or stamp
indicating Purchaser\'s ownership of the Business. Seller and each
Transferring Subsidiary shall facilitate an electronic high speed link
from their website(s) to the website(s) of Purchaser for a period of six
months following the Closing.   8.11 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.
In furtherance of the sale  ------------------------------------ of the
Purchased Assets and the Business to Purchaser hereunder by virtue of
the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller covenants and agrees that, none
of Seller nor any of its Affiliates including the Transferring Subsidiaries
will (nor will Seller or any of its Affiliates join with any third party in
any joint venture or alliance to or which) for a period ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date:   (a) induce or attempt to persuade any
customer of the Business as of the Closing Date or prospective customer of
the Business to which the Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary has made a
proposal to provide services or from which Seller or any Transferring
Subsidiary has received a proposal relating to services during the period
commencing ninety days prior to the Closing Date to terminate or fail to
renew or continue or enter such business relationship with the Business;  
(b) engage in a business included within the definition of "Business"
anywhere in the world, whether such engagement shall be as owner, partner,
agent, consultant or shareholder (except as the holder of not more than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of an entity whose equity
securities are listed on any national, regional or foreign securities
exchange or reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System or any successor thereto); or   (c) solicit the
employment of or hire or engage in any discussion with any current or former
officer or key employee of Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary with respect
to the Business or any person who is an officer or key employee of Purchaser
whose primary employment duties are with respect to Purchaser\'s operation of
the Business, in each case while such person is in the employ of Purchaser or
its Affiliates.  Except as provided in Article IX, Purchaser covenants and
agrees that, without implication that the contrary would otherwise be true,
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall solicit the employment of or hire or engage in any
discussion with any person who is an officer or key employee of Seller or any
Transferring Subsidiary of Seller, while such person is in the employ of
Seller or any subsidiary; provided, however, in the event that Seller or any
of its Affiliates enters bankruptcy, voluntarily or otherwise, or otherwise
becomes insolvent, the provisions of this sentence shall be terminated and be
of no effect. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly agree upon schedules of the
officers and key employees covered by the immediately preceding sentence and
clause (c) of this Section 8.11, such schedules to be delivered at the
Closing. Such schedules may include job titles or classifications rather than
names. Where names are indicated such clause shall also cover replacements of
such individuals during the twelve month period immediately following the
Closing as the parties shall advise each other from time to time. The term
"solicitation" as used in such sentence and such clause shall not include
solicitations which are not targeted at particular individuals, such as "help
wanted" advertising. This Section shall survive the Closing. Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8.11, including the
periods of restriction, the geographical areas of restriction and the
restraints imposed are fair and reasonably required for the protection of the
other party hereto. In the event that any of the provisions of this Section
8.11 relating to the geographic areas of restriction or the periods of
restriction shall be deemed to exceed the maximum area or period of
time which a court of competent jurisdiction would deem enforceable, the
geographic areas and times shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be
deemed to be the maximum areas or time periods which a court of competent
jurisdiction would deem valid and enforceable in any state in which such
court of competent jurisdiction   42   shall be convened. Each party
hereto acknowledges that any breach of its obligations under this Section
8.11 may result in irreparable injury to the other party hereto, for which
such other party may not have an adequate remedy at law. In the event of any
such breach, the non-breaching party may, in its sole discretion and in
addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action or actions
against the breaching party for injunctive relief, specific performance or
both, and seek to have entered a temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction, or order compelling specific performance. The
prevailing party in any action seeking to enforce the provisions of
this Section 8.11 shall obtain reimbursement of its actual costs and
attorneys\' fees in connection with such action. If Seller merges with or is
acquired by any consolidated group that has revenues for its last fiscal year
in excess of $500,000,000 and is engaged at the time of such acquisition, in
a business competitive with the Business, then this Section 8.11 shall
immediately terminate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent Seller and
its Affiliates from, directly or indirectly, selling or seeking to sell
office equipment at any customer locations or otherwise or continuing to
conduct their respective businesses, other than the Business, as such
businesses are being conducted as of the Closing Date. As used herein, "key
employee" shall mean with respect to the Seller and the Transferring
Subsidiaries, any person with a job classification set forth on Schedule
8.11(a) and with respect to Purchaser, any person with a job classification

of Seller\'s U.S. and Canadian Employees. 
-------------------------------------------------- On the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall offer to employ or to continue to employ as of the Closing
Date each Affected Employee in comparable positions, at compensation and upon
terms and conditions which are in the aggregate no less favorable to the
Affected Employee than the position, compensation or terms and conditions in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that each such offer  --------
------- of employment or continued employment is subject to the Affected
Employee satisfying Purchaser\'s Hiring Criteria. Purchaser shall not take
any action which would result in Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary having
any liability under the WARN Act or any similar federal, state or local law.
As used herein, "Hiring Criteria" shall mean satisfaction of Purchaser\'s
generally applicable employment policies and procedures, including, as
applicable to the particular job, completion of a standard employment
application, satisfactory completion of a background check and demonstration
of proper authorization to work under the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 ("IRCA") or any comparable applicable Canadian law. Purchaser
represents and warrants that the Hiring Criteria comply with all applicable
laws. Except for voluntary resignations and deaths, Purchaser shall continue
to employ each Transferred Employee until at least the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, but may at any time terminate any Transferred Employee for
cause or as a result of failure to satisfy Purchaser\'s Hiring Criteria. In
the event Purchaser terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date for any reason other than
cause or failure to satisfy the applicable Hiring Criteria, Purchaser shall
pay to such terminated Transferred Employee a lump-sum severance amount equal
to the severance amount to which such Transferred Employee would be entitled
under Purchaser\'s severance policy in effect as of the Closing Date.   (b)
Welfare Benefits.  ----------------   (i) Seller and its applicable
Transferring Subsidiaries shall be solely liable for all claims and

shall, at no expense to Seller or Danka US, provide the benefits, if any,
required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or the comparable Canadian law, if any, as the case may be,
for any Transferred Employee who is or becomes entitled to such continuation
with respect to the Business from Seller, Danka US, Danka Canada I, Danka
Canada II, or Purchaser at any time.   (ii) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.1(e), from and after the Closing and continuing until the
Applicable Benefit Changeover Date, Purchaser shall provide Transferred
Employees with welfare and fringe benefits substantially equivalent, in the
aggregate, to those in effect with respect to the Transferred Employees on
the day before the Closing and all applicable waiting periods and pre-
existing conditions under such benefits shall be waived with respect to
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents who were participants in
a comparable welfare plan of Seller or a Transferring Subsidiary on the date
before the Closing Date, to the extent permitted under the terms of the
applicable welfare plan and/or required by applicable law. On and after the
Applicable Benefit Changeover Date, Purchaser shall for a period of one year
provide all Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
and beneficiaries with the same or substantially equivalent welfare and
fringe benefits then being provided to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser, if any but in no event, shall   44   such benefits in the
aggregate be less generous than the least generous welfare and fringe
benefits, if any, provided to U.S. or Canadian employees of Purchaser, and
its affiliates.   (iii) Purchaser shall continue the incentive bonus plans
or arrangements in effect on the day before the Closing for the remainder of
the plan year in which the Closing occurs and shall cause benefits to

plan on the day before the Closing in an amount which is no less than the
amount which is actually earned under the terms of the applicable incentive
bonus plan or arrangement as in effect on the day before the Closing for such
plan year. All payments under this paragraph (c) shall be made as required by
the terms of the applicable plan as in effect on the Closing Date.   (iv)
For purposes of this Agreement, "Applicable Benefit Changeover Date" shall
mean, with respect to each pension, welfare or fringe benefit plan applicable
to Transferred Employees, the day elected by the Purchaser, which may be any
day on or after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, but in no event
later than January 1, 2004.   (c) Service Crediting. Effective as of the
Closing Date,  ----------------- Purchaser will count the service of all
Transferred Employees with Seller, its Transferring Subsidiaries, and their
Affiliates and all service credited by Seller, its Transferring Subsidiaries
or its Affiliates (including service of Transferred Employees with Eastman
Kodak Company and its Affiliates to which such persons have received credit
with Seller, its Transferring Subsidiaries and their Affiliates for purposes
of such policies and plans) under Purchaser\'s vacation policy and welfare
benefit plans applicable to such Transferred Employees. In addition, such
service shall be counted by Purchaser in determining each Transferred
Employee\'s eligibility to participate in, and each such Transferred
Employee\'s vested percentage in, each of Purchaser\'s employee benefit plans
(as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) applicable to such Transferred
Employee, but not for benefit accrual purposes.   (d) Pension Plans. 
-------------   (i) From and after the Closing and continuing until the
Applicable Benefit Changeover Date:   (1) Purchaser shall provide
Transferred Employees participating in the Danka Corporation 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan ("Seller\'s 401(k) Plan") with an individual account pension
plan with a cash or deferred arrangement meeting Section 401(k) of the Code
("Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan") substantially equivalent to Seller\'s 401(k)
Plan in effect with respect to the Transferred Employees on the day before
the Closing. Such Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan shall include such provisions as
may be necessary or appropriate to receive "rollover" or "direct rollover"
contributions of cash (including the cash proceeds of any in-kind
distributions) from Transferred Employees entitled to receive a distribution
from Seller\'s 401(k) Plan on account of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (2) Purchaser shall provide
Transferred Employees other than those employed by Danka US or participating
in Seller\'s 401(k) Plan, with pension benefits substantially equivalent, in
the aggregate, to those in effect with respect to such Transferred Employees
on the day before the Closing.   (ii) On and after the Applicable
Benefit Changeover Date, Purchaser shall for a period of one year provide
Transferred Employees with the same or substantially equivalent employee
pension benefit plans, if any, as are then provided to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser, but in no event shall such benefits in the aggregate
be less generous than the least generous employee pension benefit plans, if
any, provided to U.S. and Canadian employees of Purchaser, and its
affiliates.   45    (e) Vacation. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser  -------- shall grant vacation days or hours determined under the
applicable Transferring Subsidiary\'s vacation program applicable to each
Transferred Employee. The vacation days or hours granted by Purchaser
hereunder for the vacation computation period which includes the Closing Date
(after taking into account vacation days taken prior to the Closing Date with
respect to the same vacation computation period) shall be provided under a
program no more restrictive than the vacation policy of Purchaser.   9.2
Post-Closing Covenants Relating to Seller\'s Non-U.S. and 
-------------------------------------------------------- Non-Canadian
Employees. The following provision relates solely to
Affected ---------------------- Employees other than those employed by Danka
US, Danka Canada I and Danka Canada II. In the case of the Affected Employees
of each of the Transferring Subsidiaries other than Danka US, Danka Canada I
and Danka Canada II, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume (by
operation of law or otherwise) the contracts of employment of all such
Affected Employees with effect from the Closing Date in accordance with and
to the extent required by the Acquired Rights Directive (as defined below)
insofar as it has been adopted by local law. As used herein, "Acquired Rights
Directive" means Council Directive 77/187/EEC on the approximation of the
laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees\' rights
in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses
and/or any legislation or regulation implementing that directive in any
member state. The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that under
the Acquired Rights Directive, the contracts of employment between the Seller
or the applicable Transferring Subsidiary and the Affected Employees will
have effect after Closing as if originally made between the Purchaser and the
Affected Employees. The Purchaser shall comply with its respective
obligations pursuant to the Acquired Rights Directive and shall indemnify the
Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary against any claims and costs
(including legal costs) for breach thereof, insofar as such breach arises out
of the Purchaser\'s failure to comply with its respective
obligations thereunder.   9.3 Relation to Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding any other  -------------------------------- provision of
Sections 9.1 or 9.2 , the rights and benefits of the employees of each of the
Transferring Subsidiaries shall be dealt with in accordance with the detailed
provisions of the relevant Ancillary Agreement if and to the extent there is
any conflict between the provisions of Sections 9.1 or 9.2 and any
such Ancillary Agreement   9.4 Liabilities Accrued Prior to Closing. Except
as provided in  ------------------------------------ Section 9.1(b), as
required by the Acquired Rights Directive in so far as it has been adopted by
local law or as reflected on the Audited Balance Sheet, all liabilities and
expenses owed to Transferred Employees, which are incurred prior to the
Closing Date or relate to any period prior to the Closing Date, will be paid
to such Transferred Employee by the applicable Transferring Subsidiary prior
to the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter; provided, however,
that any vested accrued benefits under any Pension Plan of Seller or any
Transferring Subsidiary shall be paid in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the applicable Pension Plan, but nothing in this Section
9.4 shall require payment of benefits prior to the time required by the
applicable Pension Plan. Each Affected Employee who has actually commenced
employment with the Purchaser is hereinafter referred to individually as a
"Transferred Employee" and collectively as "Transferred Employees."  
ARTICLE X   Indemnification.  ---------------   10.1 General. From and

by virtue of:   (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
and warranty made by Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary in this Agreement

condition existing on or prior to the Closing Date, or (C) related to any

shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Article III,
and that, in each case, such adjustment shall be allocated to the assets
purchased under the Ancillary Agreement to which the recovery relates.

entitled to recover under Section 10.3 until the total amount which Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under Section 10.3 and the Seller Indemnitees shall
not be entitled to recover under Section 10.4 until the total amount which
Seller Indemnitees would recover under Section 10.4, but for this Section

to the limitation contained in this Section 10.5(b);   (c) the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under Section 10.3 and the

subject matter covered by such representations and warranties and claims
relating to the Excluded Liabilities, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the representations or warranties set forth in Sections 4.3(a)
and 4.3(c) may be brought at any time; provided, further, that, if a claim or

date, the right to indemnification in connection with such claim
shall continue indefinitely until such claim and right to indemnification is
finally resolved;   (d) the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to

matters);   (e) the amount of any recovery by the Indemnitees pursuant to
Sections 10.3 and 10.4 shall be net of any foreign, federal, state and/or

of facts which entitled the Indemnitees to recover; provided, however, that
any such income tax benefit shall be netted against such recovery only
upon the actual economic realization of such benefit to the Indemnitees. For
purposes of this Section 10.5(f), a tax benefit shall be economically
realized at the time and to the extent that either (i) the tax cost to the
Indemnitee is reduced by reason of such state of facts, or (ii) the
Indemnitee receives a tax refund by reason of such state of facts.   10.6
Cooperation. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.7, the 
----------- Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, and if said right is
exercised, the parties shall cooperate in the investigation and defense of
said Third Party Claim.   10.7 Third Party Claims. Promptly following the
receipt of notice  ------------------ of a Third Party Claim, the party
receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall (i) notify the other
party of its existence setting forth in writing and with reasonable
specificity the facts and circumstances of which such party has received
notice, and (ii) if the party giving such notice is an Indemnified Party,
specifying in writing the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Party\'s
claim for indemnification is asserted. The Indemnified Party may,
upon reasonable notice, tender the defense of a Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party. If within thirty (30) days after the date on which
written notice of a Third Party Claim has been given pursuant to this Section
10.7, the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge its indemnification
obligations as provided in this Article X in writing to the Indemnified Party
and accept the defense thereof (provided, that, if the Indemnifying Party
does not accept the defense of such Third Party Claim, it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party in sufficient time such that it is not prejudiced thereby),
then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnified Party shall not, and
the Indemnifying Party shall, have the right to contest, defend, litigate or
settle such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
be represented by counsel at its own expense in any such contest, defense,
litigation or settlement conducted by the Indemnifying Party provided that
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to reimbursement therefor if the
Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and
settle the Third Party Claim as herein provided. The Indemnifying Party shall
lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle the Third Party Claim
if it shall fail to diligently contest the Third Party Claim. So long as the
Indemnifying Party has not lost its right and/or obligation to contest,
defend, litigate and settle as herein provided, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the Third Party
Claim and shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion exercised in good
faith, and upon the advice of counsel, to settle any such matter, either
before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such
terms as it deems fair and reasonable, provided that at least ten (10) days
prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle shall
be given to the Indemnified Party; provided, further, that, (i) Seller shall
not agree to any settlement that affects the Business, the manner in which it
is conducted following the Closing, requires the Purchaser to take or allow
any action or otherwise affects the Purchaser, without Purchaser\'s consent
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party will not have the exclusive right to conduct
the defense if under applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict
on any   49   significant issue between the Indemnifying Party and any
Indemnified Party exists in respect of such claim, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel to be retained in connection with the
Indemnified Party\'s defense in order to resolve such conflict, promptly upon
presentation by the Indemnified Party of invoices or other documentation
evidencing such amounts to be reimbursed. All expenses (including without
limitation attorneys\' fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection
with the foregoing shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. No failure by an
Indemnifying Party to acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations
under this Article X shall relieve it of such obligations to the extent they
exist. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification against a Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party fails to accept a tender of, or
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the second sentence of
this Section 10.7, or if, in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle such a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, without
prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in its discretion
exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to contest, defend
and litigate such Third Party Claim, and may settle such Third Party Claim,
either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon
such terms as the Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable, provided that
at least ten (10) days prior to any such settlement, written notice of
its intention to settle is given to the Indemnifying Party. If, pursuant to
this Section 10.7, the Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or
settles a Third Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, as hereinabove provided, the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed
by the Indemnifying Party for the reasonable attorneys\' fees and other
expenses of defending, contesting, litigating and/or settling the Third Party
Claim which are incurred from time to time, forthwith following the
presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for said attorneys\'
fees and other expenses.   10.8 Tax Indemnities. In the case of any
indemnity relating to  --------------- Taxes, the person against which the
taxing jurisdiction asserts liability (whether as taxpayer, transferee or
otherwise) shall be responsible for handling and controlling all
administrative proceedings and litigation relating to such Taxes. If the
taxing authority asserts liability against both parties, the Indemnitee shall
be responsible for handling and controlling administrative proceedings and
litigation relating to such Taxes. At its own expense, the Indemnitor shall
have the right to participate in any proceedings so controlled by the
Indemnitee and to review all correspondence with the taxing
authority relating to such proceedings. The Indemnitee shall not settle any
such matter without the prior consent of the Indemnitor, but the Indemnitor
shall not unreasonably withhold such consent.   10.9 Indemnification
Exclusive Remedy.  --------------------------------   (a) Except for claims
or causes of action based on fraud, as provided in this Section 10.9 and as
provided in Sections 8.3, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
Article X shall following the Closing be the exclusive remedy of the parties
for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty or covenant contained
herein or in any closing document executed and delivered pursuant to the
provisions hereof. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
following the Closing, no legal action sounding in tort or strict liability
may be maintained by any party hereto (or a Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee not a party hereto) against any other party hereto with respect to
any matter that is the subject of this Article X (excluding with respect to
the failure to discharge any Excluded Liability).   (b) The limitations
contained in Section 10.5 and 10.9(a) shall not apply to: (i) claims by
Purchaser pursuant to Sections 10.3 (c) or (ii) claims by the Seller pursuant
to Section 10.4(c).   (c) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Purchaser is relying in particular on the covenants set forth in Sections 8.9
and 8.11 in executing and delivering this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement and consummating the transactions hereunder and thereunder. Seller
acknowledges that any breach of Sections 8.9 or 8.11 would give rise to
irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.
Seller accordingly agrees that in addition to other remedies, Purchaser  
50   shall be entitled to enforce the terms of Sections 8.9 and 8.11 by
decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief
against any breach or threatened breach of Sections 8.9 or 8.11   ARTICLE
XI   Effect of Termination/Proceeding  --------------------------------  
11.1 General. The parties shall have the rights and remedies with 
------- respect to the termination and/or enforcement of this Agreement which
are set forth in this Article XI.   11.2 Right to Terminate. This Agreement
and the transactions  ------------------ contemplated hereby may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by the mutual written
consent of Purchaser and Seller;   (b) by either of such parties if the
Closing shall not have occurred at or before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on
June 30, 2001 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that either the
Seller or the Purchaser  -------- ------- shall have the unilateral right to
extend the Termination Date for three successive one-month periods if the
conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 6.1(d), 6.2(c), 6.2(e), 6.3(b)
and 6.3(d) have not been satisfied and further;  ------- provided, that, the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.2(b) --------
---- shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the aforesaid date;  
(c) by the party entitled to the benefit thereof, if any condition set forth
in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 shall become impossible to fulfill;   (d) by
either Seller or Purchaser if the Shareholder Approval shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required number of votes to
approve the transactions contemplated hereby upon the taking of such vote at
a duly held meeting of stockholders of the Seller or at any adjournment
thereof;   (e) by Purchaser if there is a material adverse change in the
condition, financial or otherwise, or operations of the Business, taken as
a whole; or   (f) by either Seller or Purchaser if the other party or, in
the case of the Purchaser, any Transferring Subsidiary, shall
enter, voluntarily or otherwise, bankruptcy.  In the event the Purchaser
desires to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.2(c) by reason of
a failure to satisfy the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a),
the Purchaser shall have no such right to terminate until the aggregate
liability arising out of all breaches of representations and warranties
causing such failure to satisfy the condition exceeds $1,250,000, and in any
event, the Seller shall have thirty days from Purchaser\'s written notice of
intent to terminate to: (i) cure the relevant breach; (ii) retain or
assume the liability arising out of the breach; or (iii) pay the Purchaser an
amount to make the Purchaser whole for such breach.  The party desiring to
terminate this Agreement shall give prompt written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 12.3.   11.3 Certain Effects
of Termination. In the event of the 
------------------------------ termination of this Agreement by either Seller
or Purchaser as provided in Section 11.2, (i) each party, if so requested by
the other party, will return promptly (or otherwise deal with as permitted
under the Confidentiality Letter) every   51   document furnished to it
by the other party (or any subsidiary, division, associate or Affiliate of
such other party) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby,
whether so obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement, and any
copies thereof (except for copies of documents publicly available) which may
have been made, and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause its representatives and any representatives of financial institutions
and investors and others to whom such documents were furnished promptly to
return such documents and any copies thereof any of them may have made, and
(ii) the Confidentiality Letter shall remain in effect notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained therein with respect to the execution
of a definitive purchase agreement. This Section 11.3 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.   11.4 Remedies. Notwithstanding any
termination right granted in  -------- Section 11.2, in the event of the
nonfulfillment of any condition to a party\'s closing obligations, in the
alternative, such party may elect to do one of the following:   (a) proceed
to close despite the nonfulfillment of any closing condition, it being
understood that consummation of the Closing shall be deemed a waiver of each
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant and of such party\'s
rights and remedies with respect thereto to the extent that such party shall
have actual knowledge of such breach, shall execute a written consent thereto
and shall nonetheless proceed to the Closing;   (b) decline to close,
terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 11.2, and thereafter seek
damages to the extent permitted in Section 11.5 or Section 5.2; or   (c)
seek specific performance of the obligations of the other party. Each party
hereby agrees that in the event of any breach by such party of this
Agreement, the remedies available to the other party at law would be
inadequate and that such party\'s obligations under this Agreement may
be specifically enforced.   11.5 Right to Damages. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  ---------------- Section 11.2, neither party hereto
shall have any claim against the other except as provided in Section 5.2 or
if the circumstances giving rise to such termination were caused by the other
party\'s intentional breach of the representations, warranties or covenants
set forth herein, in which event termination pursuant to Section 11.2 shall
not be deemed or construed as limiting or denying any legal or equitable
right or remedy of said party.   ARTICLE XII   Miscellaneous 
-------------   12.1 Sales and Transfer Taxes. Purchaser shall pay all
excise,  ------------------------ stamp and transfer and conveyance taxes
and customary duties arising in connection with and as a consequence of the
sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets and the Business to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.   12.2 Publicity. Except as otherwise required
by law or applicable  --------- stock exchange rules, press releases
concerning this transaction shall be made only with the prior written consent
of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and, in any
event, Seller and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to consult and agree with each other with respect to the content of
any such required press release). In addition, with respect to any other
written publicity related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise related to any party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries
(including, the Transferring Subsidiaries) and/or their respective businesses
(including, the Business), each party agrees not to (and agrees to cause its
Affiliates not to) disparage the other in any publicity.   12.3 Notices. All
notices required or permitted to be given  ------- hereunder shall be in
writing and may be delivered by hand, by facsimile or by an overnight courier
nationally recognized in the United   52   States (a "nationally
recognized overnight courier"). Notices delivered by hand, by facsimile or by
a nationally recognized overnight courier shall be deemed given on the date

after its delivery by facsimile. All notices shall be addressed

Telecopier: 212-309-6273  ------------  and/or to such other respective
addresses and/or addressees as may be designated by notice given in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.3.   12.4 Expenses. Except
as set forth in Articles X or XI, each of Seller and  -------- Purchaser
shall bear all fees and expenses incurred by such party (and by each such
party\'s respective subsidiaries) in connection with, relating to or
arising out of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, including,
financial advisors\', attorneys\',   53   accountants\' and other
professional fees and expenses, provided, however, that Purchaser and Seller
shall each pay one-half of the fees required in connection with any filing
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any European Filing. For the
purposes of this Section 12.4, fees and expenses incurred by any Transferring
Subsidiary shall be deemed to have been incurred by Seller.   12.5 Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchaser\'s Ancillary 
---------------- Documents, Seller\'s Ancillary Documents, the Subsidiary
Ancillary Documents and the Ancillary Agreements (the Purchaser\'s Ancillary
Documents, Seller\'s Ancillary Documents, the Subsidiary Ancillary Documents
and the Ancillary Agreements together being referred to herein as the
"Ancillary Materials") constitute the entire agreement between the parties
and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement and the Ancillary Materials constitute a single agreement
among the parties and contemplate a single, integrated transaction. The
Disclosure Schedule being delivered simultaneously herewith shall be deemed
to constitute exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.3 to the extent specified in Section 4. Each other exhibit and
schedule shall be considered incorporated into this Agreement and the
Ancillary Materials. The inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedule is
not evidence of the materiality of such item for the purposes of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Materials. The parties make no representations or
warranties to each other, except as contained in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Materials, and any and all prior representations and warranties
made by any party or its representatives, whether verbally or in writing, are
deemed to have been merged into this Agreement and the Ancillary Materials,
it being intended that no such prior representations or warranties shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Materials. Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted an
independent investigation of the financial condition, assets, liabilities,
properties and projected operations of the Business in making its
determination as to the propriety of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Materials, and in entering into this Agreement
and the Ancillary Materials it has relied solely on the results of said
investigation and on the representations and warranties of Seller expressly
contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, Subsidiary Ancillary
Documents and Seller\'s Ancillary Documents delivered pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. In connection with its investigation of the
Business, Purchaser received from or on behalf of Seller certain estimates,
forecasts, plans and financial projections. Purchaser acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, forecasts,
plans and projections, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties,
that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, forecasts, plans and projections
so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, forecasts, plans and projections), and that
Purchaser shall have no claim against Seller or any Transferring
Subsidiary with respect thereto. Accordingly, neither Seller nor any
Transferring Subsidiary makes any representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, forecasts, plans and projections (including any such
underlying assumptions).   12.6 Value Added Taxes.  -----------------  
(a) All sums stated in this Agreement as being payable by Purchaser to the
Transferring Subsidiaries or vice versa shall be deemed to be exclusive of
any VAT, which may be chargeable on the supply or supplies for which such
sums (or any part thereof) are the whole or part of the consideration for VAT
purposes.   (b) The Transferring Subsidiaries and Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts (which shall include, providing
each other with such information or assistance as the other shall reasonably
request) to ensure that the transfer of the Business and the Purchased Assets
under this Agreement is treated under Article 5(8) of the Sixth Directive
(where applicable) or any other applicable legislation made pursuant to, or
derived from, such Article (such as Article 5 of the VAT (Special Provisions)
Order 1995 in the United Kingdom) or such other legislation as is applicable
in a country which is not a member state of the European Union as not being a
supply of goods (or a supply of services) for VAT purposes.   54    (c)
Seller and Purchaser shall agree whether or not to make an application to any
relevant Tax authority for a confirmatory declaration that VAT is not
chargeable on the transfer of the Business and/or the Purchased Assets under
the relevant Ancillary Agreement. If the parties agree to make such an
application, Seller shall procure the submission (as soon as
possible following the aforementioned agreement) by the relevant Transferring
Subsidiary to its relevant Tax authority of such an application. If,
notwithstanding the commercially reasonable best efforts of the relevant
Transferring Subsidiary, an amount of VAT is determined in writing by a Tax
authority to be payable in respect thereof (or in respect of a transfer of
the Business or Purchased Assets for which an application is not made), then
Seller shall notify Purchaser of that determination forthwith. For the
avoidance of doubt, this subsection (c) shall not affect the application of
Subsection (e) below.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Ancillary Agreements, if Purchaser disagrees with any
determination of any Tax authority that VAT is chargeable, it may, within 5
business days of being so notified, give notice to Seller that it requires
Seller to obtain a review by the relevant Tax authority of that determination
and the relevant Transferring Subsidiary shall forthwith request the Tax
authority, to undertake that review; provided however that concurrent with
notification of such disagreement to the relevant Transferring Subsidiary,
Purchaser shall furnish such Transferring Subsidiary with an opinion of
independent legal counsel of national repute in the relevant member state of
the European Union or Norway (as applicable) in support of Purchaser\'s
contention that VAT is not so chargeable. Notwithstanding receipt of such
opinion of independent legal counsel, Seller may nonetheless invoice
Purchaser for VAT, and Purchaser shall promptly pay such amount
(for subsequent reimbursement if recovered by the relevant Transferring
Subsidiary). Upon the relevant Transferring Subsidiary being advised by the
relevant Tax authority of the decision arising out of that review, Seller
shall forthwith notify Purchaser thereof. If Purchaser disagrees with that
decision, it may give notice to Seller to make an appeal against the decision
of the relevant Tax authority (an "Appeal") in a manner as Purchaser shall
reasonably request or Purchaser may itself make an Appeal as it shall
consider appropriate with such assistance from Seller as Purchaser shall
reasonably request. If as a result of the Appeal an amount of VAT is still
deemed chargeable and has not yet been paid by the Purchaser, then Purchaser
shall forthwith pay over to the relevant Transferring Subsidiary the amount
of VAT chargeable in accordance with paragraph (e) below, together with any
interest, penalties and fines payable in relation thereto upon receipt of a
valid VAT invoice.   (e) Where, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
one party (the "Supplying Party") makes a supply to the other (the "Paying
Party") for VAT purposes, and (notwithstanding subsection (b) above) VAT is
or becomes properly chargeable on such supply, the Paying Party shall within
two (2) days prior to the date on which the Supplying Party is obliged to
account for such sum to the relevant Tax authority, pay to the Supplying
Party (in addition to any other consideration for such supply) a sum equal to
the amount of such VAT (and the Supplying Party will at the time of such
payment provide the Paying Party with a valid tax invoice in respect of such
supply from the Supplying Party.)   (f) In this Section 12.6:   (i) "VAT"
means value added tax as provided for in Article 2, EC Council Directive
67/227 (First Council Directive of 11 April 1967 on the harmonization of
legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes) or any legislation
made pursuant thereto or derived therefrom including, in the UK, the Value
Added Tax of 1984 and legislation supplemental thereto and any other tax
(wherever and whenever imposed and whether imposed in substitution thereof or
in addition thereto) of a similar fiscal nature; and   (ii) the "Sixth
Directive" means EC Council Directive 77/388 (Sixth Council Directive of 17
May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to
turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of
assessment).   55    12.7 Non-Waiver. The failure in any one or more
instances of a party  ---------- to insist upon performance of any of the
terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, to exercise any right or
privilege in this Agreement conferred, or the waiver by said party of any
breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, shall
not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants,
conditions, rights or privileges, but this Agreement shall continue and
remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had
occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of the waiving party.   12.8 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in multiple  ------------ counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall
constitute but one instrument.   12.9 Severability. The invalidity of any
provision of this Agreement  ------------ or portion of a provision shall
not affect the validity of any other provision of this Agreement or the
remaining portion of the applicable provision.   12.10 Applicable Law. This
Agreement shall be governed and controlled  -------------- as to validity,
enforcement, interpretation, construction, effect and in all other respects
by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made in
that State.   12.11 Binding Effect; Benefit. This Agreement shall inure to
the  -------------- benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, and
their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall confer on any person other than the parties hereto, and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations
or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, including, third party
beneficiary rights.   12.12 Assignability. This Agreement shall not be
assignable by any  ------------- party without the prior written consent of
the other parties; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign any or all of
its respective rights and interests under this Agreement to one or more of
its Affiliates and designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (in any or all of which cases the original
party nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations under this Agreement).   12.13 Amendments. This Agreement shall
not be modified or amended  ---------- except pursuant to an instrument in
writing executed and delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto.  
12.14 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for 
-------- convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.   12.15 Governmental Reporting. Anything
to the contrary in this  ---------------------- Agreement notwithstanding,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to mean that a party hereto or
other person must make or file, or cooperate in the making or filing of, any
return or report to any governmental authority in any manner that such person
or such party reasonably believes or reasonably is advised is not in
accordance with law.   12.16 Rule of Construction. The parties acknowledge
and agree that each  -------------------- has negotiated and reviewed the
terms of this Agreement, been assisted by such legal and tax counsel as they
desired, and has contributed to its revisions. The parties further agree that
the rule of construction that any ambiguities are resolved against the
drafting party will be subordinated to the principle that the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will be construed fairly as to all parties and
not in favor of or against any party. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The word "including," means
"including, without limitation." Unless the context clearly requires
otherwise, "law" shall refer to any applicable U.S. or non-U.S. federal,
state or local law.   56    12.17 Consent to Jurisdiction. Seller and
Purchaser each agrees to the  ----------------------- exclusive jurisdiction
of any state or federal court within Delaware, with respect to any claim or
cause of action arising under or relating to this Agreement, and waives
personal service of any and all process upon it, and consents that all
services of process be made by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, directed to it at its address as set forth in Section 12.4, and
service so made shall be deemed to be completed when received. Seller and
Purchaser each waives any objection based on forum non conveniens and
waives any objection to venue of any action instituted hereunder. Nothing in
this paragraph shall affect the right of Seller or Purchaser to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law.   12.18 No Effect.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the  --------- Ancillary
Agreements, all existing contracts between Seller or any of its Affiliates on
the one hand and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on the other hand will
remain in full force and effect.   12.19 Definitions. The following terms
