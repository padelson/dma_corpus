ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

Section 2.1 _Surrender and Exchange_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, with the approval
of the Company which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company, or a subsidiary thereof, to act
as paying and exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of the shares of Holdings Common Stock issued pursuant
to _Section 1.7_, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 1.8_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Holdings Common Stock and
(ii) any cash to be paid  



 

14  pursuant to _Section 1.8(e) _in respect of any cash in lieu of fractional
shares in exchange for outstanding Membership Interests upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of instructions for use in effecting the transfer and
cancellation of Membership Interests in exchange for the applicable NYSE/AMEX
Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ and this
_Article II_  (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of this Section 2.1,
unless the context requires otherwise, the term "Membership Interests"
shall refer to former Membership Interests which, prior to the Effective
Time, shall have been converted into the right to receive the Regular Holdings
Membership Consideration or the Options Principal Membership Consideration in
accordance with the terms of Section 1.7.

(b) _The Letter of Transmittal_. Parent and the Company shall cause
appropriate transmittal materials, in such form as reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), to be provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of record of
the Membership Interests as soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Mergers and the procedure
for providing instructions to the Exchange Agent to effect the transfer and
cancellation of Membership Interests in exchange for the NYSE/AMEX Merger
Consideration. Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall
have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement, governing the validity of the Letter of Transmittal. 

(c) After the Effective Time, upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of
instructions authorizing transfer and cancellation of each Membership
Interest in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal, the
holders of such Membership Interests shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock in respect
of the aggregate NYSE/AMEX Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to _Article I_ (after taking into account all Membership
Interests then held by such holder), and (ii) a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and Membership Interests which are the subject of such
authorization shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon such transfer and cancellation of any
Membership Interests. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any
Membership Interest that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a
check for any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, may be issued
and/or paid to such a transferee if written instructions authorizing the
transfer of any Membership Interests are presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If
any shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that
in which the Membership Interest is registered on the books of the Company,
it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of such Membership Interest as reflected on the books of the
Company, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.



 

15 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_.

(1) All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the NYSE/AMEX
Merger (excluding shares to be issued pursuant to  _Section 6.17_) shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all such shares.
No dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to any holder of any Membership Interest until the instructions for
transfer and cancellation provided in this _Article II_ have been delivered to
the Exchange Agent. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
delivery to the Exchange Agent of such instructions, there shall be issued
and/or paid to the Membership Interest holder whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such
delivery of such instructions, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

(2) Holders of Membership Interests in respect of which such instructions for
transfer and cancellation have not been delivered shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Membership Interests
(excluding shares to be issued pursuant to _Section 6.17_), regardless of
whether such holders have delivered such instructions to the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Membership Interests held by them. 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Common
Stock) that remains unclaimed by the former members of the Company or the
former stockholders of Holdings for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent. Any former members of the Company, former stockholders
of Holdings who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common
Stock of such stockholders and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends and other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock
of such stockholders payable and/or issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)
_upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal of any Membership Interest, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, AMEX or
any surviving entity in the Mergers, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Membership Interests for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

Section 2.2 _Transfers_. At or after effective time of the Holdings Merger,
there shall be no transfers on the membership transfer books of the Company of
the Membership Interests that were outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the Holdings Merger.



 

16 Section 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with,
the NYSE/AMEX Merger.

Section 2.5 _Restrictions on Equity Issuances_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary on and after the date hereof and until the Effective Time, the
Company shall not (1) issue, grant, convey or provide to any Person any right
of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive a Membership
Interest or benefits measured by the value of Membership Interests or (2)
issue or agree to issue any Membership Interests or take any other action that
could cause the aggregate number of Membership Interests to change.

land, building and improvements of which the Company or a Company Subsidiary

determination letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust
that has not been revoked, and the Company knows of no existing circumstances
and no events have occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the related trust. All
material contributions required to be made to any Plan, and all material
premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Plan,
for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or, to the extent
not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been

With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, except as would not, individually

Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied, and are
now in compliance with all Laws and regulations applicable to such Employee
Benefit Plans and (ii) each Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms.

Affiliates has, at any time during the last six  



 

27  years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor
any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been
satisfied in full. To the knowledge of the Company, there does not now exist,
nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that would be a material liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no
liability for welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to
the Company and its Subsidiaries or for continuation of welfare benefits
pursuant to an employment or severance arrangement for a period following
termination of employment of no greater than three years. The Company has
taken such actions as it deems necessary to reserve the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time all arrangements providing for retiree welfare
coverage. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) None of the
Company and its Subsidiaries nor any other person, including any fiduciary,
has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Employee
Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA and (ii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and,
to Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Employee Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans.

(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in
the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, all Employee Benefit
Plans subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States

if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,

a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") that
is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has been operated in all material
respects based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of
the Code and the authorities thereunder.

(h) With respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not exist any
accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of such Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all
accrued benefits under such Plan (whether or not vested) on a termination
basis; (iii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of
ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; (iv)
all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have been timely paid
in full; (v) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under
Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or

that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would
constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan.

other Party and/or its counsel to review in advance any communication intended
to be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting
or conference with, any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization.
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other Party
under this clause (a) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company as
the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this clause (a), materials provided to the other Party or its
outside counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation

conducting its business or that of the Company after the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to clause (a), each of Parent and the Company shall use its

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection therewith and
subject to clause (a), if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
inconsistent with or violative of any Law, each of Parent and the Company
shall cooperate with the other Party with respect to such objection and use
its reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist (by negotiation,
litigation or otherwise) any action or proceeding related thereto, including
any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any Order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in clauses (a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by  



 

50  any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and
the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or
cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including
taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, as any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization may assert
under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of
this Agreement, in no event will Parent or its Subsidiaries be obligated to
(i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise take any actions or commit to take any actions that,
in each case, would be reasonably likely to result in a Detriment individually
or in the aggregate, or (ii) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other
than the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries as provided for in this
_Section 6.4(c)_), or otherwise take or commit to take any actions that after
the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in each case,
excluding any such sale, divestiture, disposition or action that to the
Knowledge of Parent has been requested of Parent or proposed to Parent by any
Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization prior to the date hereof.

(d) With regard to any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
Representatives, shall, without Parents prior written consent in Parents
sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, extension
of any waiting period under any Law or any agreement not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or discuss or commit to alter
their businesses or commercial practices, or the businesses or commercial
practices of Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries as provided for in Section 6.4(c)), in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents ability to
retain, or Parents freedom of action with respect to, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise receive the economic benefits
to Parent reasonably expected by Parent to be realized from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, excluding any such commitments
or actions that to Parents knowledge has been requested from Parent or
proposed to Parent by any Governmental Entity or Self Regulatory Organization
prior to the date hereof.

(e) The Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company shall each consider and
make such determination with respect to the other Party, its Related Persons
(as defined in the certificate of incorporation of Parent) and the Persons of
which Parent and the Company are Related Persons, as required by any
Governmental Entity and any Self-Regulatory Organization whose consent is
required for the consummation of the Mergers. The Company, Parent and their  



 

51  respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to provide such information to the SEC, the European Regulators and
any other Governmental Entity as is required with respect to the
consideration by the SEC, the European Regulators and any other Governmental
Entity as may be required to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, none of
the Company, AMCAS, Holdings, AMEX or AMEX Merger Sub shall, nor shall they
authorize or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, and they shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives and
their Subsidiaries respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
(i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or induce any inquiries or the making, submission
or announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover Proposal for the Company or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) have any discussions with or provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating or with respect to a
Takeover Proposal for the Company or any of its Affiliates, or engage in any

Affiliates, or otherwise cooperate with or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Takeover Proposal for
the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal for the Company or any

Affiliates.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to the receipt of
the Company Member Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover
Proposal for the Company or any of its Affiliates (so long as such Takeover
Proposal was not initiated, solicited or facilitated, directly or
indirectly, by a breach of this _Section 6.5 _and the Party in receipt of
such Takeover Proposal has otherwise complied with the terms of this _Section
6.5 _with respect to such Takeover Proposal), and subject to compliance
with Section 6.5(d):

(i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to
and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Company (and/or AMEX as applicable) than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that would prevent
the Company, as applicable, from complying with its obligation to provide the
required disclosure to Parent pursuant to  _Section 6.5(b)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that all such information provided to such Person has previously
been  



 

52  provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially

Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of the Company

such information or participating in such discussions or negotiations would be
reasonably necessary to perform its fiduciary duties and (ii) such Takeover
Proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing

information previously furnished to such Persons that has not been previously
returned in connection therewith and (B) promptly inform its Representatives
of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.5_. Without limiting the
foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.5_

Takeover Proposal, and in any case within one (1) Business Day after the
receipt thereof, the Company shall provide oral and written notice to Parent
of (i) such Takeover Proposal, (ii) the identity of the Person making any
such Takeover Proposal and (iii) a summary of all material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any amendments or material
modifications thereto). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a timely
basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal (and, in any event, upon the
request of Parent), including any amendments or material modifications to the
terms and conditions thereof, and promptly, and in any case within one (1)
Business Day after the receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of a
summary of the material terms of all Takeover Proposals (and amendments or
material modifications thereof) and related agreements, draft agreements
exchanged by the Parties and modifications thereof.

(d)(I) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof

time prior the Company Member Approval, the Company Board of Directors may,
in response to a Superior Proposal for the Company, effect a Change in Company
Recommendation and recommend such Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company Board of Directors may not effect such a Change in
Company Recommendation unless (i) the Company Board of Directors shall have
first provided prior written notice Parent that it is prepared to effect such
a Change in Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement relating
to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and (ii) Parent
does not make, prior to midnight, New York time, on the fifth (5th) Business

later), a proposal that the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, is at least as favorable, in the aggregate (taking into
account all of the factors and other aspects of such proposal included in the
definition of Superior Proposal), to its Members as such Superior Proposal ("
_Matching Bid_ "). The Company agrees that, during the five-(5)-Business-Day
period (as extended, in accordance with the terms set forth above, in the case
of a Takeover Proposal that has been materially revised or modified) prior to
its effecting a Change in Company Recommendation it and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

(III) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.5(d)(I)_, in circumstances
other than as provided in _Section 6.5(d)(II)_, at any time prior to the
Company Member Approval, the Company Board of Directors may effect a Change
in Company Recommendation if it determines in good faith in accordance with
the advice of outside counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary for
such Board of Directors to perform its fiduciary duties, but only after (A)
providing written notice to Parent that it is prepared to make the
determination permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)(III)_ and setting forth the
reasons therefore and (B) for a period of seven (7) Business Days after
providing such notice, the Company Board of Directors or committee that is
proposing to effect such Change in Company Recommendation negotiates with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable the Company Board of Directors to proceed with
its recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and at midnight, New York time, on the seventh (7th) Business Day following
the date of receipt of such notice at the end of such period, the applicable
Board of Directors or committee maintains its determination permitted by this
_Section 6.5(d)(III) _(after taking into account the proposed adjustments).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made
by a Third Party obtained not in breach of this _Section 6.5 _for or in
respect of a Business Combination Transaction involving, or any transaction
involving the purchase or acquisition of, (i) 100% of the voting power of the
equity Securities of the Company or (ii) 100% of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, which transaction the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the Takeover Proposal and this Agreement (including the
expected timing of the proposed Business Combination Transaction as opposed to
the NYSE/AMEX Merger), and taking into account any improved terms proposed by
Parent, (x) would be, if consummated, more favorable from a financial point of
view to its Members than the Mergers; (y) is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all relevant
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, including any
conditions, and the identity of the Third Party and (z) for  



 

54  which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or which,
in the good-faith judgment of a Board of Directors (based on the advice
of independent financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being timely
financed by such Third Party.

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer for, or any indication of
interest in, (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or
similar transaction involving the Company or AMEX, as applicable, or any of
the Companys Affiliates which represent, individually or in the aggregate,
20% or more of its consolidated assets with any Person other than Parent or
its Affiliates (a " _Third Party_ "), in which such Third Party or the
stockholders of the Third Party immediately prior to consummation of such
Business Combination Transaction will own, directly or indirectly, more than
20% of the outstanding equity Securities of the Company or AMEX, as
applicable, immediately following such Business Combination Transaction,
including the issuance by the Company or AMEX of more than 20% of any class of
the voting equity Securities of the Company or AMEX, as applicable,
as consideration for assets or securities of a Third Party or (ii) any direct
or indirect acquisition, whether by tender or exchange offer or otherwise, by
any Third Party of 20% or more of any class of outstanding equity Securities

Company or AMEX in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
(any of the foregoing, a " _Business Combination Transaction_ ").

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall honor all Employee Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms to the extent previously provided to Parent as in effect on the date
hereof or as amended subsequently hereto in accordance with Section 5.1,
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any such plan in accordance with its terms. After the Effective Time
and until December 31, 2008, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided, to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") base
salary and annual cash bonus opportunities and welfare benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Company Employees
immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ , that for this purpose, the
welfare benefits provided under Parent Benefit Plans shall be considered no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, further, that Parent shall,
to the extent Company Employees become eligible to participate in Parent
Benefit Plans providing welfare benefits, (i) cause there to be waived any
pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements with respect to Company Employees and their eligible
dependents to the extent such condition or limitations did not apply to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) give effect,
for the year in which the Company Employee becomes eligible to participate in
such Parent Benefit Plan, for purposes of satisfying any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and
amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees and their eligible dependents under
similar plans maintained by the Company in which such Company Employees and
their eligible dependents participated immediately prior to such eligibility.



 

55 (b) Parent shall honor until the first anniversary of the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms the Companys Severance Pay Plan to the extent
previously provided to Parent as in effect on the date hereof or as amended
subsequently hereto in accordance with _Section 5.1_. Parent shall honor in
accordance with their terms the American Stock Exchange LLC Employees
Retirement Plan, the American Stock Exchange LLC Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and the Companys retiree welfare program to the extent
previously provided to Parent as in effect on the date hereof or as amended

notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any such plan in accordance with its terms.

(c) Parent shall provide that any Company Employees who become participants
in Parent Benefit Plans will be given credit under such plans and programs,
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder, for all
service recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as if
such service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company, except (i) for
purposes of any retiree welfare plan, (ii) as such service credit would result
in a duplication of benefits, (iii) to the extent that any new plan is
established by Parent that does not recognize service of similarly-situated
employees of NYSE and its Subsidiaries and (iv) benefit accrual will not be
provided under defined benefit pension benefit plans.

(d) This Section 6.6 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns,
executors and legal representatives. Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.5(b), nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied: (i) is
intended to confer on any person other than the Parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; (ii) shall require the
Parent to maintain any specific Plan or to guarantee employment of any
employee for any period of time after the Effective Time; and (iii) shall
constitute an amendment to any Plan.

the Company Member Approval and all other matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. From
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and Parent (the "
_Indemnifying Persons_ ") shall  



 

56  (i) indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in all of their
capacities) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys Constituent Documents
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with
any Indemnified Persons, (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers and directors and
advancement of expenses contained in the Companys Constituent Documents
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) maintain for a period of six
years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D and O
Insurance_") maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Persons (or any successors) may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying Persons be
required to expend in any one year more than 200% of the current annual
premium expended by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain or
procure such D and O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
200% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Indemnifying Persons shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at Parents option, in lieu of
maintaining the insurance described in clause (iii) of this  _Section 6.8_,
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the insured than the current directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company; _provided_ that the amount paid by the Company shall not exceed 200%
of the aggregate amount per annum that the Company and its Subsidiaries paid
for such coverage in the last full fiscal year. The obligations of
the Indemnifying Persons under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to
whom this _Section 6.8_ applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to
whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.8_). The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section
6.8_ shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may
have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Indemnifying
Persons or any of their Subsidiaries, under the DGCL, or otherwise. The
provisions of this  _Section 6.8_ shall survive the consummation of the
NYSE/AMEX Merger. In the event that any Indemnifying Persons or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, such
Indemnifying Persons shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Persons, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

Agreement and the Mergers shall be a joint press release. Thereafter, Parent

Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any

occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date and (ii) any
failure of Parent, the Company, AMCAS, Holdings, AMEX or AMEX Merger Sub, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.10_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
Party receiving such notice.

hereby, Parent, the Company and their respective Board of Directors shall use

necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise
act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

correspondence received from the IRS in relation to the ruling request(s)) or
any discussions with the IRS, and (ii) provide the other Parties
counsel with the opportunity to review and comment on all substantive
submissions to the IRS relating to such ruling request and, to the extent
practicable, attend all substantive meetings and participate in all
substantive discussions with the IRS relating to such submissions). To the
extent the IRS will accept a private letter ruling request filed on that
basis, the Parties intend to submit a joint request to the IRS with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.15 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Holdings
shall deliver to Parent (a) a certification from Holdings that complies with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), dated no more than thirty (30)

to Section 2.3 hereof, to withhold from the portion of the NYSE/AMEX Merger
Consideration otherwise issuable to a holder of Holdings Common Stock (and
from any shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise required to be issued to a
holder of Holdings Common Stock pursuant to _Section 6.17_) any amounts
required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code, unless such
holder provides Parent with a duly executed certificate of non-foreign
status, substantially in the form of the applicable sample certification
contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv). The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be withheld shall be based on the Pre-Merger

Price).

Auditor Report_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver
to Parent no later than March 31, 2008, and in any event shall deliver

Properties_. 

(a) _Contingent Consideration_

(1) If the Sale Date shall occur prior to the Contingent Payment End Date,
then no later than 45 Business Days following the Sale Date, or such longer
period as shall be reasonably necessary to determine and provide an accounting
for the Building Sale Net Proceeds, or at such time as otherwise mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Former Member Representative (but, in no event
on or after the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date or, unless Parent
otherwise agrees, prior to the 20th Business Day following the Closing Date),
Parent shall deliver to each former holder of Holdings Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Former Members_ "), as
additional consideration in the NYSE/AMEX Merger, a number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Building Sale
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share (the " _Contingent
Consideration_ "), _provided_ , that if the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise required to be issued pursuant to this _Section
6.17 _exceeds the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a) _(such amount, as appropriately adjusted for any
stock splits, combinations, reclassifications or other similar actions
occurring after the Closing Date, the " _Contingent Consideration Cap_ "),
the aggregate number of shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section 6.17
_shall be equal to the Contingent Consideration Cap and the Contingent
Consideration shall be reduced proportionately.

(2) Parents obligation to issue the Contingent Consideration shall be
conditioned on no court or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or imposes any penalty (other than
penalties which are absolute dollar amounts, which shall be included in
Building Sale Costs and which shall not, together with all other Building Sale
Costs, exceed the Gross Amount) upon the payment of the
Contingent Consideration. If the Contingent Consideration shall not have been
issued by the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall have any further obligation to issue the Contingent
Consideration.

Members for purposes of this _Section 6.17 _(the " _Former Member
Representative_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Former Member
Representative shall act free of direction or instruction from Former  



 

60  Members, Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to the proviso in the
preceding sentence and compliance with appropriate procedures to avoid
the dissemination of material non-public information regarding Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Former Member Representative may communicate with
Former Members. From the Closing Date until the earlier of the Sale Date or
the Contingent Payment End Date, Parent shall advance all reasonable Former
Member Representative Expenses. Parent shall be entitled to rely upon any
action taken by the Former Member Representative with respect to any matter
set forth in this _Section 6.17_. None of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall indemnify such Former Member
Representative.

(2) The Company, the Former Member Representative and Parent (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries) shall exclusively have the right to enforce this
_Section 6.17_; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that
(with the exception of expenses incurred in bringing actions or claims which
result in a final judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction that Parent
knowingly and willfully breached the provisions of this _Section 6.17_ (
_provided_ ,  _that_ , prior to any claim or action being brought, Parent
shall have been given written notice of and not have cured such breach within
thirty (30) Business Days following such written notice)), any expenses they
incur in doing so shall be included in the Former Member Representative
Expenses. Following the Effective Time, this _Section 6.17 _may be amended,
and may only be amended, in writing as mutually agreed upon by Parent and the
Former Member Representative;  _provided_ , further that the Former Member
Representative shall only be entitled to seek specific performance and shall
not be entitled to seek monetary damages.

(3)(i) No later than 10 Business Days following the Sale Date, the Former
Member Representative shall present Parent with a good faith written
calculation, in reasonable detail, certified by one or more officers of the
Former Member Representative (or if the Former Member Representative shall be
a natural person, by the Former Member Representative), of total Former
Member Representative Expenses; and (ii) from time to time upon Parents
request, the Former Member Representative shall present Parent with a good
faith written calculation, in reasonable detail, certified by one or more
officers of the Former Member Representative (or if the Former Member
Representative shall be a natural person, by the Former Member
Representative), of Former Member Representative Expenses incurred to date. If
requested by the Parent, the Former Member Representative shall promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Parent and its Representatives such
work papers, receipts and other documents and information relating to the
calculation of the Former Member Representative Expenses.

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, the Former Member Representative shall not
have the authority to and shall not enter into any Sale Arrangements.

(c) Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in connection with the sale
process, including without limitation, in obtaining one or more owners ALTA
policy of title insurance (including all endorsements) and an ALTA survey(s)
with respect to the Company Owned Real Properties, executing, acknowledging
and delivering all customary owners/title affidavits (or other  



 

61  customary documents as reasonably requested by such purchasers title
insurer), executing and delivering all brokerage contracts and/or
agreements, participating in any meetings or negotiations with any and all
industrial development, economic development and/or Governmental Entities (the
" _Economic Development Entities_ ") relating to any arrangements concerning
the Company Owned Real Properties (the " _Economic Development Agreements_ ")
and executing contracts of sale and other customary documents as reasonably
requested or required to consummate such sale transaction. Promptly following
the execution of this Agreement and continuing for so long as shall be
reasonably necessary, Parent and the Company shall together (and neither party
shall do so separately) meet with the Economic Development Entities for the
purposes of renegotiating the Economic Development Agreements.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, with regard
to the Company Owned Real Properties, (i) no preliminary or pre-sale, sale or
other preparations, activities or communications whatsoever (including
without limitation discussions with brokers or any other consultants,
prospective buyers, or pre-marketing or marketing) shall be initiated,
solicited, undertaken or participated in by any of the Parties or their
Representatives with respect to any such pre-sale, sale or sale process and
(ii) no provision of this Agreement shall be, nor shall be deemed to
constitute, an intention or proposal to sell or prepare for sale or to
initiate the sale process with respect to any of the Company Owned Real
Properties, in any event until and unless the Parties have met with
representatives of the Economic Development Entities with respect to the
Economic Development Agreements. Following the Effective Time, Parent or
its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, except as
otherwise agreed between Parent and the Former Member Representative, (1)
defend against any proceeding or litigation brought by a third party seeking
to delay or prevent the sale of the Company Owned Real Properties or (2)
bring such claims or actions that Parent in its reasonable judgment believes
to be meritorious and advantageous against any potential buyer of the Company
Owned Real Properties that has materially breached a Sale Arrangement to
compel such buyer to perform its duties under such Sale Arrangement;
_provided_ , that (i) any costs fees and expenses (including all attorneys
fees and experts and consultants fees) incurred in doing so shall be
included in Building Sale Costs and, together with all other Building Sale
Costs, shall be less than the Gross Amount in Parents reasonable estimation,
and (ii) Parent shall not be required to take any action which, if taken,
would be reasonably likely to have a materially negative effect on Parents
business or reputation. Any intended or proposed sale of the Company Owned
Real Properties shall be subject to _Section 6.17(i) _and, subject to
_Section 6.17(f)_, may include a provision permitting Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to lease the Company Owned Real
Properties following the Sale Date.

(d) Subject to _Section 6.17(c)_, _Section 6.17(i)_ and _Section 6.17(l)_,
from the Closing Date until the earlier of the Sale Date or the three-year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Company Sale Period_ "):

(1) The Former Member Representative shall be responsible for conducting the
sale process with respect to the Company Owned Real Properties, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without Parents prior written consent, no letter
of intent, memorandum, term sheet, contract, agreement, or other arrangement
providing for the negotiation, option to purchase or sale of any Company Owned
Real Properties (collectively, " _Sale Arrangements_ ") shall be entered
into unless and until (1) the cash price being paid in connection with such
sale is in Parents reasonable estimation greater  



 

62  than the Building Sale Costs and (2) Parent has consented to the other terms
and conditions of such sale, including without limitation the identity
and creditworthiness of the buyer, the buyers source of funds and/or
financing, due diligence period and timing of the closing of such sale, which
consent (except as provided in _Section 6.17(f)_) shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed;

(2) Parent shall be provided with, upon its request, such information and
materials regarding the marketing and/or sale of the Company Owned Real
Properties as Parent may reasonably request, including without limitation
buyers financial statements and copies of all proposed Sale Arrangements
(which information and materials shall be kept strictly confidential by
Parent); and

(3) The Former Member Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts
to negotiate the sale of the Company Owned Real Properties as promptly as
practicable at the highest cash price reasonably available and on otherwise
customary terms, including using a reputable real estate broker with knowledge
of the downtown Manhattan real estate market.

(e) If no definitive contract providing for the Sale of all Company Owned Real
Properties shall have been entered into and be in effect prior to the
termination of the Company Sale Period, the Former Member Representative and
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent shall submit the Company Owned Real
Properties to a sale by auction for a period of up to 120 days from the
termination of the Company Sale Period (the " _Auction Period_ ") ( _provided_
, that the closing date of any contract providing for the sale of the Company
Owned Real Properties entered into pursuant to such auction may be outside of
such 120 day period), shall mutually select a third party auctioneer with
experience in auctioning commercial real properties and shall direct such
auctioneer to, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this 
_Section 6.17_, sell the Company Owned Real Properties at the highest cash
price reasonably available; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) unless otherwise
consented to by Parent in writing, the bidding in such auction shall start
at, and no bid will be accepted which shall be less than, Parents reasonable
estimation of the Building Sale Costs and (2) the terms and conditions of such
sale by auction, including without limitation the identity
and creditworthiness of the buyer, the buyers source of funds and/or
financing, due diligence period and timing of the closing of such sale, shall
be subject to Parents consent, which consent (except as provided in 
_Section 6.17(f)_) shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover Proposal
for the Company or any of its Affiliates or (2) _Section 8.1(h)_ (Change in
Company Recommendation), then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, $10 million (the " _Termination Fee_
") on the second Business Day following such termination ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Termination Fee shall be net of any amounts previously
paid under _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_).

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)
_(General Breach by the Company), (2) pursuant to _Section 8.1(d) _(No
Company Member Approval), or (3) pursuant to _Section 8.1(b) _(Outside Date)
without a vote of the Members of the Company contemplated by this Agreement
at the Company Members Meeting having occurred, and (B) a Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly  



 

73  announced or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company
(or any person shall have publicly announced or communicated a _bona fide _
intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Takeover Proposal) at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of the taking of
the votes of the members of the Company contemplated by this Agreement at the
Company Members Meeting in the case of clause (2), or the date of
termination, in the case of clauses (1) or (3), then the Company shall pay to
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
one-half of the Termination Fee on the (2nd) second Business Day following
such termination (in the case of a termination by Parent) and prior to such
termination (in the case of a termination by the Company); _provided_ that,
if within 18 months after the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an additional amount equal to
one-half of the Termination Fee concurrently with or prior to the execution of
such agreement or consummation of such transactions, as the case may be (
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Termination Fee shall be net of any amounts
previously paid under _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_).

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(e) _(General Breach by the Company),  _Section 8.1(f)_ (Breach of Non-
Solicitation by the Company) or _Section 8.1(h)_ (Change in Company
Recommendation) then the Company shall reimburse Parent, if this Agreement is
terminated by the Company, at or prior to such termination, and if this
Agreement is terminated by Parent, promptly upon demand, but in no event later
than two Business Days after the date of such demand, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for all Reimbursable Expenses of Parent. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Reimbursable Expenses_ " of a Party shall
be the cash amount necessary to fully reimburse such Party, its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred (whether
or not billed) at any time (whether before or after the date of this
Agreement) prior to the termination of this Agreement by any of them or on
their behalf in connection with the Mergers, the preparation of this
Agreement, their due diligence investigation of the other Parties and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any currency or
interest rate hedging activities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), including all fees and expenses of counsel, investment
banking firms or financial advisors (and their respective counsel and
Representatives), accountants, experts and consultants to such Party or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the Mergers, the
preparation of this Agreement, their due diligence investigation of the other
Parties and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the sum of any amounts paid by
the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, _Section 8.3(a)(ii)
_and _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the
Termination Fee.

(b) _Expense Reimbursement Payable by Parent._ In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(g) _(General Breach by
Parent), then Parent shall reimburse the Company, if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent, at or prior to such termination, and if this Agreement
is terminated by the Company, promptly upon demand, but in  



 

74  no event later than two Business Days after the date of such termination, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, for all Reimbursable Expenses
of the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of the
Reimbursable Expenses that Parent is obligated to reimburse the Company
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_ exceed an amount equal to the Termination
Fee.

 

(c) The Parties each agree that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party fails promptly to pay any amounts due under
this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against such Party for such amounts, such Party shall pay interest on such
amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of
actual payment at the prime rate of Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the
date such payment was due, together with the costs and expenses of the other
Party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Construction_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or
Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall
include the disclosure letters delivered pursuant hereto. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
 



 

76  other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received
counterparts thereof signed and delivered by the other Party hereto. Copies of
executed counterparts transmitted by telecopy, telefax or electronic
transmission shall be considered original executed counterparts for purposes
of this _Section 9.4 provided_ that receipt of copies of such counterparts is
confirmed.

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure
letters hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a Party to this Agreement any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than _Section
6.8_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such Persons).

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.



 

77 Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Member Approval; _provided_ that
following the receipt of the Company Member Approval, no amendment shall be
made which any applicable Law or regulation requires further approval by such
Members without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 9.10 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS. The Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware in respect of all matters arising out of or
relating to this Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of
the provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding
for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.2_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR  



 

78  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.10(b)_.

Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
