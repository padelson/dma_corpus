have approved the Survey, the Condominium Plats, the Title Commitment and all
of the documents and instruments referenced therein. Upon receipt by Seller of
a Title Disapproval Notice given in a timely manner, Seller may elect to
notify Buyer (being a "Seller Response Notice") as to each properly
disapproved matter either that: (i) Seller elects not to cause such
disapproved matter to be removed as of the Closing Date (or otherwise take any
action with respect thereto), or (ii) Seller intends to either: (a) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such disapproved matter to be removed
or released on the Closing Date; or (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Title Company to insure over such disapproved matter; provided,
however, Seller shall not be in default hereunder, and shall have no
liability, if for any reason, after electing either choice under (ii) above,
such additional disapproved matters are not removed, released, or insured over
as aforesaid as of the Closing Date; provided, however, in such case Buyer
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement whereupon the Deposit (less
the Independent Consideration) shall be promptly delivered by the Escrow Agent
to Buyer, and the parties shall have no further obligations or liabilities
hereunder (except for any obligations or liabilities that expressly survive
termination of this Agreement). If Seller has provided a Seller Response
Notice to Buyer by the date which is three (3) days prior to the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period stating that Seller will not remove, release or
otherwise correct such disapproved exceptions or if Seller has not provided a
Seller Response Notice to Buyer prior to the date which is three (3) days
prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (which shall be deemed an
election by Seller not to take any action with respect to such items), then
Buyer may elect in writing not later than the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period, either to waive Buyer's objection to such disapproved exceptions or to
terminate this Agreement. If Buyer shall fail to make such election, then
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its objections to such disapproved
exceptions. In the event Buyer shall elect in writing to terminate this
Agreement, the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration) shall be promptly
delivered by the Escrow Agent to Buyer, and the parties shall have no further
obligations or liabilities hereunder (except for any obligations or
liabilities that expressly survive termination of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing



3721766.8

-9-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



provisions of this Section 4.2, Seller shall take such actions as may be
reasonably required by Title Company so that Title Company is willing to issue
title insurance to Buyer without exception for the following: (i) any liens
securing any mortgage, deed of trust or other financing, or (ii) any
mechanics' liens or materialmens' liens ("Other Liens") arising from any work
or improvements at the Property that encumber the Property on the Closing Date
(other than liens or claims arising from Buyer's due diligence reviews or
inspections hereunder) ((i) and (ii) are collectively referred to as "Monetary
Liens"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved
any Other Liens, provided Seller procures (at Seller's sole cost and expense)
prior to the Closing a written commitment from the Title Company to issue the
Owner's Policy, or an endorsement thereto, insuring Buyer against any such
Other Liens; provided, however, Seller shall not be obligated to pay or expend
more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) to cure, insure over or
release Other Liens.

4.3 It is understood that Buyer may request a number of endorsements to or
extended coverage for the Owner's Policy. Buyer shall satisfy itself prior to
the expiration of the Due Diligence Period that the Title Company will be
willing to issue such endorsements or extended coverage in connection with the
Owner's Policy, and, accordingly, in no event shall the issuance of such
endorsements or extended coverage to the Owner's Policy constitute a condition
to Buyer's obligations under this Agreement.

4.4 As used herein: "Permitted Exceptions" means the following: (1) the lien
of any real estate taxes and assessments for the year 2017, and subsequent
periods, a lien not yet due and payable provided that the same are prorated in
accordance with this Agreement; (2) such other matters set forth in the Title
Commitment which are approved or deemed approved, pursuant to the terms
hereof, by Buyer during the Due Diligence Period (in any event to include the
exceptions listed in Exhibit "D") and any matter shown on the Condominium
Plat; (3) any New Matter (as hereinafter defined) which has been approved, or
deemed approved by Buyer, pursuant to Section 4.5 below; (4) the printed
exceptions which appear in the standard 2006 ALTA form of owner's title
insurance policy; and (5) all building, signage and zoning ordinances, laws,
regulations and restrictions by or of municipal and other governmental
authorities. After Closing, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer, and Buyer
and its successors and assigns shall make no claim against Seller, for the
Permitted Exceptions, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4. This
provision shall survive the Closing.

4.5 If an additional exception to title ("New Matter") affecting the Property
is first disclosed to Buyer after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period,
Buyer shall be deemed to have approved any such New Matter within five (5)
days of Buyer's discovery of such New Matter unless Buyer delivers to Seller
within such time written notice of its objection thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any New Matter that is the result of the activities of Buyer, or
that does not adversely impact the marketability of title to the Property,
shall be deemed approved by Buyer, and Buyer shall have no right to object to
such New Matter. Seller may elect to use reasonable efforts to remove or cause
the Title Company to bond, insure or endorse over such New Matter within
thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of notice from Buyer with respect to
the New Matter (and the Closing Date shall be extended to accommodate such
cure period). In the event that within such thirty (30) day period Seller (1)
does not elect to remove or cause the Title Company to bond, insure or endorse
over such New Matter, or (2) elects but fails to remove or cause the Title
Company to bond, insure or endorse over such New Matter, then upon the
expiration of such period, Buyer, as its sole and exclusive remedy hereunder
for such failure, shall elect in writing either (a) to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which case the Deposit (less the
Independent Consideration) shall be returned to Buyer, this Agreement shall be
null and void and of no further



3721766.8

-10-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



force or effect and the parties hereto shall have no further obligations to
the other (except for any obligations or liabilities that expressly survive
termination of this Agreement), or (b) to waive the foregoing right of
termination and all other rights and remedies on account of such New Matter
and to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, without any
reduction or abatement of the Purchase Price. If Buyer shall fail to make such
election, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its objections to such
disapproved New Matter.

4.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall convey the Units to Buyer
through the form of special warranty deed (or its equivalent) attached hereto
as Exhibit "C" (the "Deed"), which will convey the portion of the Property
described therein to Buyer subject to the Permitted Exceptions.

5\. Conditions Precedent. The obligation of Buyer to purchase, and Seller to
sell, the Property as contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
satisfaction of each of the following respective conditions precedent (any of
which may be waived in writing by the party in whose favor such condition
exists) on or before the applicable date specified for satisfaction of the
applicable condition. If any of such conditions is not fulfilled (or so
waived) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the party in whose favor such condition exists may
elect not to proceed with this Agreement and, in connection with any such
election made in accordance with this Section 5, Seller and Buyer shall be
released from further obligation or liability hereunder (except for those
obligations and liabilities which, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
survive such termination [and without releasing any party for a breach or
default occurring prior to such termination]), and the Deposit shall be
disposed of in accordance with Section 10.

5.1 Intentionally Deleted.

5.2 No Bankruptcy or Dissolution. A condition precedent to Seller's obligation
to sell the Property shall be that that at no time on or before the Closing
Date shall any "Bankruptcy/Dissolution Event" (as hereinafter defined) have
occurred with respect to Buyer, and if Buyer is a partnership or limited
liability company, any general partners or managing members, as the case may
be, of Buyer. A condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to purchase the
Property shall be that that at no time on or before the Closing Date shall any
Bankruptcy/Dissolution Event have occurred with respect to Seller or its
managing member.

5.3 Performance by Seller. The performance and observance, in all material
respects, by Seller of all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date under this
Agreement shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to purchase the
Property. In addition, a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to purchase
the Property shall be that the representations and warranties of Seller are
true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as if made on
such Closing Date; with materiality being determined in connection with the
overall value of the Property for all purposes under this Section 5.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a material change of circumstances
not otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and which was not caused by
Seller's intentional breach of any of its obligations hereunder occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date which causes any of Seller's representations or
warranties set forth in Section 8.1 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) to become
untrue or in the event of an unintentional breach or unintentional default by
Seller which causes any of Seller's covenants to be in breach, in any event,
such that the failure or failures of all such



3721766.8

-11-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



representations and warranties to be so true and correct or such covenants to
be in breach would have a material adverse effect on the Property or the
purchase and sale agreement contemplated by this Agreement (a "Change of
Circumstances"), and, in either case, in the event that Buyer is not willing
to waive its objection thereto, Seller shall have a period of thirty (30) days
from the date of the discovery by Seller of such Change of Circumstances to
cure such untrue fact, condition or covenant (and the Closing Date shall be
extended to accommodate such cure period). If Seller does not cure such Change
of Circumstances within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer shall have the
right, as Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy hereunder for such failure, either
(a) to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which case,
this Agreement shall be null and void and of no further force or effect and
the parties hereto shall have no further obligations to the other and the
Deposit (less the Independent Consideration) shall be refunded to Buyer, or
(b) to waive the foregoing right of termination and all other rights and
remedies on account of such breach or default and to close the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3
to the contrary, the foregoing procedure with respect to a Change of
Circumstances shall not be applicable to the intentional breach by Seller of
any of its obligations hereunder, it being understood that the remedy for such
a breach by Seller shall be in accordance with Section 10.1 hereof and (ii) in
no event shall Buyer have the right to terminate this Agreement if any of
Seller's representations and warranties become untrue or Seller cannot perform
a covenant and any such matter does not have a material adverse effect on the
Property or the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement.

5.4 Performance by Buyer. The performance and observance, in all material
respects, by Buyer of all material covenants and agreements of this Agreement
to be performed or observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date under
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of the Purchase
Price to Seller, shall be a condition precedent to Seller's obligation to sell
the Property. In addition, a condition precedent to Seller's obligation to
sell the Property shall be that the representations and warranties of Buyer
are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as if
made on such Closing Date.

5.5 Consents. As a condition to Buyer's obligation to close and provided Buyer
cooperates with Hyatt Corporation in applying for and pursuing a transfer of
the Hotel Management Agreement, Seller shall furnish to Buyer, in form and
content reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, with a written consent from Hyatt
Corporation, as to the transfer to Buyer or its designee of Seller's interest
in the Hotel Management Agreement, with the form of the Hyatt Management
Agreement Assignment (as defined and described in Section 6.2.1(l) being
deemed acceptable to Buyer and Seller.

5.6 Hotel Management Agreement. As a condition to Buyer's obligation to close
and provided Buyer cooperates with Hyatt Corporation in applying for and
pursuing a transfer of the Hotel Management Agreement, Seller shall provide to
Buyer an estoppel certificate from the Manager with respect to the Hotel
Management Agreement (the "Hyatt Estoppel"). The Hyatt Estoppel shall certify
(a) a true and complete copy of the management agreement (or a listing of the
documents attendant thereto), (b) that the Hotel Management Agreement is in
full force and effect, (c) to the best of Manager's knowledge, the absence of
any events of default or the occurrence of any material events which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice would constitute an event of default
by either party under the Hotel Management Agreement, (d) the date through
which management fees are paid, and (e) such other matters reasonably
requested by Buyer prior to the Effective Date and for which Manager has an
obligation to provide in an estoppel certificate under



3721766.8

-12-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



the Hotel Management Agreement. A Buyer approved form of the Hyatt Estoppel is
attached hereto as Exhibit "S-3".

5.7 Consequence of Failure of a Closing Condition. If Seller has not satisfied
the contingencies contained in Section 5.5 and 5.6 by the time of Closing,
Seller shall have the right, by delivering written notice to Buyer prior to
3:00 p.m. on the Closing Date to extend the Closing Date for up to ten (10)
business days in order to satisfy such conditions to Closing. In no event
shall failure to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 5.5 or 5.6
constitute a default of Seller under this Agreement. If either Buyer or Seller
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5, then the
party exercising its termination rights hereunder shall notify in writing the
other party and Escrow Agent of such election (a "Section 5 Termination
Notice") prior to the Closing Date (or prior to the earlier date which may be
required for such termination under the terms of this Agreement), and the
specific condition or conditions giving rise to such election. If either party
shall deliver a Section 5 Termination Notice, and such notice is accompanied
by a demand that Escrow Agent deliver the Deposit to such party, Escrow Agent
shall promptly request from the non-requesting party written confirmation that
release of the Deposit to the requesting party is acceptable and upon receipt
of such written confirmation (or if no written confirmation or objection is
received within ten (10) business days of Escrow Agent's request therefor),
Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit, less the Independent Consideration
which shall be paid to Seller in all cases, to the requesting party as
demanded. If the non-requesting party raises an objection to release of the
Deposit, the procedures set forth in the Deposit Escrow Agreement shall govern
Escrow Agent's obligation to release the Deposit hereunder.

6\. Closing Procedure. The sale and purchase herein provided shall be
consummated (the "Closing") through and pursuant to the Escrow Instructions
(as defined below).

6.1 Escrow. On the Closing Date, the parties shall make the deliveries set
forth in Section 6.2 below into an escrow (the "Escrow") established pursuant
to escrow instructions ("Escrow Instructions") to be executed among Buyer,
Seller and Escrow Agent in the form of Exhibit "Q" attached hereto, as the
same may be amended by the agreement of the parties to conform to the facts
and circumstances of closing. The conditions to the closing of such escrow
shall include the Escrow Agent's receipt of the Closing Payment (or
confirmation of the receipt thereof by Seller) and a notice from each of Buyer
and Seller authorizing Escrow Agent to close the transactions as contemplated
herein (each of Buyer and Seller being obligated to deliver such authorization
notice on the Closing Date as soon as it is reasonably satisfied that the
other party is in a position to deliver the items to be delivered by such
other party under Section 6.2 below).

6.2 Delivery by Parties. On the Closing Date, the following items shall be
delivered by the parties, with Buyer and Seller cooperating in a commercially

Agreement Assignment, each of Buyer and Seller shall close the transaction

not provided:

6.4 Adjustments, Allocations and Prorations. The following provisions shall
govern the adjustments and prorations that shall be made at Closing and the
allocation of income and expenses from the Property between Seller and Buyer.
Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Section 6.4, all items of
revenue, cost and expense of the Property, with respect to the period on or
prior to 12:01 A.M. Mountain time (the "Cut-Off Time") on the Closing Date,
shall be for the account of Seller and all items of revenue, cost and expense
of the Property, with respect to the period from and after 12:01 A.M. Mountain
time on the Closing Date, shall be for the account of Buyer. Any net
adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be credited against the Purchase Price at
the Closing. Any net adjustment in favor of Seller shall be paid in cash or
cash equivalent at the Closing by Buyer to Seller.

6.4.1 Real Property Taxes, Personal Property Taxes, Impositions and Other
Assessments. All real property taxes, personal property taxes, assessments and
other governmental impositions of any kind or nature, shall be prorated at
Closing based on the most recent mill levy and assessment available. Such
proration shall be done in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) Allocation of Real Property Taxes, Personal Property Taxes, Impositions
and Other Assessments. Seller shall be responsible for all real property
taxes, personal property taxes, regardless of when payable and when billed,
impositions and other assessments that are attributable to the period prior to
the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for all real property taxes,
personal property taxes, regardless of when payable and when billed,
impositions and other assessments that are attributable to the period from and
after the Closing Date.

(b) Adjustment of Tax Rate or Assessment for other than Real Property Taxes.
If the personal property tax rate or any assessment has not been set for the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, then the proration of such personal
property tax or assessment shall be based upon the most recent mill levy and
assessment for the preceding fiscal year for such tax or assessment which has
not been set for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, and such
proration shall be promptly adjusted between Seller and Buyer upon
presentation of written evidence that the actual taxes or assessment paid
(determined as of the date such taxes or assessment are actually paid) for the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs differ from the amounts used at
Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any such
adjustment shall be completed and paid within one (1) year after the Closing
Date or the same shall be deemed waived.

(c) Final Reproration after Any Real Estate Tax Appeal. The parties
acknowledge that a protest will likely be filed by Buyer protesting the real
estate tax assessment for the year of Closing. Notwithstanding the fact that a
reproration of real estate taxes



3721766.8

-16-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



may occur within one (1) year after the Closing Date, the parties agree to a
final reproration of real estate taxes payable for the year of Closing based
on the final real estate taxes bill after the real estate tax assessment is
ultimately reduced for such period. Reasonable costs and expenses of the
parties in pursuing and collecting such tax reduction shall be included in
such reproration, but in no event shall Seller be responsible for any
additional amounts due to Buyer resulting from said reproration and the
inclusion of such costs. This Section 6.4.1(c) shall survive Closing.

6.4.2 Hotel Reservations and Revenues.

(a) Reservations. Buyer shall honor (and shall cause Manager to honor) all
reservations at the Property, and for any related conference, banquet, or
meeting space or any recreational facilities in connection with the Property
that are made by Seller or Manager on or prior to the Closing Date in the
ordinary course of business and pertain to periods on or after the Closing
Date. Any down payments and advance deposits that are (i) received by Seller
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) made with respect to confirmed reservations
for dates on or after the Closing Date, will be credited at Closing to Buyer.

(b) Guest Revenues. Revenues from guest rooms in the Property occupied as of
the Cut-Off Time, including any sales taxes, room taxes and other taxes
charged to guests in such rooms, all parking charges, sales from mini bars,
in-room food and beverage, telephone, facsimile and data communications, in-
room movie, laundry, and other service charges allocated to such rooms with
respect to the night prior to the Closing Date shall be split equally between
Buyer and Seller. All other revenues from restaurants, lounges, and other
service operations conducted at the Property shall be allocated based on
whether the same accrued before or from and after the Cut-Off Time, and Seller
shall instruct Manager to separately record sales occurring before and from
and after the Cut-Off Time.

(c) Banquet and Meeting Room Revenues. Revenues from conferences, receptions,
meetings, and other functions occurring in any conference, banquet or meeting
rooms in the Property, including usage charges and related taxes, food and
beverage sales, valet parking charges, equipment rentals, and
telecommunications charges, shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer, based
on when the function therein commenced, with (i) one-day functions commencing
prior to the Cut-Off Time being allocable to Seller; (ii) one-day functions
commencing on or after the Closing Date being allocable to Buyer and (iii)
multi day functions that include periods both before and after the Cut-Off
Time being prorated between Seller and Buyer according to the period of time
before and from and after the Cut-Off Time.

(d) Gift Certificates and Vouchers. Buyer shall receive a credit for the
amount of (and shall honor to the extent of the credit) any outstanding,
verifiable vouchers and gift certificates which have not been redeemed or used
at the Property prior to the Closing Date.

6.4.3 House Banks and Cash on Hand (Other Than Bank Accounts [as defined
below]). The aggregate amount of cash in the house banks and cash on hand as
of the Closing Date shall be referred to as the "Aggregate Cash Amount". The
Aggregate Cash Amount shall belong to Buyer. Seller shall receive a credit for
the same at Closing.

6.4.4 Hotel Management Fees, Deposits and Reserves. Seller and Buyer shall
prorate the "Basic Fee" and "Chain Service Charges" (as those terms are
defined



3721766.8

-17-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



in the Hotel License Agreement) and other administrative fees and charges
payable to Manager for the month in which the Closing occurs, on the basis
that Seller is responsible for the portion of such Basic Fee calculated on
"Gross Receipts" (as defined in the Hotel License Agreement) for such month
received prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer is responsible for the portion
of the Basic Fee calculated on the Gross Receipts for such month received on
and after the Closing Date, and such other charges and amounts shall be
prorated on a daily basis during the month of Closing. Accordingly, (a) if
Manager has been paid prior to the Closing Date Basic Fees and other fees
under the Hotel Management Agreement greater than the Basic Fee allocable to
Seller during its period of ownership and as aforesaid, Seller shall receive a
credit on account thereof, and (b) if Manager has been paid prior to the
Closing Date Basic Fees less than the Basic Fees allocable to Seller as
aforesaid, Buyer shall receive a credit on account thereof. Seller and Buyer
shall also prorate the "Incentive Fee" (as that term is defined in the Hotel
License Agreement) payable to Manager for calendar year 2017, as re-forecasted
by Manager on an annual basis for 2017 from time to time, on a daily basis for
calendar year 2017 (i.e., divided by 365 days) such that Seller's share is the
number of days prior to the Closing Date and Buyer's share is the balance of
such amount. Based on the foregoing proration, Buyer shall be responsible for
the payment of any Incentive Fees (including, without limitation, Additional
Incentive Fees and Deferred Incentive Fees) that are due or payable to Manager
on or after the date of this Agreement. In addition, the aggregate amount of
any deposits, working capital or reserves held by Manager under the Hotel
License Agreement (including, without limitation, the "FFE and Fund" [as defined
in the Hotel License Agreement]) shall belong to Buyer, and Seller shall
receive a credit for the same at Closing. In addition, Seller shall receive a
credit at Closing in the amount of any FFandE, routine or other capital
improvements reserves and any other reserve funds held under or pursuant to
the Hotel License Agreement so long as such funds remain on deposit after
Closing for the benefit of Buyer.

6.4.5 Hotel Receivables. Except for Over 60 Day Accounts Receivables (as
hereinafter defined), all accounts receivables, including, without limitation,
credit card sales ("Accounts Receivables"), with respect to the Property shall
belong to Buyer and Seller shall receive a credit at Closing for same.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall retain all accounts receivables
that are outstanding for more than sixty (60) days on the Closing Date ("Over
60 Day Accounts Receivables") and Buyer shall not be obligated to acquire the
same from Seller. Accordingly, there will be no proration for Over 60 Day
Accounts Receivables. To the extent the Buyer receives payments on account of
Over 60 Day Accounts Receivables, Buyer shall promptly pay any such amounts to
Seller, as and when such amount is received by Buyer, net of third party
collection costs. Buyer shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts, but
shall have no obligation to institute litigation, to collect the Over 60 Day
Accounts Receivables. All payments of accounts receivable received after the
Closing shall be first deemed payment of current receivables and then to Over
60 Day Accounts Receivables, to the extent the payment is made by a party
which directly or indirectly has a balance outstanding to Seller, as
reasonably determined by the Buyer.

6.4.6 Purchase of Unopened Wine and Liquor Inventory. As of the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall jointly conduct
(or ask Manager to conduct) an inventory of all unopened wine and liquor
inventory and shall deliver a written report thereon to Seller and Buyer. Such
report shall reflect the value of the unopened wine and liquor inventory equal
to Seller's cost as reflected on the books of Seller. On account of Buyer's
purchase of the unopened wine and liquor inventory, Seller shall receive a
credit at

* * *



Closing in an amount equal to such cost of the unopened wine and liquor
inventory as reflected on the books of Seller (such adjustment being referred
to herein as an "Inventory Adjustment"). In addition to the Purchase Price,
Buyer shall separately pay Seller, at Closing, Seller's (or Manager's, if
applicable) cost of all unopened wine and liquor inventory. Inventory shall be
considered "unopened" even if the packaging shall have been opened for
purposes of assessing or affixing tax stamps.

6.4.7 Operational Taxes. The parties acknowledge that certain taxes accrue and
are payable to the various local governments by any business entity operating
a hotel and its related facilities. Included in those taxes may be business
and occupation taxes, retail sales and use taxes, gross receipts taxes, and
other special lodging or hotel taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, all of
such taxes (expressly excluding taxes and assessments covered by Section
6.4.1, corporate franchise taxes, and federal, state, and local income taxes)
(hereinafter referred to as "Operational Taxes") shall be allocated between
Seller and Buyer such that those attributable to the period prior to the Cut-
Off Time shall be allocable to Seller and those attributable to the period
from and after the Cut-Off Time shall be allocable to Buyer (with the
attribution of such taxes hereunder to be done in a manner consistent with the
attribution under this Agreement of the applicable revenues on which such
taxes may be based). Buyer shall receive a credit for any Operational Taxes
attributable to the period prior to the Cut-Off Time which Seller has not paid
and which Buyer is obligated to pay. Except for the Operational Taxes for
which Buyer has received a credit under this Section 6.4.7, Seller shall be
solely responsible for payment of the Operational Taxes with respect to the
period prior to the Cut-Off Time, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for
payment of such Operational Taxes with respect to the period after the Cut-Off
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operational Taxes due and payable for
the night prior to the Closing Date shall be split equally between Buyer and
Seller.

6.4.8 Wages and Other Employee Compensation. Buyer acknowledges that employees
of the Property are the employees of Manager and not of Seller, and that Buyer
has no right to cause the termination of such employees. In no event shall
Buyer take any action as to such employees of Manager that would create or
cause any liability to Seller. Seller shall be responsible for all wages,
salaries, bonuses, employment taxes and withholding taxes to the extent
attributable to the period prior to Closing, and Buyer shall be responsible
for all wages, salaries, any bonuses, employment taxes and withholding taxes
to the extent attributable to the period from and after Closing, and Buyer
shall be responsible for any and all vacation days, sick days and personal
days, if applicable, existing on or accruing on or after the Closing Date.
From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and save Seller harmless
from and against any claim by any employee arising from Buyer's actions and
omissions as to any employees of Manager. The provisions of this Section 6.4.8
shall apply only to employees who are employed at the Property as of Closing.

6.4.9 Permits; Contracts; Rebates. Permit and license fees of assignable
permits and licenses which are assigned to Buyer or for which the Buyer
acquires the Property subject to, if any, shall be prorated as of the Closing
Date. Payments due under the Continuing Agreements and Equipment Leases shall
be prorated as of the Closing Date. Rebates received by Buyer after the
Closing for purchases made prior to the Closing shall be paid by Buyer to
Seller promptly as and when received.

6.4.10 Assessments Under the Condominium Declaration. All "Assessments" (as
defined in the Condominium Declaration) under the Condominium Declaration, if
any, shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller, Seller being charged and
credited for all of the same allocable to the period up to the Closing Date
and Buyer being charged and credited for all of the same allocable to the
period from and after the Closing Date. Seller shall also receive a credit at
Closing for its prorata share of any operating, capital or other reserves
being held by the Condominium Association, to the extent such funds remain for
the benefit of Buyer at Closing.

6.4.11 Other Property Operating Expenses. Operating expenses and utility
charges (subject to this Section 6.4.11 and Section 6.4.13 below) and expenses
under any condominium association documents affecting the Property, management
agreements assigned to Buyer or its designee, off-site facility agreements
assigned to Buyer or its designee, Continuing Agreements and Equipment leases,
reciprocal easement agreements, shared use, or operating agreements (if any)
with respect to private roadways, parking, recreational, or other facilities
(to the extent any such expenses or charges are not allocated under the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6) shall be prorated between Seller and
Buyer by allocating to Seller those expenses attributable to the period prior
to the Closing Date, and allocating to Buyer those expenses attributable for
any period from and after the Closing Date. Buyer shall receive a credit at
Closing for operating and other expenses incurred but not paid prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall receive a credit for Seller's share of such
expenses paid by Seller prior to the Closing, to the extent allocable to
expenses that will be incurred on or after the Closing Date. To the extent
that the amount of actual consumption of any utility services is not
determined prior to the Closing Date, as provided in Section 6.4.13 below, a
proration shall be made at Closing based on the last available reading and
post-closing adjustments between Buyer and Seller shall be made within twenty
(20) days of the date that actual consumption for such pre-Closing period is
determined, which obligation shall survive the Closing and not be merged
therein. Any tour agents' and travel agents' commissions shall be prorated as
of the Closing Date.

6.4.12 Indemnification. In any case in which Buyer receives a credit at
Closing on account of any obligation of Seller hereunder, Seller shall have no
further liability for such obligation to the extent of the credit so given,
and Buyer shall pay and discharge the same up to the amount of the credit.
Buyer and Seller shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other party
harmless from and against any claim arising from the non-payment of any of the
items for which the indemnifying party receives a credit, but only to the
extent of the amount of such credit, or otherwise assumes or retains
responsibility for payment pursuant to this Section 6.4, plus penalties,
fines, fees, interest and other charges thereon or related thereto imposed by
third parties or by law in connection with such non-payment.

6.4.13 Items for Which There Will Not be a Proration. Seller and Buyer agree
that (a) other than pursuant to Section 7, none of the insurance policies
relating to the Property will be assigned to Buyer, and Buyer shall be
responsible for arranging for its own insurance as of the Closing Date; and
(b) utilities, including telephone, electricity, water and gas, shall be read
on the Closing Date and Buyer shall be responsible for all the necessary
actions needed to arrange for utilities to be transferred to the name of Buyer
beginning 12:01 A.M. Mountain time on the Closing Date, including the posting
of any required deposits. Accordingly, there will be no prorations for
insurance or utilities (unless, with respect to a



3721766.8

-20-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



particular utility, (i) a meter reading is unavailable, in which case such
utility shall be prorated in the manner provided in Section 6.4.11 above; or
(ii) the Title Company reasonably requires it), and Seller shall be entitled
to any refund in connection with termination of Seller's existing insurance
policies. To the extent reasonably possible, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
to arrange for utility and other service providers to separately bill each
party for their respective periods of ownership, in which event no credit and
no proration will be necessary. Seller shall be entitled to receive and be
returned any deposits Seller may have with any utility companies, or will
receive a credit at Closing from Buyer to the extent such deposits remain for
the benefit of Buyer from and after Closing.

6.4.14 Closing Statement; Post-Closing Adjustments. The prorations and credits
hereunder at the Closing shall be made based on a closing statement (the
"Closing Statement") to be prepared by Seller prior to the Closing, based on
actual figures to the extent available. If any of the prorations cannot be
calculated based on actual figures, then they shall be calculated based on the
Seller's good faith estimates thereof. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing, Buyer shall prepare and submit to Seller a recalculation of the
prorations and credits hereunder, reflecting actual figures and not estimates
(other than with respect to those expenses for which a final bill has not been
received). With respect to those prorations and credits which are not
determinable as of such 90-day period, the parties shall recalculate such
prorations and credits thirty (30) days prior to the Survival Period, except
for real estate taxes, which shall be subject to proration for a period of one
(1) year after the Closing Date. Such recalculation shall be binding on Buyer
and Seller unless Seller delivers to Buyer, within ten (10) days after Seller
has received such recalculation, a notice ("Audit Notice") stating Seller does
not agree with such calculations, and, if such notice is given, KPMG, LLP (the
"Accounting Firm") shall be engaged to make the final determination of such
prorations and credits. The fees and costs of the Accounting Firm in making
such determination shall be split equally between the parties. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith and act reasonably after Closing to
assist Manager and Accounting Firm in their determinations.

6.4.15 Survival of Section 6.4. The obligations and rights of the parties
under this Section 6.4 shall survive the Closing.

7\. Condemnation or Destruction of Property. In the event that, after the
date hereof but prior to the Closing Date, either any portion of the Property
is taken pursuant to eminent domain proceedings, or any of the improvements on
the Property are damaged or destroyed by any casualty, Seller shall not have
any obligation to repair or replace any such damage or destruction, but Seller
shall be required to give Buyer written notice of the same within five (5)
business days after Seller learns of such casualty or condemnation. Seller
shall also deliver and assign to Buyer, upon consummation of the transaction
herein provided (except to the extent any condemnation proceeds or insurance
proceeds are attributable to lost rents or revenues or other items applicable
to any period prior to the Closing), and subject to the requirements of the
Condominium Declaration, all claims of Seller respecting any condemnation or
casualty insurance coverage, as applicable, and all condemnation proceeds, or
proceeds from any such casualty insurance received by Seller on account of any
casualty (except to the extent required for collection costs or repairs by
Seller prior to the Closing Date), as applicable. There shall be no reduction
of the Purchase Price on account of any casualty or condemnation (except that
in connection with a casualty covered by insurance, Buyer shall be credited
with the lesser of the remaining cost to repair the damage or destruction
caused by such casualty or the amount of the deductible under Seller's
casualty insurance policy [except to the



3721766.8

-21-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



extent such deductible was expended by Seller to repair the resulting
damage]). In the event the condemnation award or the cost of repair of damage
to the Property on account of a casualty, as applicable, shall exceed five
percent (5%) of the Purchase Price (or if a casualty is uninsured and Seller
does not elect to credit Buyer with an amount equal to the cost to repair such
uninsured casualty, Seller having the right, but not the obligation, to do
so), either Buyer or Seller may, at its option terminate this Agreement by
notice to the other party, given on or before the sooner to occur of the
Closing Date or five (5) business days after Seller learns of such casualty or
condemnation, in which event the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration)
shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further obligation
hereunder except for those obligations which expressly survive a termination
of this Agreement.

warranty or covenant, and specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such
breach. Buyer shall allow Seller sixty (60) days after Buyer's notice within
which to cure such breach or if such breach cannot be cured within such sixty
(60) day period, and Seller notifies Buyer it wishes to extend its cure period
(the "Cure Extension Notice"), such additional reasonable period of time (not
to exceed an additional sixty (60) days) as is required to cure the same so
long as such cure has been commenced within such sixty (60) day period and is
being diligently pursued to completion. If Seller fails to cure such breach
after written notice thereof, Buyer's sole remedy shall be to commence a legal
proceeding against Seller alleging that Seller has breached such
representation, warranty or covenant and that Buyer has suffered actual
damages as a result thereof (a "Proceeding"), which Proceeding must be
commenced, if at all, within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
Survival Period, provided, however, that if Buyer gives Seller written notice
of such a breach within the Survival Period, and Seller subsequently sends a
Cure Extension Notice, then Buyer shall have until the date which is thirty
(30) days after the date Seller notifies Buyer it has ceased endeavoring to
cure such breach, to commence such Proceeding. If Buyer shall have timely
delivered the written notice and commenced a Proceeding in accordance with
this Section 8.3, and a court of competent jurisdiction shall, pursuant to a
final, non-appealable order in connection with such Proceeding, determine that
(1) Seller was in breach of the applicable representation or warranty as of
the Effective Date or the Closing Date, as the case may be, and (2) Buyer
suffered actual damages (the "Damages") by reason of such breach, (3) Buyer
did not have actual knowledge of such breach on or prior to the Closing Date,
and (4) Buyer would not have learned of such breach through the exercise of
reasonable diligence prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be entitled
to receive an amount equal to the Damages, subject, in any event, to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5. Any such Damages, subject to the
limitations contained herein, shall be paid within thirty (30) days following
the entry of such final, non-appealable order and delivery of a copy thereof
to Seller. The representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer under this
Agreement, and in any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith, shall survive the Closing indefinitely. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
the matters under Section 6.4 of this Agreement shall not be subject to the
Survival Period and shall survive the Closing for the periods provided in
Section 6.4 and (ii) insured claims against Seller or Manager for matters
accruing or arising prior to the Closing Date shall survive Closing without
limitation.

8.3.2 Holdback Deposit. Seller and Buyer agree that at Closing, upon the
consummation of the transaction provided for by this Agreement and pursuant to
the applicable terms of the "Post-Closing Escrow Agreement" attached hereto as
Exhibit "R", a portion of the proceeds of the Purchase Price payable to Seller
equal to Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($3,750,000.00) (the "Holdback Deposit") shall be retained by Title Company
for the Survival Period. The Holdback Deposit shall be released or retained in
accordance with the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement. Upon the expiration of the
Survival Period all Seller's representations and warranties shall cease to
have any effect unless written notice of a claim has been previously given (in
which case, such claim shall survive until fully and finally resolved).

8.4 Knowledge as a Defense. Seller shall have no liability with respect to a
breach of the representations and warranties of Seller under this Agreement to
the extent that Buyer proceeds with the closing of the transaction
contemplated hereby with actual knowledge of such breach prior to the Closing
Date.

8.5 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Seller's liability for breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement and in Seller
Executed Closing Documents, (other than Seller's obligations under Section 6.4
and insured claims against Seller or Manager for matters accruing or arising
prior to the Closing Date, to which the limitations under this Section 8.5
shall not apply) or any other instruments delivered at Closing, shall, subject
to the limitations of survival set forth in this Section 8, be limited to
claims in excess of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 United States
Dollars ($150,000.00) in the aggregate, and the total aggregate liability of
Seller for any and all claims arising out of any such covenants,
representations and warranties shall not exceed an amount equal to Three
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars
($3,750,000.00). In addition, in no event shall Seller be liable for any
incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary damages,
or for lost profits, unrealized expectations or other similar claims, and in
every case Buyer's recovery for any claims referenced above shall be net of
any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment recovered or recoverable by Buyer from any insurance company or other
third party.

9\. Certain Covenants of Seller and Buyer.

9.1 No Further Encumbering. Until the Closing Date or the sooner termination
of this Agreement, Seller shall not further encumber the Property with any
mortgages or deeds of trust.

9.2 WARN ACT. As set forth above in Section 6.4.8, Buyer acknowledges that
employees of the Property are the employees of Manager and not of Seller, and
that Buyer has no right to cause the termination of such employees. In no
event shall Buyer take any action, or permit Manager to take any action, at
Closing or within ninety (90) days after Closing as to such employees of
Manager that would create or cause any WARN Act (hereinafter defined)
liability to Seller or Manager. Without limitation on the generality of the
foregoing, Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the employees of Manager will not
be terminated at Closing, as the Hotel Management Agreement is remaining in
existence and, as a result, the United States Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act") or any applicable state law will not be
triggered. Buyer shall indemnify, save, defend and hold Seller and the Seller
Related Parties harmless from and against any and all liability under the WARN
Act and applicable state law resulting from any termination from and after
Closing of employees of the Property at any time after Closing Date. The
provisions of this Section 9.2 shall survive the Closing.

9.3 Operations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4 below:

9.3.1 Property Maintenance. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with its past practices to cause the Manager to operate and
maintain the Property in the same manner as prior hereto pursuant to its
normal course of business (such obligation to include the maintenance of
casualty and liability insurance policies in accordance with Seller's normal
course of business, but such obligation to not include capital expenditures or
expenditures not incurred in such normal course of business), subject to
reasonable wear

and tear and further subject to destruction by casualty or eminent domain or
other events beyond the control of Seller or Manager, including changes in
laws, rules, ordinances and regulations.

9.3.2 Contracts and Agreements. Seller shall not enter or permit Manager to
enter (where Seller has the right under the Hotel Management Agreement to
prohibit Manager from doing so) into any additional service contracts,
equipment leases or other similar agreements that will be binding upon Buyer
without the prior consent of Buyer; provided, however, without the consent of
Buyer, Seller may, or permit Manager to, enter into service contracts,
equipment leases and other agreements which are cancelable on thirty (30)
days' notice. Any additional service contracts, equipment lease and other
agreements entered into in accordance with this Section 9.3.2 shall constitute
Continuing Agreements and Equipment Leases being assigned to Buyer on the
Closing Date.

9.3.3 Safe Deposit Boxes. Any property contained in the safe deposit boxes as
of Closing shall be the responsibility of Buyer, and Buyer shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Seller Related Parties from and
against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising
out of or with respect to such property. The provisions of this Section 9.3.3
shall survive the Closing.

9.3.4 Baggage Inventory. The representatives of Seller and Buyer shall prepare
the inventory as of day immediately preceding the Closing Date (which
inventory shall be binding on all parties thereto) of (a) all luggage, valises
and trunks checked or left in the care of the Property by guests then or
formerly in the Property, (b) parcels, laundry, valet packages and other
property of guests checked or left in the care of the Property by guests then
or formerly in the Property (excluding, however, property in the safe deposit
boxes), (c) all luggage or other property of guests retained by Buyer, and (d)
all items contained in the lost and found. Buyer shall be responsible from and
after the Closing Date for all baggage, and other items listed in such
inventory. The provisions of this Section 9.3.4 shall survive the Closing.

9.3.5 Approval Standard. All approvals by Buyer under this Section 9.3 shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limitation on
the foregoing, if Seller delivers a written request to Buyer for Buyer's
approval of any matter for which Buyer's approval is required under this
Section 9.3 (an "Approval Request"), and Buyer fails to deliver to Seller its
written disapproval of such Approval Request within five (5) business days
after its receipt of such Approval Request, then Buyer shall be deemed to have
approved the matter that is the subject of such Approval Request.

9.4 Hotel Management Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges that Manager has certain rights
under the Hotel Management Agreement, including without limitation, the right
to execute certain contracts and other agreements and to take certain actions
with respect to the Property, and the performance of Manager's rights and
obligations under the Hotel Management Agreement shall not result in a breach
by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement, unless Seller's consent to
such actions is required by the terms of the Hotel Management Agreement and
such consent is granted in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement. Any additional service contracts and equipment leases entered
into by Manager on behalf of Seller prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with the terms of the Hotel Management
Agreement, shall constitute



3721766.8

Continuing Agreements and Equipment Leases on the Closing Date. Between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, the hiring and employment policies with
respect to employees of Manager at the Property shall remain within the sole
control of Manager. Manager shall remain the sole judge of the fitness and
qualifications of such employees and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Manager is vested with such discretion in hiring, supervising, directing,
discharging and determining the compensation, other benefits and terms of
employment of such employees, as is set forth in the Hotel Management
Agreement.

9.5 Independent Audit. Seller will engage, at Buyer's cost, a third party
accounting firm ("GAAP Preparer") to prepare financial statements (including
footnotes) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") for the Property for calendar years 2015, 2016 and for 2017 through
any full completed Seller fiscal quarter ("GAAP Financials") and to provide
such GAAP Financials to Buyer and Buyer's independent accounting firm
("Auditor" with the Accounting Firm being an Auditor acceptable to the
parties). Seller will (a) engage the Auditor (at Buyer's request to expedite
the engagement process and at Buyer's cost), (b) reasonably cooperate with the
Auditor, and (c) provide the Auditor with such information regarding the GAAP
Financials as the Auditor may reasonably request, so that the Auditor may
complete an audit of the GAAP Financials for calendar years 2015 and 2016 and
a review for the period in 2017 through any full completed Seller fiscal
quarter. The parties intend that Buyer's audit will be completed on or before
June 1, 2017 and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist in such process. Seller shall also provide the Auditor with a signed
representation letter in a form acceptable to Seller. Seller shall authorize
any attorneys who have represented Seller or its management company in
material litigation pertaining to or affecting the Property to respond, at
Buyers expense, to inquiries from the Auditor. For the purposes of this
provision, material litigation includes matters with liability exceeding
$50,000. In order to prepare GAAP Financials for the stated periods, Buyer
will engage a third party valuation company, at Buyers expense (with Cushman and
Wakefield being a third party acceptable to the parties), to (i) establish for
Seller a purchase price allocation ("PPA") to be recorded in the GAAP
Financials as of the date Seller acquired the Property and (ii) create current
purchase price allocations as of the Closing Date for Buyer's purposes only,
such allocations under (ii) not being binding on Seller for any reason. The
Buyer will deliver to Seller the PPA no later than March 27, 2017 so that
Seller and GAAP Preparer may prepare and record Seller's acquisition
transaction for GAAP purposes and produce a set of GAAP Financials for said
periods for audit and review by Auditor. Buyer agrees to provide technical
accounting assistance to Seller and GAAP Preparer as needed in order to
prepare the GAAP Financials. Immediately after the Effective Date Seller shall
provide to the preparer of the PPA on a confidential basis, a copy of the
closing documents utilized when the Property was originally acquired by
Seller, as well as the documents that may be reasonably be required to prepare
the PPA. This Section 9.5 shall survive Closing.

10. DISPOSITION OF DEPOSIT.

10.1 IF THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL NOT BE CLOSED BY REASON OF
SELLER'S DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FAILURE OF SATISFACTION OF THE
CONDITIONS BENEFITING BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERMITTED TERMINATION
OF THIS AGREEMENT BY BUYER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THEN THE DEPOSIT
SHALL BE RETURNED TO BUYER, AND NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER OBLIGATION OR
LIABILITY TO THE OTHER (EXCEPT UNDER THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT
EXPRESSLY SURVIVE A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT);



3721766.8

-35-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF THE CONDITION WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFIED IS A BREACH
OF A REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT, THEN BUYER, AT ITS OPTION, MAY
ELECT TO (I) ENFORCE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, OR (II) TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT
WHEREUPON THE DEPOSIT (LESS THE INDEPENDENT CONSIDERATION) SHALL BE RETURNED
TO BUYER AND, IF THE DEFAULT BY SELLER WAS AN INTENTIONAL ACT OF SELLER,
SELLER SHALL BE OBLIGATED UPON DEMAND TO REIMBURSE BUYER UP TO TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($200,000.00) IN THE AGGREGATE FOR BUYER'S ACTUAL OUT-OF-
POCKET INSPECTION, FINANCING AND OTHER COSTS RELATED TO BUYER'S ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT, INSPECTING THE PROPERTY AND PREPARING FOR A CLOSING OF THE
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BUYER'S
ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION, NEGOTIATION AND
EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN CONNECTION WITH BUYER'S DUE DILIGENCE
REVIEW, AUDITS AND PREPARATION FOR A CLOSING, AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER AND BUYER HEREUNDER (EXCEPT THOSE SET FORTH HEREIN WHICH
EXPRESSLY SURVIVE A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT) SHALL TERMINATE
IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER, ANY ACTION IN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MUST BE FILED, IF AT
ALL, WITHIN 45 DAYS AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

10.2 IN THE EVENT THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL FAIL TO CLOSE BY
REASON OF DEFAULT BY BUYER (INCLUDING A BREACH BY BUYER OF A REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY), THEN THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE DELIVERED TO SELLER AS FULL COMPENSATION
AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES UNDER AND IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND IN
SUCH EVENT, BUYER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO SELLER FOR MONETARY DAMAGES EXCEPT
FOR FORFEITURE OF THE DEPOSIT (AND AS PROVIDED UNDER THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT). IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE THAT SELLER WILL INCUR
EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT;
FURTHER, THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND
IMPRACTICABLE TO ASCERTAIN WITH ANY ACCURACY THE EXTENT OF DETRIMENT TO SELLER
CAUSED BY THE BREACH BY BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE FAILURE OF THE
CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE AMOUNT
OF COMPENSATION SELLER SHOULD RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF BUYER'S BREACH OR
DEFAULT, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION
REPRESENTS BOTH PARTIES' EFFORTS TO APPROXIMATE SUCH POTENTIAL DAMAGES. IN THE
EVENT THE SALE CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL NOT BE CONSUMMATED ON ACCOUNT OF
BUYER'S DEFAULT, THEN THE RETENTION OF THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE SELLER'S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BY REASON OF SUCH DEFAULT AND THE
PARTIES SHALL TAKE SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO CAUSE THE DEPOSIT TO BE
DELIVERED TO SELLER. SELLER AGREES THAT IN THE EVENT IT IS ENTITLED TO THE
DEPOSIT, THE FORFEIT OF THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES MEANS THAT BUYER'S
AGGREGATE



3721766.8

LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH BUYER'S BREACH IS THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT AND

10.3 IN THE EVENT THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL CLOSE, THE DEPOSIT
SHALL BE APPLIED AS A PARTIAL PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

11. Tax Reduction Proceedings. Seller (or Manager) may file and/or prosecute an application for the reduction of the assessed valuation of the Property or any portion thereof for real estate taxes or a refund of real estate taxes previously paid. The amount of any tax refunds (net of attorneys' fees and other costs of obtaining such tax refunds) with respect to any Property for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer. Tax refunds for any year prior to the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs shall belong entirely to Seller. If, in lieu of a tax refund for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs or a prior tax year, a tax credit is received for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs or subsequent tax year, then (x) within thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, of evidence of the actual amount of such tax credit (net of attorneys' fees and other costs of obtaining such tax credit), the tax credit apportionment shall be readjusted between Seller and Buyer and (y) upon realization by Buyer of a tax savings on account of such credit, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the savings realized (as apportioned). All refunds, credits or other benefits applicable to any fiscal period prior to the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs shall belong solely to Seller (and Buyer shall have no interest therein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11 to the contrary, Buyer shall have the right to approve the party retained by Seller (or Manager) for the tax appeal for the year of Closing and the right to approve any fee arrangement with respect thereto. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the Closing.

12. Miscellaneous.

been engaged by it in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or to its knowledge is in any way connected with any of such
transactions. Except as provided in Section 12.1.2 below, Seller represents
and warrants to Buyer that no broker or finder has been engaged by it in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
its knowledge is in any way connected with any of such transactions. In the
event of a claim for broker's or finder's fee or commissions in connection
herewith, then Seller shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold Buyer harmless
from and against the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement
alleged to have been made by Seller, and Buyer shall indemnify, protect,
defend and hold Seller harmless from and against the same if it shall be based

12.1.2 CBRE, Inc. ("Seller's Broker") has been engaged by Seller in connection
with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and without limitation on
the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if and only if the transaction
contemplated hereby shall close in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller shall pay Seller's Broker a commission pursuant to a
separate agreement between Seller and Seller's Broker.

12.2 Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer each covenant and agree to sign,
execute and deliver, or cause to be signed, executed and delivered, and to do
or make, or cause to be done or made, upon the written request of the other
party, any and all agreements, instruments, papers, deeds, acts or things,
supplemental, confirmatory or otherwise, as may be reasonably required by
either party hereto for the purpose of or in connection with consummating the
transactions described herein. The provisions of this Section 12.2 shall
survive Closing.

12.3 Confidentiality. Except as hereinafter provided, from and after the
execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall keep the terms, conditions
and provisions of this Agreement confidential and neither shall make any
public announcements hereof unless the other first approves of same in
writing, nor shall either disclose the terms, conditions and provisions
hereof, except to persons who "need to know," such as their respective
officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants, engineers, surveyors,
consultants, financiers, partners, investors, potential lessees and bankers
and such other third parties whose assistance is required in connection with
the consummation of this transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
acknowledged that Buyer is, or is an affiliate of, a real estate investment
trust (the "REIT"), and the REIT has and will seek to sell shares to the
general public; consequently, Buyer shall have the right to disclose any
information regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (other
than the identity of the Seller or any of its affiliated entities) solely if
disclosure is required by law or otherwise been determined to be necessary or
appropriate by Buyer or Buyer's attorneys to satisfy disclosure and reporting
obligations of Buyer or its affiliates. On or at any time following the
Effective Date, Buyer may make a press release and/or file with the United
States Securities Exchange Commission information regarding the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement other than the identity of the Seller or any of
its affiliated entities. Seller and Buyer and their representatives are
cautioned that United States securities laws restrict the purchase and sale of
securities by anyone who possesses non-public information about the issue of
such securities. Accordingly, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor its
representatives may buy or sell any of the securities of the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates so long as any of them is in possession of any material non-
public information about the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including
information contained in or derived from confidential information.

12.4 Cumulative Remedies. No remedy conferred upon a party in this Agreement
is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law provided or
permitted, but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or
by statute (except as otherwise expressly herein provided).

12.5 No Waiver. No waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement or of any
warranty or representation hereunder by the other party shall be deemed to be
a waiver of any other breach by such other party (whether preceding or
succeeding and whether or not of the same or similar nature), and no
acceptance of payment or performance by a party after any breach by the other
party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of this Agreement or of any
representation or warranty hereunder by such other party, whether or not the
first party knows of such breach at the time it accepts such payment or
performance. No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right it

-38-

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



may have by reason of the default of the other party shall operate as a waiver
of default or modification of this Agreement or shall prevent the exercise of
any right by the first party while the other party continues to be so in
default.

12.6 Consents and Approvals. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
any approval or consent provided to be given by a party hereunder must be in
writing to be effective and may be given or withheld in the absolute
discretion of such party.

12.7 Intentionally Deleted.

12.8 Modification. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by
written agreement signed by all parties.

contemplated by this Agreement and the delivery and recordation of the Deed.

Agreement shall survive the Closing; and (b) the indemnification obligations
set forth in Sections 3.1.5, 12.1, 12.3 and 12.11 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

12.10 Post-Closing Access. For a period of three (3) years subsequent to the
Closing Date, Seller and its employees, agents and representatives shall be
entitled to access during business hours to all documents, books and records
given to Buyer by Seller for tax and audit purposes, regulatory compliance,
and cooperation with governmental investigations upon reasonable prior notice
to Buyer, and shall have the right to make copies of such documents, books and
records at Seller's expense. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any loss, cost,
damage or expense resulting from any such access. The provisions of this
Section 12.10 shall survive Closing.

12.11 Indemnification Obligations. The indemnification obligations under this
Agreement shall be subject to the following provisions:

12.11.1 The party seeking indemnification ("Indemnitee") shall notify the
other party ("Indemnitor") of any claim against Indemnitee within forty-five
(45) days after it has notice of such claim, but failure to notify Indemnitor

unless Indemnitor shall be prejudiced by such failure and then only to the
extent of such prejudice. Should Indemnitor fail to discharge or undertake to
defend Indemnitee against such liability (with counsel reasonably approved by
Indemnitee), within thirty (30) days after Indemnitee gives Indemnitor written
notice of the same, then Indemnitee may settle such claim, and Indemnitor's
liability to Indemnitee shall be conclusively established by such settlement,

the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by
Indemnitee in effecting such settlement. Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless: (a) the employment of
such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by Indemnitor in connection
with the defense of such action, (b) Indemnitor shall not have employed
counsel to direct the defense of such action, or (c) Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to Indemnitor (in which case
Indemnitor shall not have the right

Gardere01 - 10003657v.4

* * *



to direct the defense of such action or of Indemnitee), in any of which events
such fees and expenses shall be borne by Indemnitor.

12.11.2 The indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall cover the
costs and expenses of Indemnitee, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
related to any actions, suits or judgments incident to any of the matters
covered by such indemnities.

12.11.3 The indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall also extend
to cover any claim against any present or future advisor, trustee, director,
officer, partner, member, manager, employee, beneficiary, shareholder,
fiduciary, participant or agent of or in Indemnitee or any entity now or
hereafter having a direct or indirect ownership interest in Indemnitee.

12.11.4 Except for obligations expressly assumed or agreed to be assumed by
Buyer hereunder, including without limitation those under the Hotel Management
Agreement in accordance with the Hyatt Management Agreement Assignment, Buyer
is not assuming any obligations of Seller or any liability for claims arising
out of any act, omission or occurrence which occurs, accrues or arises prior
to the Closing Date, and Seller hereby indemnifies and holds Buyer harmless

Closing Date including, without limitation, employee liability and liability
under any agreements assumed by Buyer at Closing, or (3) liability arising

duties, obligations and liabilities of Assignor arising and accruing on or

12.13 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Colorado (without regard to
conflicts of law). The parties hereto agree to submit to personal jurisdiction
in the State of Colorado in any action or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement and, in furtherance of such agreement, the parties hereby agree and
consent that without limiting other methods of obtaining jurisdiction,
personal jurisdiction over the parties in any such action or proceeding may be

parties by registered or certified mail to or by personal service at the last

12.14 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer do not intend by any provision of this
Agreement to confer any right, remedy or benefit upon any third party, and no
third party shall be entitled to enforce or otherwise shall acquire any right,
remedy or benefit by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

12.15 No Recordation. In no event shall this Agreement or any document or
memorandum related to the subject matter of this Agreement be recorded without
the prior written consent of Seller.

12.16 Effectiveness of Agreement. In no event shall any draft of this
Agreement create any obligations or liabilities, it being intended that only a
fully executed and delivered copy of this Agreement will bind the parties
hereto.

12.17 No Joint Venture. This Agreement does not and shall not be construed to
create a partnership, joint venture or any other relationship between the
parties hereto except the relationship of seller and buyer specifically
established hereby.

12.18 Successors and Assigns. Buyer may not assign or transfer its rights or
obligations under this Agreement (or make an offer or enter into negotiations
to do so) without the prior written consent of Seller (in which event such
transferee shall assume in writing all of the Buyer's obligations hereunder,
but Buyer shall not be released from its obligations hereunder), such consent
to be within Seller's sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, Buyer
may assign its interest in this Agreement without the consent of Seller to a
"single-purpose bankruptcy remote entity" which is "controlled by Buyer" (in
which event such transferee shall assume in writing all of the transferor's
obligations hereunder, and Buyer shall be released from its obligations
hereunder to the extent the Closing has occurred). As used herein, "controlled
by Buyer" with respect to an entity means that Buyer: (1) has the sole ability
to direct the management, policies and operation of such entity, directly or
indirectly, through voting securities or otherwise; and (2) Buyer owns more
than fifty percent (50%) of the direct or indirect ownership interests in such
entity. Any change in control or majority ownership of Buyer constitutes an
assignment for purposes of this subsection. No consent given by Seller to any
transfer or assignment of Buyer's rights or obligations hereunder shall be
construed as a consent to any other transfer or assignment of Buyer's rights
or obligations hereunder. Additionally, and notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller acknowledges that Buyer is or is an affiliate of a real estate
investment trust and, as such, may designate that a portion of the Property be
conveyed to an operating lessee, which conveyance shall not require the
consent of Seller and the parties will revise the Bill of Sale as needed to
reflect Buyer's structure, provided notice and the names of the entities
involved is provided to Seller prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period. In addition, Buyer shall not re-sell the Property or assign its rights
or obligations under this Agreement (or make an offer or enter into
negotiations to do so) through a "double escrow" or other similar mechanism
without Seller's prior written consent (which consent may be withheld in
Seller's sole and absolute discretion). No transfer or assignment in violation
of the provisions hereof shall be valid or enforceable. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the
parties.

12.19 Notices. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, all notices required
or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing. Such notices shall be
effective upon receipt or refusal of receipt following deposit into the United
States mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or if hand delivered or if sent by nationally recognized overnight
courier

(11 United States Code Sections 101 et seq.), or any successor statutes. This
Section shall survive Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

12.21 Limitation of Liability. No present or future partner, member, director,
officer, shareholder, employee, advisor, affiliate or agent of or in Seller or
Buyer or any affiliate of Seller or Buyer shall have any personal liability,

agreement made or entered into under or in connection with the provisions of
this Agreement, or any amendment or amendments to any of the foregoing made at
any time or times, heretofore or hereafter, and Seller and Buyer and their
respective successors and assigns and, without limitation, all other persons
and entities, shall look solely to Seller's and/or Buyer's assets (and with

severally), respectively, for the payment of any claim or for any performance,
and Seller and Buyer hereby waive any and all such personal liability. For

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee (buyer)
of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor (seller)
is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner
of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property
interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. To inform ____________________________ ("Transferee"),
that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real
property interest by WTCC BEAVER CREEK INVESTORS V, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is disregarded as
separate from WTCC Beaver Creek Mezz V, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
company ("Transferor") to Transferee, the undersigned hereby certifies the
following on behalf of Transferor:



1\. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue
Code and Income Tax Regulations);



2\. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Income Tax Regulations;



3\. Transferor's U. S. employer identification number is 20-8912250; and



4\. Transferor's office address is:



c/o Walton Street Capital, L.L.C.

Attn: Mr. Douglas Welker, Mr. Justin Leonard and Angela Lang, Esq.



Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.



Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
Transferor.



Executed as of the ____ day of __________, 2017, at Chicago, Illinois.

POST-CLOSING ESCROW AGREEMENT

______, 2017

Chicago Title Insurance Company

__________________

Re:

Park Hyatt Beaver Creek

Your Escrow No. _____________________ 

| 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Please refer to that certain agreement captioned "SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT"
(as amended from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of March 9,
2017, by and between WTCC BEAVER CREEK INVESTORS V, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company ("Seller"), and ____________________ ("Buyer"). Except as
otherwise indicated, each capitalized term used herein shall have the meaning
set forth for the same in the Purchase Agreement.

This agreement (this "Agreement") will constitute your instructions with
respect to the escrow (the "Escrow") of Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars ($3,750,000.00) (together with any
interest accrued thereon, the "Holdback Funds") being delivered to you
concurrently herewith pursuant to Section 8.3.2 of the Purchase Agreement as
security for any loss or damage incurred by Buyer as a result of the breach by
Seller of any covenant, indemnity, representation or warranty of Seller under
the Purchase Agreement (collectively, "Buyer Damages") in connection with any
Claim (as defined in Section 1.3.1 below) made by Buyer during the Survival
Period.

I. ESCROW

1.1 Background. Section 8.3 of the Purchase Agreement requires that the Escrow
be established by Buyer and Seller at Closing with a portion of Seller's
proceeds from the Purchase Price equal to the Holdback Funds. The Holdback
Funds are to be held to provide for timely payment of certain post-closing
claims made by Buyer against Seller in connection with a breach of Seller's
covenants, indemnities, representations and warranties of Seller under the
Purchase Agreement (such obligations being herein called the "Subject
Obligations").

1.2 Delivery of Funds to be Escrowed. You have been instructed to deposit at
Closing a portion of Seller's proceeds from the Purchase Price equal to the
Holdback Funds into a separate account in order to fund the Escrow. The
balance of such Holdback Funds held by you from time to time is herein called
the "Escrow Balance." No disbursement of the Escrow Balance shall be made to
Buyer or Seller or any other person except in accordance with this Agreement.



3721766.8 EXHIBIT R

* * *





1.3 Disbursements of the Holdback Funds.

1.3.1 In the event that Buyer determines, during the Survival Period, that it
has incurred Buyer Damages for an aggregate amount in excess of One Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) (the "Deductible"), then Buyer shall
notify Seller and Escrow Agent in writing of such allegation, including
reasonable supporting documentation evidencing such Buyer Damages (a "Claim
Notice") and the alleged amount of Buyer Damages associated with such Claim
Notice (the "Claim"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Deductible shall not be applicable to any Claims under Section 6.4 of the
Agreement or insured claims against Seller or Manager for matters accruing and
arising prior to the Closing Date.

1.3.2 Within five (5) business days after receipt of a Claim Notice, Seller
shall either: (i) agree in writing to permit the disbursement of the amount of
such alleged Buyer Damages by Escrow Agent; or (ii) inform Escrow Agent and
Buyer in writing that Seller does not agree to permit such disbursement. If
Seller fails to respond during the foregoing five (5) business day period, the
same shall be deemed to be the response of Seller under clause (i) of the
previous sentence. If Seller agrees in writing to permit the requested
distribution to Buyer pursuant to clause (i) or fails to timely respond, then
Escrow Agent shall promptly make the disbursement as requested by Buyer and
approved or deemed to be approved by Seller. If Seller acts under clause (ii),
then Escrow Agent shall thereafter:

(a) act solely in accordance with any of the following:

(i) a joint written agreement of Seller and Buyer regarding the disbursement
or non-disbursement of Holdback Funds incident to the Claim Notice at issue;
or

(ii) a judgment that is final beyond appeals of a court of competent
jurisdiction (as provided in the Purchase Agreement); or

(b) upon not less than ten (10) business days' written notice to Buyer and
Seller, deposit the Escrow Balance with a court of competent jurisdiction and
commence an action for interpleader therein for determination of the amount of
the Buyer Damages and distribution of the Escrow Balance. Seller acknowledges
and agrees that, should Buyer make a claim for Buyer Damages within the
Survival Period, and, if Seller objects to or seeks to prevent the
interpleading of the alleged amount of Buyer Damages, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, or the Purchase Agreement, (i)
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold that portion of the Holdback Funds equal
to the alleged Buyer Damages until the parties agree to its disposition or
until the amount is interplead, and (ii) Seller shall continue to remain in
existence until such interpleader action has been concluded, including any and
all available appeals in connection with the litigation between the parties or
the interpleader action.



3721766.8 EXHIBIT R

* * *





The final determination of the court, including any and all available appeals,
in connection with the litigation between the parties or the interpleader
action shall be conclusive as to both the amount of Buyer Damages and the
related Claim.

1.3.3 On the first business day after the Survival Period (the "Release
Date"), you are hereby authorized and directed to transfer to Seller, in
accordance with the wiring instructions set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto
and made a part hereof, the Release Amount. As used herein, the "Release
Amount" means the Escrow Balance minus the amount of any Claims made by Buyer
pursuant to one or more Claims Notices prior to the Release Date.

1.3.4 Any amount retained by Escrow Agent pursuant to Sections 1.3.1 or 1.3.2
following the Survival Period shall be held and disbursed to Seller (in
accordance with Exhibit A) after final and conclusive resolution of all Claims
or to Buyer (in accordance with wire instructions to be provided to you by
Buyer), as each such Claim is finally and conclusively resolved. You shall
make such disbursements to Buyer and/or to Seller, as the case may be, upon
(i) presentation of a judgment that is final beyond appeals of a court of
competent jurisdiction respecting such Claim, five (5) business days after you
send notice to the other party of such requested disbursement, or,
alternatively, (ii) the receipt of written instructions jointly signed by
Seller and Buyer.

1.4 Interest. Seller and Buyer hereby instruct and authorize you to invest the
Holdback Funds in any of the following: (i) United States Treasury
obligations; (ii) United States Treasury-backed repurchase agreements issued
by a major national money center banking institution reasonably acceptable to
Seller and Buyer; or (iii) such other investments as may be reasonably
acceptable to Seller and Buyer.

1.5 Legal Costs. In the event any action be instituted by a party to enforce
this Agreement, or in the event of any litigation, claim or action whatsoever
concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such
action (as determined by the court, agency or other authority before which
such suit or proceeding is commenced), shall be entitled to such reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and expenses as may be fixed by the decision maker. The
foregoing includes, but is not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, any
poundage fees or other fees imposed by the court, expenses and costs of
investigation incurred in (1) appellate proceedings; (2) in any post-judgment
proceedings to collect or enforce the judgment; (3) establishing the right to
indemnification; and (4) any action or participation in, or in connection
with, any case or proceeding under Chapter 7, 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code
(11 United States Code Sections 101 et seq.), or any successor statutes. This
provision is separate and several and shall survive the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the earlier termination of this
Agreement.



3721766.8 EXHIBIT R

* * *





1.6 Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the date on which the
Holdback Funds shall have been fully disbursed by you in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

II. MISCELLANEOUS

2.1 Notices. Any notice which a party is required or may desire to give the
other party shall be in writing and may be delivered (1) personally, (2) by
United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, (3) by Federal
Express or other reputable courier service regularly providing evidence of
delivery (with charges paid by the party sending the notice); or (4) by

in connection with the conveyance of the Property by Seller to Purchaser.

The "Declaration Documents" (as referenced in Schedule A attached hereto) are

execution and no other agreements or understandings exist between Seller and
any other party to the Declaration Documents except as provided in Schedule A
attached hereto. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the
meaning assigned thereto in the Declaration Documents.

As of the date of this letter (this "Estoppel") and except as provided in
Schedule B, to the knowledge of the undersigned, Seller is not in default with
respect to any payment obligation or duty under the Declaration Documents, and
no events have occurred that, with the giving of notice or

passage of time or both, would constitute a default by Seller thereunder. To
the knowledge of the undersigned, Seller\'s current use and operation of the
Property as a hotel complies with any and all use covenants and operating
requirements contained in the Declaration Documents.

As of the date of this Estoppel and except as provided in Schedule B, all
monetary obligations of Seller under the Declaration Documents to date have
been fully and currently paid and no advance assessments have been paid, and
there has not been any special assessment declared under the Declaration
Documents.

The undersigned hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts provide
any mortgagee of Purchaser (any "Lender") with copies of all notices of
default with respect to any obligation or duty of the Purchaser under the
Declaration Documents in the manner and to the extent required under the
Declaration Documents and a reasonable time period to cure the same consistent
with the terms of the Declaration and the Association\'s policies. All such
notices to Lender shall be sent in accordance with the terms of the
Declaration Documents to the following address (or such other address
designated by Lender):

_______________________ 
_______________________

Attention: _______________ 
Facsimile: _______________

To the knowledge of the undersigned, no claim, dispute or controversy
presently exists between Seller and the undersigned including any litigation
or arbitration concerning the Property, the Declaration Documents, or the
performance of the terms thereof or any other matter except as provided in
Schedule B.

The undersigned has no right or option to purchase all or any part of the
Property, except as provided in the Declaration Documents and applicable law
in connection with a foreclosure of the lien of the undersigned for
assessments.

The person executing this Estoppel has the power and authority to execute and
deliver this Estoppel on behalf of the undersigned.

The undersigned certifies that Purchaser and any Lender and their respective
affiliates, successors, assigns and/or participants, may rely on the
representations contained herein in connection with the acquisition of the
Property and any loan secured thereby.
