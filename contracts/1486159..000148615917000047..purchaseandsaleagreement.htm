"incurred", as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with
GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society ("COPAS") standards, as
applied by Seller in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, subject to the last sentence of Section 1.4(c). For purposes of
allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under
this Section 1.4(b), (A) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the
pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are
transported from the lands covered by the applicable Lease, Unit or Well, or
if there are no storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meter or
similar meter at the entry point into the pipelines through which they are
transported from such lands and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be
"from or attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through
the delivery point sales meters, custody transfer meters or other gas flow or
volume meters at the entry point into the pipelines through which they are
transported from such lands. Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative
procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
(including gas production meters or sales meters) or gauging and strapping
data is not available.

(c) As used herein, "Property Costs" means, determined without duplication,
(i) all costs paid or payable to Third Parties attributable to the ownership
or operation of the Assets, including prepaid costs or deposits and costs of
insurance, (ii) capital expenditures paid or payable to Third Parties incurred
in the ownership or operation of the Assets, (iii) with respect to Assets that
are not Seller-Operated Assets, any overhead costs charged to the Assets by
Third Party operators under the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement,
pooling agreement, pre-pooling agreement, pooling order or similar instrument
by unaffiliated Third Parties, or if none, charged to the Assets on the same
basis as charged on the Execution Date and (iv) in addition to the foregoing
items, with respect to Seller-Operated Assets, an aggregate Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000.00) per month (prorated for any partial months as
applicable); provided that "Property Costs" shall exclude, without limitation,
liabilities, Damages, losses, costs, and expenses to the extent attributable
to (A) claims, investigations, Proceedings or litigation to the extent
directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from actual or claimed
personal injury or death, property damage or violation of 

any Law (including private torts or non-contractual common law causes of
action), (B) title claims (including claims that the Leases have terminated),
(C) obligations to plug wells, dismantle facilities, close pits and restore
the surface or seabed around such wells, facilities and pits, excluding costs
incurred by Seller in the ordinary course of the performance of any such
obligations prior to Closing, (D) obligations to cure, address or remediate
any contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil or Equipment that is
required under applicable Environmental Laws, (E) obligations to furnish make-
up gas according to the terms of applicable gas sales, gathering or
transportation contracts, (F) gas balancing obligations and similar
obligations arising from Imbalances, (G) claims for improper calculation or
payment of royalties, overriding royalties or similar burdens based on the
deduction of post-production costs or the use of prices received by Seller or
a particular reference price, (H) obligations to pay working interests,
royalties, overriding royalties or other interests held in suspense, (I) lease
acquisition costs (including bonus and purchase price) of Contract Acreage,
(J) Retained Seller Obligations and (K) Income Taxes, Property Taxes and
Transfer Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for Property Costs attributable to
the period before the Effective Time, subject to the survival period for
Seller's Retained Obligations with respect to Property Costs set forth in the
last sentence of Section 11.4(b). For the purposes of calculating the
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2, right-of-way fees,
insurance premiums and Property Costs (excluding delay rentals, lease bonuses,
minimum royalties, option payments, lease extension payments and shut-in
royalties) that are paid periodically or otherwise cover services or
deliveries for a period shall be prorated based on the number of days in the
applicable period falling before, or at and after, the Effective Time. Subject
to the preceding sentence, determination of whether Property Costs are
attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall be based
on when services are rendered, when goods are delivered, or when the work is
performed.

Section 1.5 Delivery and Maintenance of Records.

(a) Seller, at Purchaser's cost, shall deliver the Records in Seller's
possession or control (FOB Seller's office) to Purchaser within ten (10)
Business Days following Closing. Seller may retain original Records and/or
copies of any Records.

(b) Purchaser, for a period of four (4) years following the Closing, will (i)
retain the Records, (ii) provide Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their
officers, employees and representatives with reasonable access to the Records
during normal business hours for review and copying at Seller's expense and
(iii) within five (5) days of receipt of written notice from Seller, provide
Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees, consultants and
legal counsel with access, during normal business hours, to the Records
relating to any claim for indemnification made under Section 11.2 (excluding,
however, (A) attorney work product and communications protected by attorney-
client privilege and prepared with respect to any such claim being brought by
Purchaser and (B) information subject to an applicable confidentiality
restriction in favor of Third Parties) for review and copying at Seller's
expense. 

ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase
Price") shall consist of (a) Four Hundred Eighty-Three Million Four Hundred
Two Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-One Dollars ($483,402,451.00) in cash (the
"Cash Consideration") and (a) Forty-Six Million (46,000,000) shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). The Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as provided in Section 2.2 and Section 9.4 (as adjusted, the
"Adjusted Purchase Price").

Section 2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Cash Consideration for the
Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all such amounts (other than any
Property Taxes, which shall be determined in accordance with Section 7.8(a))
being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, as applied by
Seller in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (with
such adjustments being made so as to not give duplicative effect):

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received and
retained by Seller: (i) proceeds earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of
any royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of
production, gathering, processing and transportation costs paid by Seller and
not reimbursed to Seller by the purchaser of production) produced from or
attributable to the Properties on or after the Effective Time and (ii) other
proceeds earned with respect to the Assets on or after the Effective Time that
belong to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.4(b);

(b) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.5 or Section 7.7, by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of those Properties (i) with respect to which
preferential purchase rights have been exercised prior to Closing, or (ii)
that are affected by unsatisfied and unwaived Consent Requirements or
University Lands Consent;

(c) Reduced in accordance with Section 7.7 by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of those Properties that are subject to a Proceeding prior to the
Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
preferential rights;

(d) (i) Subject to Section 3.4(i), and without duplication of any Title Defect
Amounts taken into account under Section 2.2(l), reduced by the applicable
Title Defect Amount as a result of Title Defects for which the Title Defect
Amount has been finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section 3.4 and by
the Allocated Value (or applicable portion thereof) of any Title Defect
Property retained by Seller pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(i)(B), offset by the
applicable Title Benefit Amount as a result of Title Benefits for which the
Title Benefit Amount has been finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section
3.4 and (ii) subject to Section 3.4(c) and Section 3.4(h), reduced by the
Defect Escrow Amount;

(e) Reduced by the Allocated Values (or the applicable portion thereof) of any
Properties excluded by Seller pursuant to Section 3.6; 

(f) Reduced by the Allocated Values (or the applicable portion thereof) of any
Properties excluded by Seller pursuant to Section 4.1;

(g) Subject to Section 4.4, and without duplication of any Environmental
Defect Amounts taken into account under Section 2.2(l), reduced by (i) the
applicable Environmental Defect Amount as a result of Environmental Defects
for which Section 4.4(a)(i) applies and the Environmental Defect Amount has
been finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section 4.4, and (ii) the
Allocated Value of any Property retained by Seller pursuant to Section
4.4(a)(ii);

(h) Increased by the amount equal to the value of all of Seller's inventories
of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties that are in
storage in tanks or pipelines above the load line or above the pipeline
connection, as applicable, as of the Effective Time (which value shall be
computed using the applicable contract price), less any overriding royalties,
royalties and similar burdens on or payable out of production (other than any
Income Taxes, Property Taxes and Transfer Taxes); provided, however, that the
adjustment contemplated by this paragraph shall be only made to the extent
that Seller does not receive and retain the proceeds, or portion thereof,
attributable to the sale of such Hydrocarbons;

(i) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs (other than
any Income Taxes, Property Taxes and Transfer Taxes) attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assets and incurred on or after the Effective
Time that are paid by Seller, including pre-paid costs and deposits, except
any Property Costs and other such costs already deducted in the determination
of proceeds in Section 2.2(a);

(j) Increased by an amount equal to the value, as determined according to the
COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures, of all surplus tubular, goods and physical
inventory (including water) to the extent such items are owned by Seller and
included in the Assets at the Effective Time;

(k) Decreased in accordance with Section 7.10, as applicable;

(l) With respect to all Contract Acreage acquired by Seller during the period
that commences on the Execution Date and ends on the Final Settlement Date
(the "Contract Acreage Deadline") and which purports to conform to the lands
and depths set forth on Schedule 2.2(l) for such acquired Contract Acreage,
increased by an amount equal to the sum of the "Allocated Values" of such
Contract Acreage as set forth on Schedule 2.2(l) (but only insofar as so
acquired by Seller), and in each case subject to the adjustments and terms of
Section 2.5;

(m) Increased by the amount of all Property Taxes allocated to Purchaser in
accordance with Section 7.8(a) but paid or otherwise economically borne by
Seller (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Property Taxes that were
withheld or deducted from the gross amount paid or payable to Seller in
connection with a transaction to which Section 2.2(a) applies, and therefore
were taken into account in determining the "proceeds 

received" by Seller for purposes of applying Section 2.2(a) with respect to
such transaction); and

(n) Reduced by the amount of all Property Taxes allocated to Seller in
accordance with Section 7.8(a) but paid or otherwise economically borne by
Purchaser.

The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the
amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties on or after the
Effective Time, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets on or after the Effective Time, and
Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or
income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has
been made. For purposes of the determination of the Purchase Price or the
Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable, each share of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock shall be valued at the Share Price (other than for purposes of Section
2.3(b)).

Section 2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Purchaser and Seller have allocated the unadjusted Purchase Price among
each of the Assets as set forth in Schedule 2.3(a) as adjusted to reflect
adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.2. The value
allocated to an Asset in Schedule 2.3(a) is herein referred to as its
"Allocated Value." The Parties have accepted such Allocated Values solely for
purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but
Seller makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

(b) Purchaser and Seller agree that the Purchase Price and any other items
properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall
be allocated among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the United States Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, as set forth on Exhibit F (the "1060
Allocation"). Purchaser and Seller shall update the 1060 Allocation in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and Purchaser and Seller shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with the 1060 Allocation,
as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594,
and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position on any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with the 1060 Allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be
unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise
and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with
such allocation.

Section 2.4 Deposit. On or before the first Business Day that follows the
Execution Date, Purchaser, Seller and Deposit Escrow Agent have entered into
the Deposit Escrow Agreement and Purchaser has paid to the Deposit Escrow
Agent an earnest money deposit in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Deposit") in cash. The Deposit shall be held in an escrow
account that will be administered in accordance with the Deposit Escrow
Agreement. In the event the Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be applied
against the Cash Consideration. The Parties 

agree to provide joint written instructions to the Deposit Escrow Agent to
distribute or apply the Deposit, as applicable, as and when provided in this
Agreement. In the event that Purchaser has not paid the Deposit to the Deposit
Escrow Agent on or before the date that is the third Business Day that follows
the Execution Date, Seller shall have the right, at its option, to terminate
this Agreement in its entirety, and if such option is exercised, then the
provisions of Section 10.2 shall apply.

Section 2.5 Contract Acreage.

(a) If Seller acquires Contract Acreage prior to the date that is thirty (30)
calendar days before Closing (the "Closing Acreage Deadline") and delivers a
written notice to Purchaser of such acquisition by such date (a "Contract
Acreage Notice"), then such Contract Acreage shall be deemed to constitute a
Lease or Leases and shall be included in the Assets to be assigned in the
Conveyance at Closing, except as provided in in Section 2.5(c) and Section
2.5(d). Each Contract Acreage Notice shall include all ownership reports, run-
sheets and other title and acquisition documentation in Seller's possession
relating to each tract of Contract Acreage.

(b) If Seller acquires Contract Acreage after the Closing Acreage Deadline but
on or prior to the Contract Acreage Deadline and delivers a Contract Acreage
Notice by such date, then such Contract Acreage shall (i) be deemed to
constitute a Lease or Leases and shall be included in the Assets, but (ii) not
be delivered through the Conveyance at Closing, but shall be assigned, sold
and purchased after Closing as provided in Section 2.5(d).

(c) Upon receipt of any Contract Acreage Notice, Purchaser may assert Title
Defects and Environmental Defects affecting the Contract Acreage subject to
the Contract Acreage Notice in the same manner as provided under Article 3 and
Article 4 for other Properties, mutatis mutandis, subject to the remainder of
this Section 2.5(c). If the Contract Acreage is to be assigned at Closing
pursuant to Section 2.5(a), then there shall be no change to the Title Claim
Date and Environmental Claim Date with respect to such Contract Acreage, and
the provisions of Article 3 and Article 4 shall apply in accordance with their
terms with respect to the resolution of any Title Defects and Environmental
Defects. If any Contract Acreage is to be assigned after Closing pursuant to
Section 2.5(b) ("Post-Closing Contract Acreage"), then the Title Claim Date
and Environmental Claim Date for such Post-Closing Contract Acreage shall be
deemed to be the date that is the first Business Day following the date that
is thirty (30) calendar days after Purchaser receives the applicable Contract
Acreage Notice. With respect to Title Defects and Environmental Defects that
may be asserted by Purchaser affecting Post-Closing Contract Acreage, the
Parties shall have the same rights as are provided for Properties assigned at
Closing to make elections under Section 3.4(d) or Section 4.4 (as applicable)
and/or for Seller to make an election to attempt to cure under Section 3.4(c)
(it being understood the Cure Period in such instance shall be ninety (90)
days from the date the claim for the applicable Title Defect is received);
provided that any such elections under any of the foregoing Sections shall be
asserted in writing on or before the date that is ten (10) days after the
Title Claim Date and/or Environmental Claim Date for such Post-Closing
Contract Acreage. All disputes regarding asserted Title Defects or 

Environmental Defects affecting Post-Closing Contract Acreage shall be
submitted for resolution to a Title Arbitrator and/or Environmental
Arbitrator, and the procedures of Section 3.4(h) and Section 4.4(b), as
applicable, shall apply mutatis mutandis as for other Properties to be
assigned at Closing.

(d) With respect to Contract Acreage that is not assigned at Closing, all such
Contract Acreage shall be assigned to Purchaser using a form of assignment
substantially similar to the Conveyance (provided the effective time of the
Assignment shall be the date such Contract Acreage was effectively acquired by
Seller) on the date that is the later of (i) the Final Settlement Date and
(ii) the settlement date provided in Section 9.4(c) in the event there are
unresolved matters as of the Final Settlement Date affecting such Contract
Acreage as contemplated in Section 9.4(c), subject in either case to any
contrary elections by the Parties, as applicable, for Seller to retain
Contract Acreage under Article 3 or Article 4\. If possible for any Contract
Acreage, all adjustments under Section 2.2(l), adjustments for Title Defects
or Environmental Defects, and other adjustments under Section 2.2 that are
applicable to such Contract Acreage shall be set forth in the Final Settlement
Statement; if not possible, the terms of Section 9.4(b) and Section 9.4(c)
applicable to such Contract Acreage shall apply with respect to such
adjustments and the settlement thereof.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
shall have no obligation to acquire particular Contract Acreage (and there
shall be no corresponding adjustment under Section 2.2(l)) to the extent such
Contract Acreage is subject to an unsatisfied Consent Requirement, or a
preferential right to purchase that is triggered by the assignment of such
Contract Acreage and has either been exercised or the time for its exercise
has not expired and it has not been waived. To the extent Contract Acreage is
subject to a consent requirement that is not a Consent Requirement, then
Purchaser shall be responsible after assignment to satisfy such consent at its
sole cost, risk and expense. Any University Lands Consents affecting Contract
Acreage shall be exclusively resolved as provided in Section 3.5(c) to the
extent the terms thereof are applicable. Seller shall be responsible for any
and all bonuses, brokers' fees and other acquisition costs to the extent
related to its acquisition of any Contract Acreage.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Purchaser be required to acquire more than the Net Mineral Acres set
forth on Schedule 2.2(l) for the applicable Contract Acreage pursuant to this
Agreement unless Purchaser consents to such acquisition in writing prior to
Closing, which consent may be withheld at Purchaser's sole discretion.

ARTICLE 3

TITLE MATTERS

Section 3.1 Seller's Title.

(a) Without limiting the express provisions of this Agreement, this Article 3
and the Special Warranty set forth in the Conveyance (subject to Section 7.9)
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be the exclusive
right and remedy of Purchaser with 

respect to title to the Assets. For purposes of this Article 3, any Contract
Acreage shall be deemed a "Lease" or "Leases" subject to this Article 3, the
number of Net Mineral Acres attributable to Contract Acreage for purposes of
Defensible Title (and any Title Benefit) shall be as set forth in the
applicable Contract Acreage Notice and the "Allocated Value" shall be equal to
the adjustment made on account of such Contract Acreage under Section 2.2(l)
(without taking into account any reductions for Title Defects or Environmental
Defects), subject in all respects to Section 2.5.

(b) The assignment, bill of sale and conveyance of the Assets to be delivered
by Seller to Purchaser shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the
"Conveyance").

Section 3.2 Certain Definitions.

Seller that is deducible of record, which as of the Effective Time and the
Closing Date, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances:

(i) entitles Seller to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed from any Lease, Unit or Well throughout the productive life thereof
(after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating
royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by
production of Hydrocarbons) (a "Net Revenue Interest") as to the Target
Formation, of not less than the "net revenue interest" share shown in Exhibit
A or Exhibit A-1 for such Lease, Unit or Well as to the Target Formation,
except for (1) decreases resulting from reversionary interests, carried
interests, horizontal or vertical severances or other matters or changes in
interest, in each case, to the extent stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, (2)
decreases in connection with those operations permitted under Section 7.5 in
which Seller may after the Execution Date be a non-consenting party, (3)
decreases resulting from the election to ratify or the establishment or
amendment of pools or units on or after the Execution Date or changes in tract
or production allocations, in each case to the extent permitted by Section
7.5, (4) decreases resulting from subsequent reversions after the Execution
Date of interests to co-owners resulting from third party co-owner elections
not to consent to an operation to the extent reflected in the after payout Net
Revenue Interests reflected on Exhibit A-1, and (5) decreases required to
allow other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or
pipelines to make up past under deliveries;

(ii) obligates Seller to bear not greater than the "working interest" share
shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, any Lease, Unit or
Well (a "Working Interest") as to the Target Formation, except for (1)
increases resulting from matters stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, (2)
increases resulting from the carrying of the cost of non-participating owners
or cotenants in Leases, Wells or Lands with respect to operations to the
extent reflected in the Working Interests reflected on Exhibit A-1 for
elections made by such owners or cotenants prior to the Execution Date, (3)
increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting
or non- 

participating parties under applicable operating, unit, pooling, pre-pooling
or similar agreements and (4) increases that are accompanied by at least a
proportionate increase in Seller's Net Revenue Interest;

(iii) is free and clear of liens and encumbrances that affect or encumber
title to a Property;

(iv) with respect to the Target Formation, entitles Seller to the number of
Net Mineral Acres attributable to a Lease set forth in Exhibit A; or

(v) is in its entirety either (A) held by production in paying quantities or
(B) is subject to a primary paid-up Lease term or term under a term assignment
that does not expire prior to the expiration date for such Lease set forth on
Exhibit A.

As used herein, a "Subject Property" means a Lease, Unit or Well to the extent
it relates to Defensible Title.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" shall mean any right,
circumstance or condition that (i) with respect to the Target Formation,
operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest of Seller in any Subject
Property above that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, without causing a
greater than proportionate increase in Seller's Working Interest above that
shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 or (ii) with respect to the Target
Formation, operates to increase the Net Mineral Acres covered by a Lease owned
by Seller above that shown in Exhibit A, other than, in each case, increases
resulting from elections or defaults from elections or defaults by non-
participating or defaulting owners or cotenants.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Defect" shall mean any lien,
encumbrance, obligation or defect that causes Seller's title to any Subject
Property shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 to be less than Defensible Title;
provided that "Title Defect" shall exclude the following:

(i) defects based solely on a lack of information in Seller's files or
references to a document if such document is not in Seller's files;

(ii) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization
unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that the action was not
authorized and could reasonably be expected to result in another Person's
superior claim of title to the relevant Subject Property;

(iii) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite
marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate
Proceedings, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such failure
or omission could reasonably be expected to result in another Person's
superior claim of title to the relevant Subject Property;

(iv) defects based on a gap in Seller's chain of title unless such gap is
affirmatively shown to exist after a review of the available public and/or
county or 

parish records and the Records, by an abstract of title, title opinion or
landman's title chain (which documents shall be included in any Title Defect
Notice);

(v) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or
prescription;

(vi) defects arising out of a lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly
required by applicable Laws;

(vii) defects asserting that non-consent, carried or before and after-payout
interests reflected on Exhibit A-1 do not transfer record leasehold title or
have not been recorded in the county records, to the extent such interests
have been earned by Seller in accordance with the terms of the applicable
joint operating agreement;

(viii) defects based on the failure of Seller to hold record title to (or to
have received an assignment of) any Property if such Property is subject to a
binding purchase and sale agreement or similar acquisition agreement and
Seller reasonably expects the closing of the acquisition and assignment of
such Property to Seller to occur in the ordinary course of business; provided
that all obligations of Seller required for such closing and assignment have
either been performed or are ministerial or administrative in nature; and

(ix) defects disclosed on Schedule 3.2(c)(ix).

(d) As used herein, the term "Net Mineral Acres" means, as calculated
separately with respect to each Lease, (i) the number of gross acres in the
land, covered by such Lease, multiplied by (ii) the lessor's undivided
percentage mineral interest in such lands, multiplied by (iii) Seller's
working interest in such Lease. In the event the interest of Seller varies by
tract or depth, there shall be a separate calculation made on a tract-by-tract
or depth basis to determine the total Net Mineral Acres covered by a Lease.

Section 3.3 Definition of Permitted Encumbrances. As used herein, the term
"Permitted Encumbrances" means any or all of the following:

(a) royalties, nonparticipating royalty interests, net profits interests and
any overriding royalties, reversionary interests and other burdens to the
extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, (i) reduce Seller's
Net Revenue Interest below that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 or increase
Seller's Working Interest above that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 without
a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest, in each case as to the
Target Formation, or (ii) reduce the number of Net Mineral Acres covered by a
Lease below the amount set forth in Exhibit A as to the Target Formation;

all applicable Laws, rules and orders of any such Governmental Body or under
any Governmental Authorization, franchise, grant, license or permit issued by
any such Governmental Body; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, this
provision does not refer to rights of a Governmental Body in its role as
mineral owner or lessor;

(l) any encumbrance on or affecting the Assets which is discharged by Seller
at or prior to Closing;

(m) any prior oil and gas lease, or lien or encumbrance, that has not been
made subject to a recorded release or surrender, but for which the terms of
such instrument provide that such instrument has expired or terminated, unless
Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such instrument is still in
effect and could reasonably be expected to provide another Person superior
title;

(n) any matters expressly set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1;

(o) any maintenance of uniform interest provision in an operating agreement or
similar agreement if waived by the parties having the right to enforce such
provision or if the violation of such provision would not unwind or void the
sale of the affected Asset hereunder and would not, individually or in the
aggregate: (i) reduce Seller's Net Revenue Interest below that shown in
Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 or increase Seller's Working Interest above that
shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 without a corresponding increase in the Net
Revenue Interest, in each case as to the Target Formation, (ii) reduce the
number of Net Mineral Acres covered by a Lease below the amount set forth in
Exhibit A as to the Target Formation, or (iii) reduce the paid-up primary term
for Lease to a date earlier than the expiration date for such Lease set forth
on Exhibit A;

(p) Imbalances associated with the Assets; and

(q) any liens, charges, encumbrances, defects or irregularities in the
ordinary course of business consisting of minor defects and irregularities in
title or of record or other restrictions (whether created by or arising out of
joint operating agreements, farm-out agreements, leases and assignments,
contracts for purchases of Hydrocarbons or similar Contracts or Surface
Rights, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business), in each case, that
do not result in another party's competing claim of title and that are of a
nature customarily accepted by prudent purchasers of oil and gas properties
and do not, individually or in the aggregate, (i) reduce Seller's Net Revenue
Interest below that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 or increase Seller's
Working Interest above that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 without a
corresponding increase in Net Revenue Interest, in each case as to the Target 

Formation, (ii) reduce the number of Net Mineral Acres covered by a Lease
below the amount set forth in Exhibit A as to the Target Formation, (iii)
reduce the paid-up primary term for Lease to a date earlier than the
expiration date for such Lease set forth on Exhibit A or (iv) materially
interfere with the ownership and operation of the Assets subject thereto or
affected thereby as currently owned and operated or with respect to reasonable
future development.

Section 3.4 Notice of Title Defects Defect Adjustments.

(a) Title Defects. To assert a Title Defect (other than a special warranty
claim pursuant to the Conveyance), Purchaser must deliver claim notices to
Seller (each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before the day that is seven (7)
Business Days before the Scheduled Closing Date (the "Title Claim Date"),
except as otherwise provided under Sections 3.5 or 3.6. Each Title Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (ii) the Subject Property (or portion thereof) affected by
the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Values
of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary
for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s) and (v)
Purchaser's reasonable estimate of the Title Defect Amount and the
computations upon which Purchaser's estimate is based. Purchaser shall be
deemed to have waived for all purposes under this Article 3 all Title Defects
that were not included in a Title Defect Notice delivered to Seller on or
before the Title Claim Date. The failure of a Title Defect Notice to contain
the items in Sections 3.4(a)(i) through (v) shall not render such notice void
and ineffective if it materially complies with the provisions hereof.

(b) Title Benefits. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
deliver to Purchaser with respect to each Title Benefit a written notice (a
"Title Benefit Notice") asserting such Title Benefit on or before the Title
Claim Date. Each Title Benefit Notice shall include (i) a description of the
Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Subject Property affected by the Title Benefit
(each a "Title Benefit Property"), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Title
Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser
to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s) and (v) Seller's
estimate of the Title Benefit Amount, and the computations upon which Seller's
estimate is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived for all purposes
hereunder all Title Benefits that were not included in a Title Benefit Notice
delivered to Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date. The failure of a
Title Benefit Notice to contain the items in Sections 3.4(b)(i) through (v)
shall not render such notice void and ineffective if it materially complies
with the provisions hereof.

(c) Cure Right. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon
delivering written notice to Purchaser, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure
or remove any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Purchaser in a
valid Title Defect Notice on or before the expiration of ninety (90) days
counted from and after the Title Claim Date (the "Cure Period"), unless the
Parties otherwise agree. At Closing, (i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Title Defect Amounts and the Environmental Defect Amounts asserted by
Purchaser and (ii) the portion of such Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects Seller has elected to cure or disputed and the portion of such
Environmental Defect Amounts attributable to Environmental Defects Seller has
disputed, in each case by providing notice 

to Purchaser at least two (2) days prior to Closing, shall be deposited by
Purchaser in an escrow account with the Defect Escrow Agent at Closing (the
"Defect Escrow Amount"). If at the end of the Cure Period (i) the Title Defect
is not cured as agreed by Seller and Purchaser or (ii) if Seller and Purchaser
cannot agree, and it is determined by the Title Arbitrator that such Title
Defect is not cured at the end of the Cure Period, then in either case Seller
shall elect one of the options set forth in Section 3.4(d)(i) for such Title
Defect, if applicable, in which event the Purchase Price adjustment required
in connection with the selected option under this Article 3 shall be made in
the Final Settlement Statement and without duplication of the foregoing, the
applicable portion of the Defect Escrow Amount will be released to Purchaser.
If at the end of the Cure Period the Title Defect is cured as agreed by Seller
and Purchaser or if Seller and Purchaser cannot agree, and it is determined by
the Title Arbitrator that such Title Defect is cured as of the end of the Cure
Period, then the applicable portion of the Defect Escrow Amount will be
released to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the resolution
of any Title Defect for a Title Defect Property does not occur until after the
Final Settlement Date, then all adjustments (taking into account the release
of the Defect Escrow Amount) shall be made contemporaneous with any assignment
(if applicable) and in accordance with the applicable terms of Section 9.4(b)
and Section 9.4(c). The Parties agree to provide joint written instructions to
the Defect Escrow Agent to distribute the Defect Escrow Amount as and when
provided in this Agreement. No action of Seller in electing or attempting to
cure a Title Defect shall constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect. In addition
to the foregoing, subject to Section 3.4(i), if (A) a Title Defect is caused
by a deficiency in Seller's Net Revenue Interest below the interest stated on
Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 for such Title Defect Property and (B) an Affiliate
of Seller holds an Affiliate ORRI on such Title Defect Property, then, at
Purchaser's request, Seller shall cause its Affiliate to convey to Purchaser
all or the applicable portion of an Affiliate ORRI to the extent necessary to
cure such Title Defect.

(d) Remedies for Title Defects.

(i) In the event that any Title Defect asserted by Purchaser in accordance
with Section 3.4(a) is not waived by Purchaser or cured before the expiration
of the Cure Period, then the following remedies shall apply to such Title
Defect:

(A) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.4(f) or 3.4(h);

(B) if the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to Section 3.4(f) or 3.4(h)
equals at least fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property, Seller may elect to retain the Title Defect Property, in
which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Property; or

(C) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10. 

(ii) Unless Section 3.4(d)(i)(B) applies, each Title Defect Property will be
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing.

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. In the event that any Title Benefit asserted
by Seller in accordance with Section 3.4(b) is not waived by Seller, then:

(i) to the extent Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount as
calculated pursuant to Section 3.4(g), any final downward adjustments to the
Purchase Price as a result of Title Defects shall be offset by such Title
Benefit Amount; and

(ii) to the extent there is no agreement under Section 3.4(e)(i) on or before
the Closing Date, the disagreement between Seller and Purchaser regarding the
Title Benefit Property or the Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 3.4(h), and any determined
Title Benefit Amount shall be used only to offset any final downward
adjustments to the Purchase Price as a result of Title Defects.

(f) The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from a Title Defect shall be
determined as follows without duplication of amounts:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 (and there is a proportionate reduction in the
Working Interest for such Title Defect Property), then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual amount of the
decrease in Net Revenue Interest from that stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1
and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A
or Exhibit A-1; provided, however, that if the Title Defect does not affect
the Title Defect Property throughout its entire life, the Title Defect Amount
shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period only;
provided, further, that if the Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect
Property is less than seventy-two percent (72%) (proportionately reduced, if
applicable), then the Title Defect Amount shall be one hundred percent (100%)
of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above or (vi) below, then the
Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of the Title Defect Property, 

the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the
Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary
to make a proper evaluation;

(v) if the Title Defect represents (A) a discrepancy between (1) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (2) the Net Revenue
Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, and/or (B) an obligation,
encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title
Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by applying
subsections (ii), (iii) and (iv) to such Title Defect; provided, that there
shall be no duplication of Title Defect Amounts affecting a Title Defect
Property;

(vi) if the Title Defect represent a discrepancy between (A) the number of Net
Mineral Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the number of Net Mineral
Acres stated in Exhibit A, then the Title Defect Amount shall be calculated by
multiplying the difference in Net Mineral Acres by the price per Net Mineral
Acre for such Title Defect Property, as set out on the Allocated Value for
such Title Defect Property; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, except for
defects described in Section 3.4(f)(ii), the aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect
Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.

(g) The "Title Benefit Amount" resulting from a Title Benefit shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual amount of the increase in Net
Revenue Interest from that stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A or
Exhibit A-1; provided, however, that (i) if the Title Benefit does not affect
the applicable Title Benefit Property throughout its entire life, the Title
Benefit Amount shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustment or other remedy
for any individual Title Benefit for which the Title Benefit Amount does not
exceed an amount equal to the Individual Defect Threshold.

(h) With respect to Title Defect Notices and Title Benefit Notices provided
and received on or before the Title Claim Date, Seller and Purchaser shall
attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts on or before the Closing Date, subject to Seller's
rights under Section 3.4(d)(i)(B) and Section 3.4(d)(i)(C). If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to agree by Closing, then subject to Seller's rights
under Section 3.4(d)(i)(B) and Section 3.4(d)(i)(C), the Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section
3.4(h). Likewise, if by the end of the Cure Period, Seller and Purchaser have
been unable to agree upon whether such Title Defect has been cured, or Seller
has failed to cure any Title Defects which Seller provided notice that Seller
would attempt to cure and Seller and Purchaser have been unable to agree on
the Title 

Defect Amounts for such Title Defects, then the cure and/or Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.4(h). There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years'
experience in oil and gas titles in the State of Texas as selected by mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the end of
the Cure Period (or such other time as mutually agreed). Absent such agreement
on the selection of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected by the
Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Title
Arbitrator"). The Title Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or
outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates or have any financial interest
in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and
shall be conducted in English and in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this Section 3.4 and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to
make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested Third Parties in advising the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, as applicable,
submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any
Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case, and shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs
and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. Within five (5) Business Days after the
Title Arbitrator has made a determination, Seller at its option may,
notwithstanding such determination, elect the option set forth in Section
3.4(d)(i)(B), if applicable, with respect to any Title Defect Property subject
to such determination, which shall become an Excluded Asset hereunder (and
reassigned to Seller using a form of assignment substantially similar to the
Conveyance, mutatis mutandis, if previously assigned to Purchaser), and the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in Section 2.2 as if such Title
Defect Property were excluded at Closing. The determination of the Title
Arbitrator (and any subsequent exclusion election by Seller) shall be taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement; provided that if such
determination occurs after the Final Settlement Date, then the terms of
Section 9.4(b) and Section 9.4(c) shall apply to all adjustments and payments
pertaining to the Title Defect Property subject thereto to the extent
applicable and, in each case, the applicable portion of the Defect Escrow
Amount shall be released to the Party entitled to such amount.

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does
not exceed Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) (the "Individual Defect
Threshold"); and (B) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for Title Defects unless
the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects covered by
Section 3.4(d)(i) that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold (minus the
amount of any Title Benefit Amounts), exceeds a deductible in an amount equal
to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price (the "Title Defect
Deductible"), after which point Purchaser 

shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other available
remedies under this Article 3 with respect to all Title Defects in excess of
the Title Defect Deductible, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold. The
provisions of this Section 3.4(i) shall not apply to Title Defects relating to
consent to assignment and preferential rights to purchase which shall be
handled or treated under Section 3.5 and Section 7.7. The Allocated Value of
any Subject Property retained by Seller in accordance with Section
3.4(d)(i)(B) may not be used in meeting the Title Defect Deductible.

Section 3.5 Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase. Seller
shall promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the Execution
Date, prepare and send (i) notices to the Third Party holders (excluding,
other than University Lands Consents, Governmental Bodies, which are addressed
elsewhere in this Agreement) of any consents to assignment of any Assets
requesting applicable consents, including University Lands Consents subject to
Section 3.5(c), and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase any Asset requesting waivers of such preferential rights to
purchase, in each case that would be triggered by the purchase and sale
contemplated by this Agreement, and of which Seller has knowledge as set forth
on Schedule 5.15 (such consents and preferential rights, "Known Preferential
Rights and Consents"). The consideration payable under this Agreement for any
particular Assets for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be
the Allocated Value for such Assets (proportionately reduced if an Asset is
only partially affected). Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to
satisfy or obtain waivers of, as applicable, such Known Preferential Rights
and Consents; provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to incur any out
of pocket expense or agree to any other liability or obligation (other than an
assumption of the existing obligations set forth in the applicable instruments
governing the Assets). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Seller shall have no liability for failure to satisfy and/or obtain
waivers of, Known Preferential Rights and Consents; provided that Seller has
complied with this Section 3.5.

(a) Consents. Seller shall notify Purchaser prior to Closing of all Known
Preferential Rights and Consents that have not been waived or granted, as
applicable, or that have been exercised in the case of preferential rights to
purchase, and the Assets to which they pertain. In no event shall there be
included in the Conveyance at Closing any Asset subject to an unsatisfied
consent requirement that would be triggered by the purchase and sale of Assets
contemplated by this Agreement and provides that the transfer of such Asset
without consent will result in (i) a termination or other material impairment
of the owner's existing rights in relation to such Asset or the assignment
thereof, or (ii) the payment of liquidated damages absent the consent (such
consent requirement, a "Consent Requirement"); provided that any consent
requirement that by its terms may not be unreasonably withheld shall not be
considered a Consent Requirement, except to the extent the consent is
expressly denied in writing or any assignment of such interest without consent
would result in the termination of the owner's existing rights in relation to
such Asset or the assignment thereof. In cases where the Asset subject to a
Consent Requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Properties to
which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser
due to the unwaived Consent Requirement, Seller shall continue after Closing
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable consent so
that Seller's right, title and interest in such Contract can be transferred to
Purchaser upon the receipt of such consent. In cases where the Asset subject
to a Consent Requirement is a 

Property and the Third Party consent to the sale and transfer of such Property
is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may elect to treat
the unsatisfied Consent Requirement as a Title Defect by giving Seller notice
thereof in accordance with Section 3.4(a), except that such notice may be
given on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, the Title Defect
Amount for such Property may not be used in meeting the Title Defect
Deductible, and Seller may elect to cure such unsatisfied Consent Requirement
under Section 3.4(c), in which event the provisions of Section 3.4(c) shall
apply, provided further that the affected Asset shall be excluded from the
Assets for purposes of the Closing until the Consent Requirement is waived or
satisfied (unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser). In cases where an
Asset is subject to a Third Party consent requirement that is not a Consent
Requirement, the Asset shall be included in the Assets at the Closing (unless
excluded pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement) and Purchaser
shall be responsible after the Closing for satisfying such consent requirement
at its sole cost, risk and expense, to the extent the applicable consent was
not obtained or waived on or prior to the Closing. If an unsatisfied Consent
Requirement for which a Purchase Price adjustment is made at the Closing is
subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final determination of the
Final Settlement Statement (the "Final Settlement Date"), Seller shall receive
an additional upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in the Final Settlement
Statement equal to the amount of the previous reduction in the Purchase Price
on account of the Consent Requirement and the provisions of this Section 3.5
shall no longer apply except for the assignment made under the next sentence.
Within five (5) Business Days of the Final Settlement Date, whether by
agreement between Seller and Purchaser or the determination of an Independent
Expert under Section 9.4(b) (or both), Seller shall assign to Purchaser using
substantially the same form as the Conveyance, to the extent previously
unassigned, each Property subject to an aforementioned Consent Requirement
that was subsequently satisfied after the Closing but prior to the Final
Settlement Date and, to the extent not previously included in the adjustments
to the Purchase Price at Closing, the Parties shall account to one another
under Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 in the Final Settlement Statement in a
manner consistent with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of this Section 3.5(a)
shall not apply to any University Lands Consents.

(b) Exercised Preferential Rights to Purchase. If any preferential right to
purchase any Property that would be triggered by the purchase and sale of
Assets contemplated by this Agreement is exercised prior to the Closing, such
Property transferred to the exercising Third Party as a result of the exercise
of such preferential right shall be excluded from the Assets for all purposes
hereunder, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced under Section 2.2(b) by the
Allocated Value for such Property (proportionately reduced if the preferential
right affects only a portion of such Property). Seller shall retain the
consideration paid by the Third Party pursuant to the exercise of such
preferential right; provided, however, that an adjustment made under this
Section 3.5(b) for such Property may not be used in meeting the Individual
Defect Threshold or the Title Defect Deductible. If any preferential right to
purchase any Asset is not exercised and does not expire prior to Closing, then
the terms of Section 7.7 shall apply to such right. 

(c) University Lands Consents. From and after the Execution Date until the
Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the University
Lands Consents and University Lands Agreement to be obtained without material
conditions other than the payment of any fee, which shall be borne by Seller
and Purchaser in equal fifty percent (50%) parts pursuant to this Section
3.5(c). From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, Purchaser shall
cooperate with Seller and use all commercially reasonable efforts (without any
obligation to agree to any liability or other material accommodation) to
assist Seller in seeking to obtain the University Lands Agreement and to
satisfy or obtain waivers of the University Lands Consents, and Purchaser
shall have the right to attend all meetings between Seller and University
Lands and participate in all negotiations with Seller and University Lands
with respect to the University Lands Agreement and the University Lands
Consents, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense. The Parties will provide each
other with copies of all correspondence, communications and information
between them or any of their representatives on the one hand, and the
Governmental Body party to any University Lands Consent or the University
Lands Agreement on the other hand, with respect to any University Lands
Consents or the University Lands Agreement. If the satisfaction or waiver of a
University Lands Consent or the University Lands Agreement requires the
payment of cash consideration, Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible
for and shall pay fifty percent (50%) of such consideration in full, and no
adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price to account for the payment of
such consideration. Seller shall notify Purchaser at or prior to Closing of
all University Lands Consents that have not been waived or granted, as
applicable, and the Assets to which they pertain.

Section 3.6 Casualty or Condemnation Loss. Subject to the provisions of
Sections 8.1(e) and 8.2(e), if, after the Execution Date but prior to the
Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty
or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (such portion of
Assets, the "Casualty Assets"), and the loss as a result of such individual
casualty or taking exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), Seller
shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to the Closing either (a) to
cause the Casualty Assets to be repaired or restored prior to Closing to at
least its condition prior to the applicable casualty, at Seller's sole cost
(without an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 or
otherwise), as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after
the Closing Date), (b) unless such casualty or taking is waived by Purchaser,
to exclude the Casualty Assets from the Assets and reduce the Purchase Price
by the Allocated Values of the Casualty Assets or (c) to include the Casualty
Assets in the Assets delivered at Closing (unless excluded pursuant to the
other provisions of this Agreement) and assign to Purchaser or subrogate
Purchaser to all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to all rights of
insurance and other claims against Third Parties that arise from or by their
terms cover the applicable casualty or taking. If Seller makes an election
under (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, Seller shall retain all of the
aforementioned rights to insurance and other claims against Third Parties with
respect to the applicable casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties
otherwise agree in writing.

Section 3.7 Limitations on Applicability. THE RIGHTS OF PURCHASER UNDER
SECTION 3.4(A) SHALL TERMINATE AS OF THE TITLE CLAIM DATE AND BE OF NO FURTHER
FORCE AND EFFECT THEREAFTER, PROVIDED THERE SHALL BE NO TERMINATION OF
PURCHASER'S OR SELLER'S RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 3.4 WITH RESPECT TO ANY BONA FIDE
TITLE DEFECT PROPERLY REPORTED IN A TITLE DEFECT 

NOTICE OR BONA FIDE TITLE BENEFIT PROPERLY REPORTED IN A TITLE BENEFIT NOTICE
ON OR BEFORE THE TITLE CLAIM DATE. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 3, FOR
THE SPECIAL WARRANTY IN THE CONVEYANCE (SUBJECT TO SECTION 7.9) AND AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES, RELEASES, REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE
SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST OR
CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH
PURCHASER OR ANY PURCHASER INDEMNITEE MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE,
BASED ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER LIEN,
ENCUMBRANCE, COVENANT, OBLIGATION, OR DEFICIENCY AFFECTING TITLE TO ANY ASSET.

ARTICLE 4

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 4.1 Assessment. From and after the Execution Date and up to and
including the Environmental Claim Date (or upon the earlier termination of
this Agreement) but subject to (a) applicable Laws, (b) the limitations set
forth herein and in Section 7.1 and Section 7.6, and (c) obtaining all
required consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of any
Assets (which consents Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain but Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration therefor),
Purchaser may, at its option, cause a Phase I environmental assessment of all
or any portion of the Assets to be conducted by a reputable environmental
consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller and
Purchaser (the "Environmental Consultant") or such Environmental Consultant or
Purchaser may conduct visual inspections, record reviews, and interviews
relating to the Properties, including their condition and their compliance
with Environmental Laws (the "Assessment"). The Assessment shall be conducted
at the sole risk, cost and expense of Purchaser, and all of Purchaser's and
the Environmental Consultant's activity conducted under this Section 4.1 and
Section 7.1 shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of Section 7.6.
Purchaser's right of access shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller, entitle Purchaser to operate equipment or conduct any sampling,
boring, testing, sampling or other invasive activities ("Invasive Activities")
without the consent of Seller or any Third Party operator, as applicable,
which Seller and Third Party operator may refuse in their sole discretion. In
the event that Purchaser (A) desires to conduct a Phase I environmental
assessment on any Asset that is operated by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
but Seller fails to provide the necessary consent for Purchaser or its
representatives, including the Environmental Consultant, to access such Asset
and conduct such Assessment prior to the Environmental Claim Date or (B)
Purchaser reasonably requests to conduct Invasive Activities with respect to
an Asset and such Invasive Activities are denied such that no Invasive
Activities are allowed to be conducted with respect to such Asset, then, in
each case, by written notice to Seller on or before the Environmental Claim
Date, Purchaser may elect to exclude such Asset from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets (and such Assets shall thereafter
be Excluded Assets for all purposes under this Agreement). For clarity, a
request to conduct Invasive Activities shall not be deemed reasonable unless
there is a 

documented report by the Environmental Consultant that discloses in writing
the reasonable likelihood of subsurface contamination and recommends the
specific or approximately same Invasive Activity as requested. Seller has the
right to be present during the Assessment. Purchaser shall coordinate its
Assessment with Seller to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the
conduct of business by Seller. Purchaser, the Environmental Consultant, and
their respective agents, employees and representatives shall abide by
Seller's, and any Third Party operator's, safety rules, regulations and
operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets
including the Assessment. Upon Seller's request, Purchaser agrees to promptly
provide, but not later than the Environmental Claim Date, copies of all final
Phase I environmental assessment reports (or final reports prepared based on
its visual inspections, record reviews and interviews) prepared or compiled by
the Environmental Consultant in connection with the Assessment. Seller shall
not be deemed by its receipt of said reports or otherwise to have made any
representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the
condition of the Assets or the accuracy of said documents or the information
contained therein. During all periods that Purchaser, the Environmental
Consultant, or any of their respective agents, employees or representatives
are on the Assets, Purchaser shall maintain, at its sole expense and with
reputable insurers, such insurance as is reasonably sufficient to support
Purchaser's indemnity obligations under Section 7.6. All information
(including all reports, results and documentation containing such information)
acquired by Purchaser, the Environmental Consultant, or their respective
agents, employees or representatives, in conducting the Assessment under this
Section shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.2 NORM. Purchaser acknowledges the following:

(a) The Assets have been used for exploration, development, production,
processing and/or gathering of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other materials located on or under the Properties
or associated with the Assets.

(b) Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, Hazardous
Materials, or NORM.

(c) NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms.

(d) The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included
in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Materials.

(e) NORM containing material and other wastes or Hazardous Materials may have
come in contact with the soil.

(f) Special procedures may be required for the remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of soil, wastes, asbestos, Hazardous Materials,
and NORM from the Assets. 

Section 4.3 Notice of Violations of Environmental Laws.

(a) Purchaser shall deliver claim notices to Seller in writing (an
"Environmental Defect Notice"), on or before the day that is seven (7)
Business Days before the Scheduled Closing Date (the "Environmental Claim
Date"), of each individual matter that (a) causes any Asset (or Seller with
respect to any Asset) or the operation thereof to be in violation of any
Environmental Law or any Environmental Permit, or (b) that requires, if known,
or will require, once sufficiently discovered, reporting to a Governmental
Body, investigation, monitoring, removal, cleanup, remediation, restoration or
correction under Environmental Laws, in each case of (a) and (b) that would
result in the Environmental Defect Amount exceeding One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) (the "Individual Environmental Threshold") (either of (a)
or (b), an "Environmental Defect"). The Environmental Defect Notice shall
provide (i) a reasonably detailed description of the specific matter
constituting the alleged Environmental Defect (including, if applicable, the
Environmental Law violated, or giving rise to, such Environmental Defect);
(ii) to the extent known by Purchaser, the Assets affected; (iii) Purchaser's
reasonable estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount; and (iv) supporting
documents reasonably necessary to provide notice to Seller of the existence of
the alleged Environmental Defect. The failure of an Environmental Defect
Notice to contain, in all material respects, the items as set forth in clauses
(i) through (iv) of the prior sentence shall render such notice ineffective;
provided, however, such Environmental Defect Notice shall not be rendered
ineffective in the event that it is subsequently determined that the
Environmental Defect Amount estimated by Purchaser in clause (iii) is not the
Lowest Cost Response applicable to such Environmental Defect being described.
As used herein, the "Environmental Defect Amount" means an amount equal to the
cost of the Lowest Cost Response applicable to an Environmental Defect.

(b) For purposes of this Article 4, any Contract Acreage shall be deemed a
"Lease" or "Leases" subject to this Article 4, and the "Allocated Value" shall
be equal to the adjustment made on account of such Contract Acreage under
Section 2.2(l) (without taking into account any reductions for Title Defects
or Environmental Defects), subject in all respects to Section 2.5.

Section 4.4 Remedies for Violations of Environmental Laws.

(a) With respect to an Environmental Defect for which the Environmental Defect
Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold, then subject to
Seller's continuing right to contest an Environmental Defect or Environmental
Defect Amount under Section 4.4(b), Seller shall, by providing written notice
to Purchaser, elect one of the following options on or prior to Closing and/or
at the time specified below:

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Amount;

(ii) in the event the Environmental Defect Amount equals or exceeds seventy-
five percent (75%) of the Allocated Value of the Assets that are subject to
(or alleged to be subject to) the Environmental Defect, retain such Assets, in
which 

event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of the
Allocated Values of such Assets (determined without duplication);

(iii) perform or cause to be performed prior to the Closing, at the sole cost
and expense of Seller, such remedial or curative operations as are
contemplated by the Lowest Cost Response to address the alleged Environmental
Defect; or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.

If Seller elects the option set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i), then Purchaser
shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses
attributable to the remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect and all
Damages with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
be entitled to elect either of the remedies in Section 4.4(a)(ii) or Section
4.4(a)(iv), if applicable.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all timely alleged
Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts, and the sufficiency of
any cures performed pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(iii), prior to the Closing
Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree prior to the Closing Date,
the portion of such Environmental Defect Amounts attributable to such disputes
shall be deposited at Closing by Purchaser as part of the Defect Escrow
Amount, and the Environmental Defects, proposed cures, and Environmental
Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4(b). During the thirty (30) day period
following the Closing Date, Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect
Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to an environmental attorney with at
least ten (10) years' experience in evaluating the compliance with
Environmental Laws of oil and gas assets similarly situated to the Properties
in one or more of the jurisdictions where they are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller or absent such agreement during the
thirty (30) day period, by the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The Environmental
Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for any
Party or its Affiliates or have any financial interest in the dispute. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted
in English and in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section 4.4(b). The Environmental Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in Article 4 and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Environmental
Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties in advising
the arbitrator, including environmental attorneys from other states and
professional environmental consultants. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects, attempted cures, and Environmental Defect Amounts, as
applicable, submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting 

its case, and shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator. If Section 4.4(a)(ii) is applicable with respect to
an Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Amount but such Environmental
Defect or Environmental Defect Amount is to be determined by the Environmental
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 4.4(b), then within five (5) Business Days
after the Environmental Arbitrator has made a determination, either Seller or
Purchaser at its option may elect the option set forth in Section 4.4(a)(ii),
and any retained Assets under Section 4.4(a)(ii) shall become Excluded Assets
hereunder (and reassigned to Seller using a form of assignment substantially
similar to the Conveyance, mutatis mutandis, if previously assigned to
Purchaser), and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in Section
2.2 as if such Assets were excluded at Closing. The determination of the
Environmental Arbitrator (and any subsequent exclusion election by Seller or
Purchaser) shall be taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement;
provided that if such determination occurs after the Final Settlement Date,
then the terms of Section 9.4(b) and Section 9.4(c) shall apply to all
adjustments and payments pertaining to the Assets subject thereto to the
extent applicable, and in each case, the applicable portion of the Defect
Escrow Amount shall be released to the Party entitled to such amount.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for individual Environmental Defects for which the Environmental Defect
Amount does not exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold, and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Environmental Defect Amounts covered by Section 4.4(a)(i) that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold, exceeds a deductible in an
amount equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price (the
"Environmental Defect Deductible"), after which point Purchaser shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other available remedies
under this Section 4.4 with respect to Environmental Defects in excess of the
Environmental Defect Deductible, subject to the Individual Environmental
Threshold, Seller's elections under this Section 4.4 as applicable. The
Allocated Value of any Property (or affected portion thereof) retained by
Seller in accordance with Section 4.4(a)(ii) may not be used in meeting the
Environmental Defect Deductible.

Section 4.5 Limitations. Subject to Purchaser's remedy for a breach of
Seller's representations and warranties in Section 5.20 and for clause (E) of
the definition of "Retained Seller Obligations", this Article 4 is intended to
be the sole and exclusive remedy that Purchaser Indemnitees shall have against
Seller Indemnitees with respect to any matter or circumstance relating to
compliance with Environmental Laws or to Environmental Defects. Except to the
limited extent necessary to enforce the terms of this Article 4 and subject to
Purchaser's remedy for a breach of Seller's representations and warranties in
Section 5.20 and for clause (E) of the definition of "Retained Seller
Obligations", Purchaser (on behalf of itself, each of the other Purchaser
Indemnitees and their respective insurers and successors in interest) hereby
releases and discharges any and all claims and remedies at Law or in equity,
known or unknown, whether now existing or arising in the future, contingent or
otherwise, against the Seller Indemnitees with respect to any matter or
circumstance relating to any Environmental Defect, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS OR
DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT
OR CONCURRENT, EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL 

MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER INDEMNITEES.
Except as set forth in Section 5.20, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has
not made and will not make any representation or warranty regarding compliance
with Environmental Laws or any Environmental Defect, and that nothing in this
Agreement or otherwise shall be construed as such a representation or
warranty.

economic risk of its investment in the Purchaser Parent Common Stock, and has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Purchaser
Parent Common Stock taking into account Purchaser and Purchaser Parent's
representations, warranties and agreements hereunder. Seller is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Seller understands that neither the offer nor sale of the
Purchaser Parent Common Stock has been registered pursuant to the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities Laws (subject to the other terms of
this Agreement), that all of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock is subject to
substantial restrictions on transfer, that all of the Purchaser Parent Common
Stock will be characterized as "restricted securities" under federal
securities Laws, and that, under such Laws and applicable regulations, none of
the Purchaser Parent Common Stock can be sold or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption thereunder.

action restricted by this Section 7.5 shall be considered granted within five
(5) Business Days (unless a shorter time is reasonably 

required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Seller's
written notice) of Seller's notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless
Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event of an emergency or a serious risk to life,
property, or the environment, Seller may take or consent to such action as a
prudent operator, or non-operator as the case may be, would take and without
obtaining Purchaser's prior consent; provided Seller shall notify Purchaser of
such action promptly thereafter.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may own fractional undivided interest
in certain of the Assets and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of
the other working interest owners, partners or any operator who is not

owners or partners constitute such a violation so long as Seller has voted its
interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.5.

any related activities of the Purchaser Indemnitees prior to Closing, EVEN IF
CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY

WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

Section 7.7 Other Preferential Rights.

(a) Should a Third Party fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase
as to any portion of the Assets prior to the Closing and the time for exercise
or waiver has not yet expired, subject to the remaining provisions of this
Section 7.7, such Assets shall be included in the transaction at the Closing,
such preferential right to purchase shall be a Permitted Encumbrance
hereunder, and the following procedures shall be applicable. If one or more of
the holders of any such preferential right to purchase notifies Seller (or
Purchaser) subsequent to the Closing that it intends to assert its
preferential purchase right, Seller shall give notice thereof to Purchaser,
whereupon Purchaser shall satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, all such
preferential purchaser right obligations of Seller to such holders and shall
indemnify and hold harmless all Seller Indemnitees from and against any and
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including court
costs, expert fees and reasonable attorney's fees) in connection therewith,
and Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be entitled to receive (and Seller
hereby assigns to Purchaser all of Seller's rights to) all proceeds, received
from such holders in connection with such preferential rights to purchase. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, should any Third Party bring any Proceeding seeking
to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce preferential rights,
the Assets or portion thereof subject to such Proceeding shall be excluded
from the Assets transferred at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets or portions thereof.
Promptly after the Proceeding is dismissed or settled or a judgment is
rendered in favor of Seller, as applicable, Seller shall sell to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice from Seller of such dismissal, settlement or judgment, all such
Assets or portions thereof not being sold to the Third Party for a purchase
price equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets or portions thereof, and the

2.3; provided, however, Seller shall have no obligation of sale under this
paragraph if the applicable dismissal, settlement or judgment does not occur

such Property Taxes occurred, and (3) Property Taxes that are ad valorem,
property or other Property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a
Tax period beginning before and ending after the Effective Time shall be
allocated between the portion of such period ending at the Effective Time and
the portion of such period beginning immediately after the Effective Time by
prorating each such Property Tax based on the number of days in such period
that occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one
hand, and the number of days in such period that occur from and after the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause
(3) of the preceding sentence, ad valorem and real property Taxes assessed for
a particular Tax period shall be deemed 

"attributable" to such period, even if such assessment is valued based upon
production or other data for prior Tax periods.

(iii) This Section 7.8(a) shall not apply to Income Taxes and Tax Returns
therefor, which shall be borne, paid and filed by the Party responsible for
such Taxes under applicable Law.

(b) Regardless of which Party is responsible, Seller shall handle payment to
the appropriate Governmental Body of all Property Taxes which are required to
be paid on or prior to Closing Date (and shall file all Tax Returns with
respect to such Property Taxes), and, except as provided in the TSA, Purchaser
shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Property
Taxes with respect to any Tax period that ends before or includes the
Effective Time which are required to be paid after the Closing Date (and shall
file all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect
to such Taxes). If requested by Purchaser, Seller will assist Purchaser with
the preparation of all Tax Returns for Property Taxes due on or before sixty
(60) days after the Closing (including any extensions requested). Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of filing copies of all Tax
Returns filed by Seller pursuant to this Section 7.8(b) with respect to Tax
periods (or portions thereof) beginning at or after the Effective Time, along
with any supporting documentation provided by Seller to Governmental Bodies.
The Parties agree that (1) this Section 7.8(b) is intended to solely address
the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to Property Taxes
are filed and the Property Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable
taxing authority, and (2) nothing in this Section 7.8(b) shall be interpreted
as altering the manner in which Property Taxes are allocated to and
economically borne by the Parties.

(c) Control of any legal or administrative Proceedings concerning any Property
Taxes affecting the Assets shall belong to the Party responsible for such
Property Taxes under Section 7.8(a); provided that (x) Purchaser shall have
the right to participate (at its sole cost and expense) in any such
Proceedings controlled by Seller in accordance with this Section 7.8(c) the
resolution of which could affect Purchaser's liability for Property Taxes
under Section 7.8(a) and (y) Seller shall not settle or compromise any such
Proceeding described in clause (x) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(d) Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Property Taxes
allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 7.8(a) and Purchaser shall be entitled
to any and all refunds of Property Taxes allocated to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 7.8(a). If Seller or Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Seller or
Purchaser) receives a refund of any Property Taxes (whether by payment, credit
offset or otherwise, with any interest thereon) to which the other Party is
entitled pursuant to this Section 7.8(d), the Party that received (or whose
Affiliate that received) such refund shall promptly (but no later than thirty
(30) days after receipt) remit payment to such other Party of an amount equal
to the refund amount, including all relevant documentation, net of any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by such recipient Party in
procuring such refund. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other and its Affiliates in order to take all reasonably
necessary 

steps to claim any refund to which such other Party is entitled. Purchaser
agrees to notify Seller within ten (10) days following the discovery of a
right to claim any refund to which Seller is entitled and upon receipt of any
such refund. Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall
not and shall not permit its Affiliates to amend any Tax Returns with respect
to Taxes for which Seller is liable under Section 7.8(a) or for which Seller
may be liable to indemnify Purchaser under Section 11.2.

(e) The Parties agree that either or both of Seller and Purchaser may elect to
treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an exchange of like-kind
property under Section 1031 of the Code (an "Exchange"), provided, that the
Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. Each Party agrees to
use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in the completion of
such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in
Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right at any
time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its rights under this
Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury
Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder
(as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure
2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
neither an assignment of a Party's rights under this Agreement nor any other
actions taken by a Party or any other person in connection with the Exchange
shall release any Party from, or modify, any of its liabilities and
obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this
Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any particular Tax
treatment that may be afforded to the other Party by reason of such assignment
or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange. Any Party electing
to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an Exchange shall be
obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result of the
Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the other Party, the
Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated with
the Exchange and to indemnify and hold the other Party, its Affiliates, and
their respective former, current and future partners, members, shareholders,
owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all liabilities and Taxes arising out of,
based upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or transactions or
actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been
incurred by the other Party but for the electing Party's Exchange election.

(f) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information (excluding those
protected by attorney-client or work-product privilege) that are relevant to
any such Tax Return or Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided under this Agreement.

Section 7.9 Special Warranty of Title. The Conveyance shall contain a covenant
of Seller to warrant Defensible Title to the Subject Properties after the
Closing from and against the 

lawful claims of Third Parties arising by, through or under Seller and its
Affiliates, but not otherwise (the "Special Warranty").

Section 7.10 Suspended Proceeds. Seller shall transfer and remit to Purchaser,
in the form of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(k),
all monies representing the value or proceeds of production removed or sold
from the Properties and held by Seller at the time of the Closing for accounts
from which payment has been suspended, such monies being hereinafter called
"Suspended Proceeds". Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the proper
distribution of such Suspended Proceeds to the Person or Persons which or who
are entitled to receive payment of the same.

Section 7.11 Non-Compete.

(a) As a material inducement for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, and
in order to protect the confidential information that is conveyed by Seller
hereunder, Seller agrees that, from and after the Execution Date until one
year after the Execution Date, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its
Affiliates and each of their respective successors and Senior Management
Employees to not, directly or indirectly (including through any joint venture
or other entity), other than on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
purchase, acquire, farm-in or earn (or acquire the right to or any option to,
purchase, acquire, farm-in or earn) (A) any Hydrocarbon interests or any other
oil and gas rights located in the area indicated on Schedule 7.11 (such area,
the "Restricted Area"), or (B) the equity interests (other than Purchaser
Parent Common Stock) of any Person that owns Hydrocarbon interests or any
other oil and gas rights located in the Restricted Area (except for
acquisitions of less than one percent (1.0%) of the equity interests of any
public entity, or of any Person, private or public, for which no more than ten
percent (10%) of its owned Hydrocarbon interests or oil and gas rights are
located in the Restricted Area as of the date of such acquisition), in each
case, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which may withheld at
Purchaser's sole discretion.

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the geographic scope, scope of
activity restrictions, and duration of the covenants contained in this Section
7.11 are the result of arm's-length bargaining and are fair and reasonable in
light of (1) the fact that the Assets acquired by Purchaser hereunder were
associated with the Seller's or its' Affiliates' businesses conducted
throughout the Restricted Area, and are intended to be operated by Purchaser
throughout the Restricted Area; and (2) Seller's level of control over and
contact with the Assets prior to the Closing, and knowledge of the
confidential information conveyed hereunder. Seller further acknowledges and
agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.11 are not against
public policy and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to
protect the legitimate business interests of Purchaser, have been specifically
negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties, and constitute a material
inducement for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The covenants contained in this
Section 7.11 and each provision (and portion) hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions (and portions). The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision (or portion) as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions (or portions) 

hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision (or portion)
in any other jurisdiction. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the
provisions of this Section 7.11 (and portions thereof) be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that this
Section 7.11 is reasonable and enforceable in all respects; nonetheless, if
any of the restrictions of this Section 7.11 (or portions thereof) are found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, overly broad, or
otherwise unenforceable, the Parties intend that such restrictions (and
portions thereof) shall not be thereby terminated but shall be modified by
such court so as to be valid and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully
enforced. Each Party further acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach
of this Section 7.11 would cause irreparable harm to Purchaser for which it
would have no adequate remedy at law, that it would be impractical and
extremely difficult to determine Purchaser's and its Affiliates' damages in
the event of a breach or threatened breach, and that Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and specific
performance as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be the
exclusive remedies for a breach or threatened breach of this Section 7.11 but
shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law and equity,
including the recovery of damages.

Section 7.12 Confidentiality.

(a) Effective upon Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will be
automatically deemed terminated. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
provisions of this Agreement shall be kept confidential, and each Party shall
cause its Affiliates and instruct its representatives to keep this Agreement
confidential, except as disclosure (i) may be required by applicable Law,
rules and regulations of Governmental Bodies or stock exchanges, (ii) of
information that is available to the public on the Closing Date, or thereafter
becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 7.12(a), (iii) to the extent required to be disclosed in connection
with complying with or obtaining a waiver of any preferential purchase right
or consents to assignment (including the negotiation and execution of the
University Lands Agreement), (iv) to the extent that such Party must disclose
the same in any proceeding brought by it to enforce its rights under this
Agreement, (v) is contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or (vi) to any
potential subsequent purchaser of any Assets, or to investors or limited
partners of Seller's private equity fund members with respect to financial or
economic returns or performance and similar financially-focused information if
disclosed on a confidential basis. This Section 7.12(a) shall not prevent
either Party from recording the assignments and other instruments of
conveyance to be delivered at the Closing or from complying with any
disclosure requirements of Governmental Bodies that are applicable to the
transfer of the Assets. The covenant set forth in this Section 7.12(a) shall
terminate two years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
after Closing, either Party or its Affiliates may disclose high-level summary
financial information regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in industry conference presentations or similar disclosures to
potential or actual limited investors; provided, Seller shall not disclose the
name of Purchaser or its Affiliates in any such disclosures. 

(b) Effective as of and after Closing, for a period of one year following the
Closing Date, and except as required by Law or rule (including a rule of any
stock exchange), Seller shall not, and shall direct its officers, directors
and employees not to, disclose to any third party any confidential information
regarding the Assets, but not including information that (i) is generally
available to the public as of the Closing Date or (ii) becomes generally
available to the public after the Closing Date other than as a result of
disclosure by Seller in violation of this Section 7.12(b); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not restrict such disclosures to the extent (1)
necessary for Seller to perform this Agreement (including such disclosure to
Governmental Bodies or third parties holding any preferential purchase right
or consents to assignment or other rights that may be applicable to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as is reasonably necessary to
provide notices, seek waivers, amendments or termination of such rights, or
seek such consents and disclosure to any representatives of Seller to the
extent necessary to assist Seller with the performance of their obligations
hereunder), (2) required by applicable securities or other Laws or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the Parties or
their respective Affiliates, (3) necessary for Tax or financial statement
purposes, (4) related to any dispute under or related to this Agreement, the
other documents executed pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (5) disclosed in connection
with a Party enforcing its rights under this Agreement, or (6) disclosed to
investors or limited partners of Seller's private equity fund members with
respect to financial or economic returns or performance and similar
financially-focused information if disclosed on a confidential basis.

(c) Each Party agrees that the other Party will not have an adequate remedy at
Law if a Party violates any of the terms of Section 7.12. In such event, the
Parties agree that the non-defaulting Party will have the right, in addition
to any others it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach
or threatened breach of the terms of Section 7.12 or to seek specific
performance of such terms.

Section 7.13 Listing of Stock Consideration. At the Closing, Purchaser Parent
shall issue the Stock Consideration in accordance with all applicable
securities Laws and the rules and policies of The New York Stock Exchange.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser Parent shall
complete all such filings with The New York Stock Exchange and otherwise take
all such actions as may be reasonably necessary for the Stock Consideration to
be accepted by The New York Stock Exchange for issuance and approved for
listing thereon from and after the time of Closing, subject to official notice
of issuance. If Purchaser Parent applies to have the Purchaser Parent Common
Stock or other securities traded on any principal stock exchange or market
other than The New York Stock Exchange, it shall include in such application
the Stock Consideration and will take such other action as is necessary to
cause such Stock Consideration to be so listed.

Section 7.14 Conduct of Business of Purchaser Parties. Except (A) as expressly
contemplated by the other provisions of this Agreement, (B) as required by
applicable Law, or (C) as consented to in writing by Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, until the Closing,
the Purchaser Parties: 

(a) shall operate in the ordinary course of business;

(b) shall not amend their Charter Documents;

(c) shall not liquidate, dissolve, recapitalize or otherwise wind up any
Purchaser Party;

(d) except to the extent that an appropriate Make-Whole Adjustment has been
mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser Parent in writing, adopt a plan of
complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, exchange, consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of any Purchaser
Party;

(e) except to the extent that an appropriate Make-Whole Adjustment has been
mutually agreed by Sellers and Purchaser Parent in writing, declare, set
aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution on any capital stock or
other equity interests of any Purchaser Party, whether payable in cash or
other equity interests, property or otherwise, other than any regular cash
distributions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
with customary record and payment dates; or

(f) except to the extent that an appropriate Make-Whole Adjustment has been
mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser Parent in writing, reclassify,
combine, split, subdivide or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly
or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity interests of Purchaser
Parent.

Section 7.15 Required Financial and Reserve Information.

(a) From and after the Execution Date, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser
Parent, its Affiliates and Purchaser Parent's auditors in connection with the
preparation of any financial statements of Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates
pertaining to the Assets and any related pro forma financial statements or
other financial information, and the conduct of audits or reviews of such
financial statements, required under federal securities Laws or rules and
regulations of the SEC or under customary practice for securities offerings
made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, in connection with (i)
any filing by Purchaser Parent or any of its Affiliates with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or (ii) any offering memorandum or
similar document relating to a private offering of securities of Purchaser
Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or
otherwise. In connection with such cooperation, from and after the Execution
Date, Seller shall: (A) provide to Purchaser Parent, its Affiliates and
Purchaser Parent's auditors reasonable access to the books, records,
information, and documents that are related to the Assets and Seller that are
in Seller's possession or control reasonably required by Purchaser Parent, its
Affiliates, and Purchaser Parent's auditors in order to prepare, audit, and
review such financial statements and other financial information; (B) provide
to Purchaser Parent, its Affiliates, and Purchaser Parent's auditors
reasonable access to Seller's officers, managers, employees, agents, and
representatives who were responsible for preparing or maintaining the
financial records and work papers and other supporting documents used in the
preparation of such financial statements; (C) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver one or more customary representation letters from Seller to
such Purchaser Parent's 

auditors that are reasonably requested to allow such auditors to complete an
audit or review of any such financial statements; and (D) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the independent auditor of Seller that conducted
any audit of such financial statements to (1) consent to the use of such
independent auditor's report, and to be named as an expert or as having
prepared such report, in any SEC filing or offering memorandum or similar
document referred to above and (2) provide customary "comfort letters" to any
underwriter or purchaser in a securities offering by Purchaser Parent or its
Affiliates.

(b) Purchaser Parent shall reimburse Seller, within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of demand in writing therefor, together with such reasonable
supporting documents as may be requested by Purchaser Parent, for all third-
party costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Seller in connection with
Seller's compliance with this Section 7.15, excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, reimbursement of overhead, salaries, or benefits attributable to
Seller's and its Affiliates' employees for the provision of such assistance
and cooperation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand
Seller's representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates, or any Third Party any
rights to which it is not entitled hereunder.

Section 7.16 Purchaser Parent Share Restriction. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending ninety (90) days after the Closing Date
(excluding the Closing Date for purposes of calculating such date, "Purchaser
Parent Share Restriction Period"), Seller will not offer, sell, contract to
sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration, enter into
a transaction which would have the same effect, or enter into any Hedge or
other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of the shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock
constituting the Stock Consideration, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of the shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock
constituting the Stock Consideration or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale,
pledge, or disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, Hedge, or other
arrangement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Hedges entered into
following the commencement of the Purchaser Parent Share Restriction Period
but settled subsequent to the termination of the Purchaser Parent Share
Restriction Period. Nothing in this Section 7.16 shall prohibit or limit the
ability to effect any transfer of Purchaser Parent Common Stock (a) to any
Affiliate of Seller, (a) through a distribution to the equityholders of Seller
or its Affiliates or any of their respective equityholders, members, limited
partners, general partners, or Affiliates, or (a) to any investment fund or
other entity controlled or managed by any Affiliate of Seller; provided that,
in the case of the preceding clauses (a)-(c), (i) the transferee agrees to be
bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein and (i) any such
transfer shall not involve a disposition for value.

Section 7.17 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party agrees to take
such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
documents as are reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the
purposes of this Agreement or of any other Transaction Document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.

of the Purchaser Parties set forth in Article 6 are true and correct as of the
Execution Date and as of the Closing Date, in each case as though made on and
as of the Closing Date (other than representations and warranties that refer
to a specified date, which are true and correct on and as of such specified
date), except for such breaches, if any, as would not have a Purchaser Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (provided that to the extent such
representation or warranty is qualified by its terms by Purchaser Parent
Material Adverse Effect, material adverse effect or other materiality
qualifier, such qualification in its terms shall be inapplicable for purposes
of this certification 

and the Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect and material adverse effect
qualification contained in this certification shall apply in lieu thereof),
and (ii) the Purchaser Parties have performed and observed, in all material
respects, all covenants and agreements to be performed or observed by them
under this Agreement prior to or on the Closing Date;

(g) a counterpart of the TSA executed by Purchaser;

(h) a counterpart of the Registration Rights Agreement, duly executed by
Purchaser;

(i) the Escrowed Shares to the Indemnity Escrow Agent;

(j) the Defect Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Purchaser;

(k) the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Purchaser; and

(l) joint written instructions instructing the Deposit Escrow Agent to release
the Deposit to Seller, duly executed by Purchaser.

Section 9.4 Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) Not later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best information
available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating the
adjusted Cash Consideration after giving effect to all adjustments to the Cash
Consideration set forth in Section 2.2 and the Deposit. The estimate delivered
in accordance with this Section 9.4(a) shall be used to calculate the Cash
Consideration to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing (the "Closing
Payment").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser a statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted
Cash Consideration and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to
the extent possible on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items
before and after the Effective Time and taking into account all adjustments
provided for in this Agreement. Seller shall supply reasonable documentation
available to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item. As soon as
reasonably practicable but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following
receipt of Seller's statement and such documentation hereunder, Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that Purchaser
proposes to be made to such statement. Purchaser may not later contest or
submit to the Independent Expert any amounts or adjustments that were not
contested in Purchaser's written report, which amounts or adjustments
Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted. If Purchaser does not timely
deliver such written report within such thirty (30) day period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to agree with the adjustments set forth in Seller's statement.
Seller may not later contest or submit to the Independent Expert any amounts
or adjustments that were not set forth in Seller's statement. The Parties
shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Cash
Consideration no later than one hundred forty five (145) days after the
Closing Date (to the extent such statement is final, the "Final Settlement
Statement"). In the event that the Parties cannot agree on 

the Adjusted Cash Consideration within one hundred forty five (145) days after
the Closing Date, the specific disputed items will be automatically referred
to an independent expert of the Parties' choosing with at least ten (10) years
of oil and gas accounting experience for arbitration (the "Independent
Expert"). If the Parties are unable to agree upon an Independent Expert, then
such Independent Expert shall be selected by any Federal District Court or
State District Court Judge in Houston, Texas. The Independent Expert shall
conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 9.4(b). The
Independent Expert's determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall, without limiting Purchaser's
right to indemnity under Section 11.2(c)(v), be final and binding on both
Parties, without right of appeal; provided that disputes relating to any Title
Defects or Environmental Defects (including adjustments or remedies to be
provided on account thereof) shall be resolved in accordance with Section
3.4(h) and Section 4.4(b), respectively. In determining the proper amount of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Independent Expert shall not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by any Party
and may not award damages or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case, and shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert. Within ten (10) days after the date on which the
Parties agree (or are deemed to agree) on the Final Settlement Statement or
the Independent Expert finally determines the disputed matters, as applicable,
(i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the final adjusted Cash
Consideration exceeds the sum of the Closing Payment plus the Deposit or (ii)
Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the sum of the Closing
Payment plus the Deposit exceeds the final adjusted Cash Consideration, as
applicable. The Final Settlement Statement that is agreed or determined shall
be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes under Section 2.2,
Section 2.3 and this Section 9.4, and no Party shall be entitled to any
further adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject to Section 9.4(c).

(c) In the event that any Properties or Contract Acreage are subject to
unresolved Title Defects, Environmental Defects, University Lands Consents,
Consent Requirements or preferential rights to purchase as of the Final
Settlement Date, or any unresolved accounting adjustments under Section 2.2
directly related thereto (which for the avoidance of doubt would be resolved
by the Independent Expert, except as otherwise agreed or as provided elsewhere
in this Agreement), then within ten (10) Business Days after the resolution of
each such matter (or all such matters if agreed by Purchaser and Seller),
Purchaser and Seller shall further account and make payments to one another in
a manner consistent with Section 2.2 to appropriately reflect the resolution
of each such matter, taking into account the adjustments and payments
previously made with the Final Settlement Statement.

(d) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be in cash by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Seller
pursuant to the 

wiring instructions reflected in Schedule 9.4(d) or as separately provided in
writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be in
cash by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank and
account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination. Subject to Section 10.2, this Agreement may be
terminated: (a) at any time prior to Closing by the mutual prior written
consent of Seller and the Purchaser Parties, (b) by Seller or the Purchaser
Parties if Closing has not occurred on or before March 12, 2018 (the
"Termination Date"), (c) by the Purchaser Parties if any condition set forth
in Section 8.2 has not been satisfied or waived by the Purchaser Parties at
Closing, or (d) by Seller if any condition set forth in Section 8.1 has not
been satisfied or waived by Seller at Closing; provided, however, that
termination under clauses (b), (c) or (d) shall not be effective until the
Party electing to terminate has delivered written notice to the other Party of
its election to so terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Party's
failure to perform or observe any of its covenants or obligations under this
Agreement, or the inaccuracy of any of its representations, has been the cause
of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of Closing to occur on or prior to
the Termination Date because the conditions to the other Party's obligation to
perform at Closing in Article 8 have not been satisfied, the defaulting Party
shall not be entitled to exercise any right of termination under this Section
10.1.

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1, except as set forth in this Section 10.2 or Section
10.3, or is validly terminated pursuant to Section 2.4, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further force or effect (except for the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of Sections 5.6, 6.5, 7.6, 10.2, 10.3, 11.7, 12.2,
12.4, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.11, 12.12, 12.14, 12.15, 12.16, 12.17, 12.18 and
12.19, and all disclaimers herein, all of which shall survive such termination
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms) and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without any
further action or liability to any Party or its respective Indemnitees, and
following such termination, Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all
rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under this
Agreement.

Section 10.3 Remedies Upon Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or
Section 10.1(d), Seller has performed or is ready, willing and able to perform
all of its agreements and covenants contained herein in all material respects
which are to be performed or observed at the Closing, and the Purchaser
Parties have materially breached (or with respect to payments of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, any breach) any of the agreements or covenants of the
Purchaser Parties contained herein which are to be performed or observed at
the Closing, then (i) Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall promptly execute
joint written instructions to the Deposit Escrow Agent authorizing the Deposit
Escrow Agent to release the Deposit to Seller and (ii) Seller may retain the
Deposit as liquidated damages as Seller's 

sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by the
Purchaser Parties under this Agreement, except for the indemnities provided in
Section 7.6, and all other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement
(except for the provisions that survive pursuant to Section 10.2, which shall
remain in full force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by Seller. Seller
and the Purchaser Parties agree upon the Deposit as liquidated damages due to
the difficulty and inconvenience of measuring actual damages and the
uncertainty thereof, and Seller and the Purchaser Parties agree that such
amount would be a reasonable estimate of Seller's loss in the event of any
such breach or failure to perform by the Purchaser Parties. Upon such
termination, Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership
of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the
Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser Parties pursuant to
Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(c), the Purchaser Parties have performed or
are ready, willing and able to perform all of the agreements and covenants of
the Purchaser Parties contained herein in all material respects which are to
be performed or observed at the Closing, and Seller has materially breached
any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed
or observed at the Closing, then at the option of the Purchaser Parties:

(i) (i) Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall promptly execute joint written
instructions to the Deposit Escrow Agent authorizing the Deposit Escrow Agent
to release the Deposit to the Purchaser Parties, (ii) the Purchaser Parties
shall receive the Deposit and (iii) the Purchaser Parties shall be entitled to
seek money damages from Seller available at Law for Seller's applicable breach
of this Agreement subject to Section 12.18, as the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Purchaser Parties for any breach or failure to perform by Seller under
this Agreement, and all other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement
(except for the provisions that survive pursuant to Section 10.2, which shall
remain in full force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by the Purchaser
Parties, and Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership
of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the
Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

(ii) in lieu of termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of this Agreement, it being specifically
agreed that monetary damages will not be sufficient to compensate the
Purchaser Parties if the Purchaser Parties determine the same in the sole
discretion of the Purchaser Parties. To seek specific performance and as a
condition thereto, the Purchaser Parties must deliver the notice in writing to
Seller of the election of the Purchaser Parties to seek specific performance
under this Section 10.3(b)(ii) within thirty (30) days counted from and after
the Termination Date. If the Purchaser Parties elect to seek specific
performance of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.3(b)(ii), the
Deposit shall be held by Deposit Escrow Agent, until a non-appealable final
judgment or award on the claim of the Purchaser Parties for specific
performance is rendered, at which time Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall
promptly execute joint written instructions to the Deposit Escrow Agent
authorizing the Deposit Escrow Agent to 

distribute the Deposit as provided in the judgment or award resolving the
specific performance claim or shall be applied as provided in Section 2.4 of
this Agreement. Seller hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants and agreements of Seller under this Agreement. The
Purchaser Parties shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Purchaser Parties
hereto further agree that (A) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
paragraph, including by the institution of a court proceeding, the Purchaser
Parties shall not in any respect waive the right of the Purchaser Parties to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to the Purchaser Parties
under this Agreement (including those set forth in Section 10.2 and Section
10.3(b)(i)) in the event that the remedies provided for in this paragraph are
not available or otherwise are not granted, and (B) nothing set forth in this
paragraph shall require the Purchaser Parties to institute any Proceeding for
(or limit the right of the Purchaser Parties to institute a Proceeding for)
specific performance prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under this Article 10, nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding
pursuant to this paragraph restrict or limit the right of the Purchaser
Parties to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Article 10.

(c) If this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in
Section 10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b), Seller and the Purchaser Parties shall
promptly execute joint written instructions to the Deposit Escrow Agent
authorizing the Deposit Escrow Agent to release the Deposit to the Purchaser
Parties, free of any claims by Seller to the Deposit, and the terms of Section
10.2 shall apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be entitled to receive interest on the Deposit, whether the Deposit
is applied against the Purchase Price or returned to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 10.3.

ARTICLE 11

WAIVERS

Section 11.1 Receipts.

following the Final Settlement Date shall be treated as follows: (i) all
production from or attributable to the Assets (and all products and proceeds
attributable thereto) and all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits
earned with respect to the Assets to which Purchaser is entitled under Section

receipt of the same, and (ii) all production from or attributable to the
Assets (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other

Closing Date.

Section 11.2 Assumption and Indemnification.

(a) Without limiting the Purchaser Parties' rights to indemnity under this
Article 11, on and effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser hereby assumes
and hereby agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be
fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) all of the obligations and
liabilities of Seller, known or unknown, with respect to the Assets,
regardless of whether such obligations or liabilities arose prior to, on or
after the Effective Time, including but not limited to (i) obligations to

and (vii) continuing obligations, if any, under any Contracts or other
agreements pursuant to which Seller or its Affiliates purchased or acquired
Assets prior to the Closing (all of said obligations and liabilities, subject
to the exclusions below, herein being referred to as the "Assumed Seller
Obligations"), it being understood that Purchaser shall similarly bear all
risk of loss associated with the Assets (including changes in condition) to
the extent set forth in Section 3.6; provided, however, that the Assumed
Seller Obligations do not include and Purchaser does not assume any (x) Seller
Taxes or (y) obligations or liabilities of Seller to the extent, and only
during the applicable survival period, that they are Seller Indemnity
Obligations.

(b) Except for Damages for which Seller is required to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnitees under Section 11.2(c) at the time an applicable Claim Notice is
provided to Seller, from and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Seller 

Indemnitees from and against all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller
Indemnitees caused by, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) the Assumed Seller Obligations;

(ii) the ownership, use or operation of the Assets at and after the Closing
Date;

(iii) the breach by any Purchaser Party of such Purchaser Party's covenants or
agreements herein that survive the Closing;

(iv) any breach asserted during the applicable survival period of any
representation or warranty made by any Purchaser Party contained in Article 6
of this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by the Purchaser Parties at
Closing pursuant to Section 9.3(f) (disregarding any materiality, material
adverse effect or Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers in such
certificate); or

(v) any claims or actions asserted by Persons (including Governmental Bodies)
with respect to any violation of Environmental Law with respect to an Asset or
any remediation or other corrective action required for an Asset under any
Environmental Law regardless of whether known or unknown, or whether
attributable to periods of time before, on or after the Effective Time.

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER
INDEMNITEES OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OTHER THAN THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLER INDEMNITIES OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

(c) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser Indemnitees against and from all Damages incurred or suffered by
Purchaser Indemnitees to the extent caused by, arising out of or resulting
from (the "Seller Indemnity Obligations"):

(i) any breach asserted during the applicable survival period of any of
Seller's covenants or agreements herein;

(ii) any breach asserted during the applicable survival period of any
representation or warranty made by Seller contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to
Section 9.2(d) (disregarding any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers in such certificate);

(iii) the Excluded Assets;

(iv) the Retained Seller Obligations; or 

(v) any and all Seller Taxes.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except for the rights of the Parties under Article 10, Section 7.6 and the
Special Warranty in the Conveyances (subject to Section 7.9), this Section
11.2 contains the Parties' exclusive remedy against each other with respect to
breaches of this Agreement, including breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Articles 5 and 6, the covenants and agreements that
survive the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in the certificates delivered by the Parties at Closing pursuant to
Sections 9.2(d) or 9.3(f), as applicable, it being acknowledged that the
Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any
further indemnification or other rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereby waive. Except for the
remedies contained in this Section 11.2 and for the rights of the Parties
under Article 10, Section 7.6 and the Special Warranty in the Conveyance
(subject to Section 7.9), each Purchaser Party (on behalf of itself, each of
the other Purchaser Indemnitees and their respective insurers and successors
in interest) releases, remises and forever discharges the Seller Indemnitees
from any and all Damages whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown,
which such Persons might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, Seller's ownership, use or operation of the
Assets, the Assumed Seller Obligations, or the condition, quality, status or
nature of the Assets, including rights to contribution under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
and under other Environmental Laws, breaches of statutory or implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages and
common law rights of contribution, rights under agreements between Seller and
any Persons who are Affiliates of Seller, and rights under insurance
maintained by Seller or any Person who is an Affiliate of Seller, EVEN IF
CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON, excluding, however, any contractual rights between (i)
Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Affiliates and (ii) Seller or any of Seller's
Affiliates under the Transaction Documents.

(e) "Damages", for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean the amount of any
actual liability, loss, cost, diminution in value, expense, claim, demand,
notice of violation, investigation by any Governmental Body, administrative or
other Proceeding, payment, charge, obligation, fine, penalty, deficiency,
award or judgment incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party arising out of
or resulting from the indemnified matter, including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts
reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement
of the indemnity; provided, however, that no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.2 for Damages that
constitute (i) Damages that are waived or not recoverable under Section 12.18
or (ii) Damages that arise from a liability, loss, cost, expense for which
Purchaser receives an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2 to
the extent of such adjustment; provided, further, that no Seller Indemnitee
shall be entitled to 

indemnification under this Section 11.2 for Damages that constitute (A)
Damages that are waived or not recoverable under Section 12.18 or (B) Damages
that arise from a liability, loss, cost, expense for which Seller receives an
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2 to the extent of such
adjustment.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a document to be
delivered hereto to the contrary, any claim for indemnity to which a Seller
Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled must be asserted by and through
Seller or any Purchaser Party, as applicable.

(g) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity under Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates). Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, to the extent
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow the
Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in
accordance with this Agreement.

Section 11.3 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under
Section 11.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Party pursuant
to this Article 11, subject to Section 11.2(f).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Article 11, an Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 11.3,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third
Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 11.3
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.2
except to the extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability
to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was inaccurate or
breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have fourteen (14) Business Days from its receipt
of the Claim 

Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such fourteen (14) Business Day period, to
file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party all costs of which shall be
included as Damages in respect of such claim for indemnification. The failure
to provide notice to the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be a denial of
liability, except as may be provided in a subsequent notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and all related Proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.
If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost without any right
of reimbursement, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).
Irrespective of whether the Indemnified Party elects to participate in
contesting a Third Party Claim subject to this Section 11.3(d) in accordance
with the foregoing sentence, the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and
expense shall provide to the Indemnified Party the following information with
respect to the Third Party Claim: all filings made by any party; all written
communications exchanged between any parties to the extent available to the
Indemnifying Party and not subject to a restriction on disclosure to the
Indemnified Party or potential waiver of attorney-client privilege in favor of
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party; and all orders, opinions,
rulings or motions. The Indemnifying Party shall deliver the foregoing items
to the Indemnified Party promptly after they become available to the
Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include a written
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim, or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party, in each case except for any settlement
made by the Indemnifying Party in which the only consideration is the payment
of money damages (or similar consideration) and/or obligations undertaken by
the Indemnifying Party and which payment and/or undertaking would otherwise
resolve all or a portion of the Third Party Claim.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle a Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against such Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall 

send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed payment or
settlement, whether whole or partial, and the Indemnifying Party shall have
the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in
writing its liability for the Third Party Claim or portion thereof and (ii) if
liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
payment or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party fails to respond and admit in
writing its liability during such ten (10) day period, the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have denied liability and not approved such proposed payment
or settlement.

disputed the claim for such Damages.

Section 11.4 Limitation on Actions.

(a) All representations and warranties of Seller and the Purchaser Parties
contained herein shall survive until the date that is twelve (12) months from
and after the Closing Date and expire thereafter; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4,
5.6 and 5.8, and the representations and warranties of the Purchaser Parties
contained in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10 shall survive

agreements contained in the certificate delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Sections 9.2(d) and 9.3(f), as applicable, shall survive the
Closing as to each representation, warranty covenant and agreement so affirmed
for the same period of time that the specific representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this Section 11.4, and
shall expire thereafter. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect after the respective
date of their expiration, after which time no claim may be asserted thereunder
by any Person; provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration or
termination date.

(b) The indemnities in Section 11.2(b)(iii) and Section 11.2(b)(iv) shall
terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in
each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has
been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.
Purchaser's indemnities in Sections 7.6, 11.2(b)(i), 11.2(b)(ii) and
11.2(b)(v) shall continue without time limit. Seller's indemnities in Section
11.2 

(c)(i) and Section 11.2(c)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of
each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Party on or before such termination date. Seller's indemnity in Section
11.2(c)(iii) and Section 11.2(c)(v) shall continue without time limit (but in
the case of Section 11.2(c)(v), subject however to the applicable statutes of
limitations). Seller's indemnity in Section 11.2(c)(iv) shall terminate on the
second anniversary of the Closing, except that with respect to clause (B) of
the defined term of "Retained Seller Obligations", Seller's indemnity in
Section 11.2(c)(iv) shall terminate on the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this

based on a breach of Seller's representation in Section 5.6 or Section 5.8,

Purchase Price under Section 2.2 and any payments in respect thereof:

(i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
11.2(c)(ii) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or
judgment that does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and
such individual Damages may not be applied towards the Indemnity Deductible;

(ii) Subject to Section 11.4(c)(i), Seller shall not have any liability for
indemnification under Section 11.2(c)(ii) until and unless the aggregate
amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are timely
delivered by the Purchaser Parties exceeds a deductible amount equal to one
and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price (the "Indemnity
Deductible"), after which point the Purchaser Parties (or Purchaser
Indemnitees) shall be entitled to claim Damages in excess of the Indemnity
Deductible; and

(iii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Parties and
Purchaser Indemnitees under Section 11.2(c)(ii) or Section 11.2(c)(i) (as it
pertains to Section 7.5) for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent (10%)
of the Purchase Price.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Seller's aggregate liability arising from claims under this
Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.

(e) Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Parties under
Section 11.2(c)(ii) for any Property Tax (or portion thereof) allocable to
Purchaser under Section 7.8(a) as a result of a breach by Seller of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 5.8, except to the extent the
amount of such Property Tax (or portion thereof) (i) exceeds the amount that
would have been due absent such breach or (ii) was taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Sections 2.2 or 9.4. 

Section 11.5 Escrow Claims.

(a) At Closing, the Purchaser Parties, Seller and the Indemnity Escrow Agent
shall execute the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and Purchaser Parent shall
deliver a number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock equal to the
Indemnity Escrow Amount divided by the Average Share Price (such shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends, distributions,
earnings or other amounts accrued thereon, the "Escrowed Shares") to the
Indemnity Escrow Agent to be held in an escrow account ("Indemnity Escrow
Account") and disbursed as provided in this Section 11.5 and the terms of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

(b) Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this Article 11, any
amounts due by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this Article 11 shall be first
satisfied from the Escrowed Shares. To the extent that Purchaser is determined
to be owed by Seller amounts in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
Purchaser may seek payment for such amounts from Seller.

(c) If Seller does not dispute any claim made by Purchaser against Seller, at
Purchaser's written election, Seller and Purchaser shall provide written
instructions to the Indemnity Escrow Agent in accordance with the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement to disburse to Purchaser a number of Escrowed Shares equal to
the amount of the undisputed claim divided by the Average Share Price. If
Seller does dispute any claim made by Purchaser, then upon the final non-
appealable determination of the amount in question (or a settlement between
the applicable parties), as applicable, with respect to such claim, at
Purchaser's written election, Seller and Purchaser shall provide written
instructions to the Indemnity Escrow Agent to disburse to Purchaser a number
of Escrowed Shares equal to the amount determined by such final, non-
appealable determination or settlement to be due pursuant to the terms of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement divided by the Average Share Price.

(d) On the date that is two (2) Business Days after the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Indemnity Escrow
Agent to release to Seller the then-remaining Escrowed Shares, save and except
a number of Escrowed Shares equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the
aggregate amount of all unsatisfied claims for indemnification that Purchaser
has validly made against Seller on or before such date pursuant to this
Article 11 and which are subject to satisfaction (in whole or in part) from
the Escrowed Shares, divided by the Average Share Price.

(e) The Parties agree to provide joint written instructions to the Indemnity
Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrowed Shares as and when provided in this
Agreement.

Section 11.6 Recording. As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall
record, at Purchaser's expense, the Conveyances in the appropriate counties as
well as the appropriate governmental agencies and provide Seller with copies
of all recorded or approved instruments. 

Section 11.7 Waiver of Trade Practices Acts.

(a) IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES THAT THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PURCHASER PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND WITH RESPECT TO ALL
ACTS OR PRACTICES OF SELLER, PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
TRANSACTION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY LEGAL PRINCIPLES OTHER THAN THE TEXAS

MIGHT BE IMPOSED BY THE DTPA, WHETHER SUCH DUTIES, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ARE
APPLIED DIRECTLY BY THE DTPA ITSELF OR INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER

AGREEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS USE AND NOT FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY, AND

WITH SELLER.

(b) THE PURCHASER PARTIES EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRICE FOR WHICH SELLER
HAS AGREED TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PREDICATED
UPON THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE DTPA AND THIS WAIVER OF THE DTPA. THE
PURCHASER PARTIES FURTHER RECOGNIZE THAT SELLER, IN DETERMINING TO PROCEED
WITH THE ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT, HAS EXPRESSLY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER

services, registration, capital, documentary, stamp, transfer or similar Taxes
will be incurred or imposed upon, or with respect to, the purchase and sale of
the Assets pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). To the

names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 12.6 Replacement of Asset Bonds. The Parties understand that none of
the Asset Bonds are to be transferred to Purchaser. On or before Closing,
Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser, the
corresponding Asset Bonds as necessary to permit the cancellation or
proportionate adjustment thereof, as applicable, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser may also provide
evidence that such new Asset Bonds are not necessary as a result of existing

Asset Bonds are adequate to secure the release of or proportionately adjust,
as applicable, those posted by Seller and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

Texas.

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, HOUSTON DIVISION (OR, IF
JURISDICTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, HOUSTON DIVISION, THEN EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE
COURTS LOCATED IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS). THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST
ANOTHER IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN

SECTION.

Section 12.9 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only
and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 12.10 Amendment; Waivers. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver under this Agreement, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom
enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any
such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the Party
granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by
either of the Parties of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions
of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege under this Agreement,
shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar
nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges under
this Agreement.

Section 12.11 Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8(e), no
Party shall assign all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party
assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior
written consent of the other Party and any assignment or delegation made
without such consent shall be void and of no effect; provided, that Purchaser
may assign its rights hereunder to receive conveyance of any or all of the
Assets (and its rights hereunder that are associated with the Assets so
assigned) to one or more Affiliates of Purchaser in connection with Closing
without Seller's consent; provided further, that in the event of such an
assignment, Purchaser shall not be relieved of any of its obligations under
this Agreement and such assignee shall assume joint and several liability for
all obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of, and be binding on and enforceable by and against, the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a Party from selling
or disposing of an interest in the Assets after the Closing to another Person;
provided that such sale or disposition shall not relieve the selling or
disposing Party of any condition, covenant or obligation under this Agreement
or other Transaction Document. Purchaser acknowledges that if an obligation
runs with the land it may burden the Assets but there shall be no requirement
for Purchaser to have any transferee assume any such obligations. 

Section 12.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits and Schedules attached
hereto, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and

whether oral or written, between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof. In the event of a conflict between the Confidentiality Agreement and
this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

Section 12.13 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than the Purchaser Parties and Seller to any claims,
cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly
provided to the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees.

Section 12.14 Public Announcements. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no
press release or other public announcement, or public statement or comment in
response to any inquiry, or other disclosure that is reasonably expected to
result in a press release or public announcement, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be issued or made by Seller or the Purchaser
Parties, or their respective Affiliates, without the joint written approval of
Seller and the Purchaser Parties, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that, a press release or other
public announcement, or public statement or comment in response to any
inquiry, made without such approval shall not be in violation of this Section
if it is made in order for the disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates to
comply with applicable Laws or stock exchange rules or regulations and
provided (a) it is limited to those disclosures that are required to so comply
and (b) the disclosing Party provides the other Party with prior written
notice of the disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to provide comments
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 12.14 shall not restrict
any Party from recording the Conveyances delivered at Closing, making
disclosures that are required pursuant to Contracts, Leases or Surface Rights,
or from complying with any disclosure requirements of Governmental Bodies that
are applicable to or triggered by the transfer of the Assets or of the
operation thereof. Notwithstanding the Confidentiality Agreement and anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser Parties shall be permitted to
make such press releases, filings, presentations, disclosures or announcements
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement as they deem reasonably
necessary in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the financing of such transactions
(including disclosures made in any roadshow or investor presentation materials
prepared in connection with such financing); provided that the Purchaser
Parties shall provide Seller with a copy of any such press release, filing,
presentation, disclosure or announcement prior to its release and accept
reasonable comments provided by Seller in a timely manner.

Section 12.15 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future Laws effective
during the term hereof, such provision shall be fully severable; this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be effected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance from this Agreement.
