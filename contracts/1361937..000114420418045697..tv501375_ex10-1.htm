federal, state, local, or foreign Law shall be deemed to also refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise, and reference herein to any agreement, instrument, or Law means
such agreement, instrument, or Law as from time to time amended, modified, or
supplemented, including, in the case of agreements or instruments, by waiver
or consent and, in the case of Laws, by succession of comparable successor
Laws. If any period of days referred to in this Agreement shall end on a day
that is not a Business Day, then the expiration of such period shall
automatically be extended until the end of the first succeeding Business Day.

assigns.

participate in all joint interest audits and other audits of
Property Expenses for which such Party is entirely or in part responsible
under the terms of this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

2.4 _Procedures_. For purposes of allocating production (and
accounts receivable with respect thereto) under _Section 2.3_, (a)
liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Assets when they pass through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting

storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters
at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are
transported from the field, and (b) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to
be "from or attributable to" the Assets when they pass through the delivery
point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are transported.
Likewise, as used herein, the terms "earned" and "incurred" shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum
Accountants Society standards.

  



  

Article III 
 CONSIDERATION

  



  

3.1 _Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The aggregate consideration for the Membership Interests shall
consist of (i) an amount in cash equal to $135,000,000 (the
"Cash Consideration") and (ii) 4,200,000 shares of newly-issued PubCo Class A
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration" and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the "Consideration"), as adjusted in accordance with this
Agreement (the "Adjusted Consideration"); _provided_ that all such
adjustments at or following Closing shall be made solely by adjusting the
Cash Consideration.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, PubCo shall contribute and issue, as applicable,
the Stock Consideration to Company. Any shares issued as part of the Stock
Consideration shall be made via book entry issuance bearing customary legends

Securities Act.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares
of PubCo Class A Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or
other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Transactions. Any
such fractional share of PubCo Class A Common Stock shall be cancelled, and
such holder thereof shall not be entitled to any additional consideration in
exchange for such fractional share of PubCo Class A Common Stock. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any such fractional shares of PubCo Class A Common
Stock have no fair value for purposes of Section 155 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.2 _Adjustments to Consideration_. All adjustments to the
Consideration shall be (x) made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in
accordance with GAAP, (y) made without duplication (in this Agreement or

Agreement as of the date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement
Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used to determine such

proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement together with the
explanation therefor and the supporting documents thereof. The Parties shall
in good faith attempt to agree in writing on the Preliminary Settlement
Statement as soon as possible after Contributor's receipt of Company's written
report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon in writing by
the Parties, will be used to adjust the Consideration at Closing; _provided _
that if the Parties do not agree in writing upon any or all of the adjustments
set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such
un-agreed adjustment or adjustments used to adjust the Consideration at

3.4 _Remittance of Cash; Final Settlement Statement_.

  



  

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") will be
prepared by Contributor and delivered to Company taking into account all final
adjustments made to the Consideration and showing the resulting final
Consideration (the "Final Consideration"). The Final Settlement Statement
shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts required by this
Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days
after Company's receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Company shall
return to Contributor a written report containing any proposed changes to the
Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the
reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Contributor shall make available to
Company such information and records of Contributor to the extent reasonably
necessary for Company to verify and audit the adjustments set forth (or that
should have been set forth) in Contributor's draft Final Settlement
Statement. Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed
waived, and Contributor's determinations with respect to all such elements of
the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the
Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Company fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Contributor containing changes Company proposes to be made to the
Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by
Contributor will be deemed to be correct and will, without limiting payments
made from one Party to the other in respect of Asset Taxes pursuant to
_Section 13.2(d)_ or the Parties' respective rights to indemnity under
_Article XI_, be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further
audit or arbitration. If the Final Consideration set forth in the Final
Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon in writing by Contributor and
Company, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Consideration, shall,
without limiting payments made from one Party to the other in respect of Asset
Taxes pursuant to _Section 13.2(d)_ or the Parties' respective rights to
indemnity under _Article XI_, be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to further audit or arbitration. Any difference in the Adjusted
Consideration as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement
Statement and the Final Consideration shall be paid in cash by the owing Party
within ten (10) Business Days after final determination of such owed amounts
in accordance herewith to the owed Party. All amounts paid pursuant to this
_Section 3.4_ shall be delivered in United States currency by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
relevant Party.

  



  

(b) If, after the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.4(a)_, either Party receives monies
(including proceeds of production) belonging to the other Party pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ or otherwise, then such monies shall, within five (5) Business
Days after the end of the month in which they were received, be paid over by
the receiving Party to the owed Party.

  



  

3.5 _Disputes_. Contributor and Company shall work together in good
faith to resolve any matters addressed in the Dispute Notice. If
Contributor and Company are unable to resolve all of the matters addressed in
the Dispute Notice within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of such
Dispute Notice by Company to Contributor, either Party may, upon notice to the
other Party, submit all unresolved matters addressed in the Dispute Notice to
arbitration in accordance with this _Section 3.5_. Within ten (10) Business
Days of a matter being submitted to arbitration by a Party in accordance with
the preceding sentence, each of Company and Contributor shall (a) summarize
their position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty
(20) pages or less and (b) submit such summaries to a nationally-recognized
independent accounting firm as selected by mutual agreement of the Parties
(the  "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final
Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to
submit. If the Parties cannot agree on an Accounting Arbitrator within ten
(10) Business Days after a Party's election to submit such matters to
arbitration under this _Section 3.5_, then either such Party may request the
Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") (or,
if there is no such office, the office of the AAA serving Houston, Texas) to
select the Accounting Arbitrator. Within ten (10) Business Days after
receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision choosing either Contributor's position or Company's
position with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on
the materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting
Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the
Parties and enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally
between Contributor, on the one hand, and PubCo and Company, on the other
hand.

3.6 _Allocated Values_. The Parties agree that the Consideration
shall be allocated among the Assets as set forth on _Exhibit A_  and _Exhibit
B_ (the "Allocated Values"). The Parties agree that such allocation is
reasonable and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.
Contributor, however, make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
such values.

  



  

3.7 _Tax Treatment and Consideration Allocation_.

  



  

(a) For U.S. federal income and any applicable state and local tax
purposes, the Parties agree to treat the transfer of the Membership Interests
by Contributor to Company as a taxable sale of the Assets by Contributor to
Company for PubCo Class A Common Stock and Cash Consideration (and the
assumption of any related Assumed Obligations).

  



  

(b) The Parties shall file all income Tax Returns consistent with
the tax treatment characterization described in _Section 3.7(a)_, and no
Party hereto shall take any position inconsistent with such tax treatment
characterization unless otherwise required by a final "determination" (as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code).

  



  

(c) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree
to an allocation of the Adjusted Consideration and any other items
properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among
the Assets in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the extent
allowed under applicable federal income Tax Law, in a manner consistent with
the Allocated Values, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Final
Settlement Statement is finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.4_ (or if
applicable, _Section 3.5_). If the Parties do not reach an agreement with
respect to such an allocation, the Parties shall submit any such remaining
disputed items to an Independent Accounting Firm who shall act as an
arbitrator to determine only those items in dispute. Within thirty (30) days
following submission to the Independent Accounting Firm, the Independent
Accounting Firm will prepare and deliver a written determination to the
Parties with respect to the allocation. The allocation agreed to by the
Parties or determined by the Independent Accounting Firm shall become the
final allocation (the "Allocation"). The parties (i) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code following any adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement, and (ii) shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, report consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns
and no Party shall take any position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent
with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that no Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise, and/or settle
any Tax audit, claim or similar proceeding in connection with such
allocation.

reorganization or receivership proceedings pending against, being contemplated
by or, to Contributor's Knowledge, threatened in writing against Contributor,

enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers,
in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of
ownership of the Lock-Up Securities, whether any such swap or transaction is
to be settled by delivery of PubCo Class A Common Stock, PubCo Class B Common
Stock, any membership interests in Company or other securities, in cash or
otherwise, or (iii) distribute Lock-Up Securities to any Person, including
affiliates, members, managers, limited or general partners, stockholders or

6.5 _Registration Rights._ (a) Within ninety (90) calendar
days after Closing (the " _Filing Date_ "), PubCo will file with the SEC (at
PubCo's sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the
resale of the Stock Consideration (the " _Registration Statement_ "), and
PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof,
but no later than the 180th calendar day following the Closing (the "
_Effectiveness Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , PubCo's obligations to
include Stock Consideration in the Registration Statement are contingent upon
Contributor furnishing in writing to PubCo such information regarding
Contributor, the securities of PubCo held by Contributor and the intended
method of disposition of the Stock Consideration as shall be reasonably
requested by PubCo to effect the registration of the Stock Consideration, and
Contributor shall execute such documents in connection with such registration
as PubCo may reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder
in similar situations, including providing that PubCo shall be entitled
to postpone and suspend the effectiveness or use of the Registration
Statement during any customary blackout or similar period or as permitted
hereunder. For purposes of clarification, any failure by PubCo to file the
Registration Statement by the Filing Date or to effect such Registration
Statement by the Effectiveness Date shall not otherwise relieve PubCo of its
obligations to file or effect the Registration Statement as set forth above
in this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

(b) In the case of the registration, qualification, exemption or
compliance effected by PubCo pursuant to this Agreement, PubCo shall, upon
reasonable request, inform Contributor as to the status of such registration,
qualification, exemption and compliance. At its expense PubCo shall:

  



    

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) except for such times as PubCo is permitted hereunder to suspend
the use of the prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration, and any
qualification, exemption or compliance under state securities laws which
PubCo determines to obtain, continuously effective with respect to
Contributor, and to keep the applicable Registration Statement or any
subsequent shelf registration statement free of any material misstatements or
omissions, until the earlier of the following: (x) Contributor ceases to hold
any Stock Consideration or (y) the date all Stock Consideration held by
Contributor may be sold without restriction under Rule 144, including any
volume and manner of sale restrictions which may be applicable to affiliates
under Rule 144, and (iii) two (2) years from the Effectiveness Date of the
Registration Statement. The period of time during which the Issuer is
required hereunder to keep a Registration Statement effective is referred to
herein as the " _Registration Period_ ";

  



  

(ii) advise Contributor within five (5) Business Days:

  



  

(1) when a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been
filed with the SEC and when such Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto has become effective;

  



  

(2) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to any
Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for
additional information;

  



  

(3) of the issuance by SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for such purpose;

  



  

(4) of the receipt by PubCo of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Stock Consideration included therein
for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; and

  



  

(5) subject to the provisions in this Agreement, of the occurrence of
any event that requires the making of any changes in any
Registration Statement or prospectus so that, as of such date, the statements
therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading;

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, PubCo shall not,
when so advising Contributor of such events, provide Contributor with any
material, nonpublic information regarding PubCo other than to the extent that
providing notice to Contributor of the occurrence of the events listed in (1)
through (5) above constitutes material, nonpublic information regarding
PubCo;

  



    

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal
of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as
soon as reasonably practicable;

  



  

(iv) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated above, except for
such times as PubCo is permitted hereunder to suspend, and has suspended, the
use of a prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, PubCo shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable
prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a
supplement to the related prospectus, or file any other required document so
that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Stock Consideration
included therein, such prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;

  



  

(v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Stock
Consideration to be listed on each securities exchange or market, if any, on
which the Class A Shares issued by PubCo have been listed; and

  



  

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps
necessary to effect the registration of the Stock Consideration
contemplated hereby and to enable Contributor to sell the Stock Consideration
under Rule 144.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
PubCo shall be entitled to delay or postpone the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and from time to time to require Contributor not to
sell under the Registration Statement or to suspend the
effectiveness thereof, if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by
PubCo or its subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which
negotiation, consummation or event PubCo's board of directors reasonably
believes, upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional
disclosure by PubCo in the Registration Statement of material information that
PubCo has a bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-
disclosure of which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in the
reasonable determination of PubCo's board of directors, upon the advice of
legal counsel, to cause the Registration Statement to fail to comply with
applicable disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension
Event_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that PubCo may not delay or suspend the
Registration Statement on more than two occasions or for more than sixty (60)
consecutive calendar days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar days, in
each case during any twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any written notice
from PubCo of the happening of any Suspension Event during the period that the
Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event
the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the prospectus)
not misleading, Contributor agrees that (i) it will immediately discontinue
offers and sales of the Stock Consideration under the Registration Statement
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144)
until Contributor receives copies of a supplemental or amended
prospectus (which PubCo agrees to promptly prepare) that corrects the
misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any
post-effective amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by
the Issuer that it may resume such offers and sales, and (ii) it will
maintain the confidentiality of any information included in such written
notice delivered by PubCo unless otherwise required by law or subpoena. If so
directed by PubCo, Contributor will deliver to PubCo or, in
Contributor's sole discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering
the Stock Consideration in Contributor's possession; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the prospectus
covering the Stock Consideration shall not apply (i) to the extent
Contributor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (a) in order to
comply with applicable legal, regulatory, self-regulatory or professional
requirements or (b) in accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document
retention policy or (ii) to copies stored electronically on archival servers
as a result of automatic data back-up.

  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Contributor may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-Out Notice_ ")
to PubCo requesting that Contributor not receive notices from PubCo otherwise
required by this _Section 6.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Contributor may
later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-
Out Notice from Contributor (unless subsequently revoked), (i) PubCo shall
not deliver any such notices to Contributor and Contributor shall no longer be
entitled to the rights associated with any such notice and (ii) each time
prior to Contributor's intended use of an effective Registration Statement,
Contributor will notify PubCo in writing at least two (2) Business Days in
advance of such intended use, and if a notice of a Suspension Event
was previously delivered (or would have been delivered but for the provisions
of this _Section 6.5(d)_ and the related suspension period remains in effect,
PubCo will so notify Contributor, within one (1) Business Day of Contributor's
notification to PubCo, by delivering to Contributor a copy of such previous
notice of Suspension Event, and thereafter will provide Contributor with the
related notice of the conclusion of such Suspension Event immediately upon its
availability.

  



  

6.6 _NYSE Listing_. Prior to the Closing, PubCo has filed a notice
of listing of additional shares with The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "
_NYSE_ ") with respect to the Stock Consideration and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such shares of PubCo Class A Common Stock to be listed
and admitted to trading on the NYSE.

  



  

6.7 _Financial Statements_. In order to comply with any current or
future financial statement requirements concerning the Assets for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any registration statement filed
with the SEC under the Securities Act or current or periodic report filed
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, in each case to the extent the
foregoing are to be filed with the SEC by PubCo, its Affiliates, or their
respective successors and assigns, (collectively, "SEC Filings"):

  



  

(a) At PubCo's request, and for up to two (2) years after the
Closing Date, Contributor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their officers and employees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare financial statements, which may include either full financial
statements or abbreviated statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses, relating to the Assets ("Financial Statements"). The Financial
Statements shall be in such form that such Financial Statements and the notes
thereto can be audited (in the case of annual financial statements) or
reviewed (in the case of interim financial statements) by
Contributor's independent auditor ("Contributor's Auditor"), to the extent
required to be included in any SEC Filing pursuant to the Securities Act and
the rules set forth in Regulation S-X (including required supplemental oil and
gas disclosures required under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 932),
and the rules and regulations thereunder, or the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, or to be filed with, or provided to, any other
Governmental Authority or pursuant to any other Law or in connection with any
direct or indirect equity investment in, public or private placement of, or
debt financing of, PubCo or its Affiliates. The Parties understand that such
financial statements may cover periods and dates for up to the most
recent three fiscal years of Contributor (or the Assets, as the case may be)
ending prior to the Closing Date, together with any related unaudited
quarterly or interim period financial statements meeting the requirements of
Regulation S-X (and applicable interpretations, comments and policies of the
SEC Staff) as each may be required in connection with any SEC Filing made by
PubCo, its Affiliates, or their respective successors and assigns;

  



    

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If requested by Contributor's Auditor in connection with the
audit of the Financial Statements or its review of unaudited quarterly or
interim Financial Statements, Contributor shall execute and deliver to
Contributor's Auditor such representation letters, in form and substance
customary for representation letters provided to external audit firms by
management of the company whose financial statements are the subject of an
audit or are the subject of a review pursuant to Statement of Auditing
Standards 100 (Interim Financial Information), as may be reasonably requested
by Contributor's Auditor, with respect to the Financial Statements; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that PubCo shall provide customary indemnity for any
officer of Contributor executing and delivering such representation letters
to Contributor's Auditor. Contributor will provide suitable electronic detail
in the form of lease operating statements by property adequately supporting
all statements provided; and

  



  

(c) Promptly upon PubCo's written request within two (2) years after
the Closing Date, Contributor shall request Contributor's Auditor, after
discussing specifications with PubCo and without limited the generality of the
preceding clauses (a) and (b), to (i) perform an audit of the of the
Financial Statements on PubCo's behalf and to issue its opinion with respect
to any such audited Financial Statements, (ii) provide a review of unaudited
quarterly or interim Financial Statements for periods prior to or including
the Closing Date in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards 100
(Interim Financial Information), (iii) provide its written consent for the
use of its audit reports with respect to any audited Financial Statements in
any current or future SEC Filings filed by PubCo and its Affiliates, or their
successors or assigns, and (iv) conduct such other procedures as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate for Contributor's Auditor to provide the
foregoing. Contributor shall reasonably cooperate with Contributor's Auditor
and PubCo in the completion of such audit and delivery of the audited
Financial Statements and the completion of a review and any required
unaudited quarterly or interim Financial Statements to PubCo, its Affiliates
or their respective successors and assigns. In this regard, Contributor shall
make accounting and field records available to Contributor's Auditor and
PubCo during reasonable business hours to complete any such audit and interim
period review. To the extent required by Contributor's Auditor, Contributor
shall provide such reasonable further cooperation, including by providing such
additional management letters of representation, as may be reasonably
requested by Contributor's Auditor or PubCo, in order for Contributor's
Auditor to provide any further written consents to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of any audited Financial Statements in any future
SEC Filings of PubCo, its Affiliates or any of their respective successors and
assigns. PubCo shall bear all fees charged by Contributor's Auditor and any
other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Contributor in
connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section 6.7_.

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) For a period of three years following the Closing Date,
Contributor shall retain, or caused to be retained, all books, records,
information and documents in its or its Affiliates' possession that would
reasonably be expected to be necessary in connection with the preparation and
audit of Financial Statements with respect to Contributor or the Assets.

  



  

6.8 _Assignment_. Prior to the Closing, Contributor shall have
undertaken the actions contemplated by this _Section 6.8_ (and
provide reasonable evidence thereof to the Company), which actions are
collectively referred to as the "Assignment"):

owned subsidiary of Contributor and shall qualify the Acquired Entity to
conduct business in the State of Texas and to own the Assets; and

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Contributor shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the Acquired Entity, and shall have caused the Acquired Entity to
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Contributor, (i) the Asset Assignment, in
sufficient counterparts to facilitate recording in the applicable counties

Acquired Entity and the assumption by the Acquired Entity of the Assumed
Obligations of Contributor relating to the Assets, and (ii) assignments, in
appropriate forms, of federal Leases, state Leases, and Indian Leases
included in the Assets (if any) in sufficient counterparts to
facilitate filing with the applicable Governmental Authority, in each case of
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), in form and substance reasonably approved
by Company.

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) If the reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of
all Casualty Losses that occur between the Execution Date and the Closing is
less than $1,000,000, then at the Closing (x) the Acquired Entity shall assume
all risk and loss associated with such Casualty Losses as an Assumed
Obligation (and Contributor and its Affiliates shall have no Liability for
such Casualty Losses), (y) the Consideration shall not be adjusted downward
as a result of such Casualty Losses and (z) Contributor shall pay to
Company all sums paid to Contributor by Third Parties by reason of any
Casualty Losses insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign,
transfer, and set over to Company or subrogate Company to all of Contributor's
right, title, and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and
other rights, in each case, against Third Parties arising out of such Casualty
Losses insofar as with respect to the Assets.

  



  

(ii) If the reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of
all Casualty Losses that occur between the Execution Date and the Closing
equals or exceeds $1,000,000, then, at or prior to the Closing, Contributor
shall elect to either (x) adjust the Consideration downward by the amount by
which the reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of such
Casualty Losses exceeds $1,000,000 or (y) exclude the affected Asset(s) from
the transaction contemplated hereby and reduce the Consideration by the
Allocated Value of such excluded Assets. In the event this _clause (b)(ii)_
is applicable, Contributor shall retain all sums paid by Third Parties by
reason of such Casualty Losses and all rights in and to any insurance claims,
unpaid awards, and other rights, in each case, against Third Parties arising
out of such Casualty Losses.

  



  

10.5 _Consents to Assign_. With respect to each Consent set forth on
_Schedule 4.6_ , Contributor shall, within a reasonable period of time after
the Execution Date, send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Consent seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and on forms and in substance reasonably acceptable to Company. If prior to
Closing, either Party discovers any Consents that are not set forth on
_Schedule 4.6_ , such Party shall promptly provide written notice to the other
Party of such Consents, whereupon Contributor shall promptly thereafter seek
consent and comply with such Consents in accordance with this _Section 10.5_.

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) If Contributor fail to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would (i) cause the assignment to the Acquired
Entity of the Assets (or portion thereof affected thereby) and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be void or voidable,
(ii) give rise to the right to terminate, or result in the termination of, a
Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof or (iii) be reasonably
likely to result in any material Liabilities that are liquidated in amount to
the Acquired Entity or Company after Closing (a consent satisfying (i), (ii),
or (iii), a "Hard Consent"), then subject to _Article IX_ , (A) the Asset (or
portion thereof) affected by such Hard Consent shall not be conveyed at the
Closing (and shall be withheld from the Assignment contemplated in _Section
6.8_ ), (B) (1) in cases in which such Asset is a Contract, the Contract
shall be held by Contributor for the benefit of Company until the Hard Consent
is satisfied or the Contract has terminated and Company shall pay all amounts
due thereunder, perform all obligations thereunder and indemnify Contributor
against any Liabilities incurred or suffered by Contributor as a consequence
of remaining a party to such Contract until the Hard Consent is satisfied or
the Contract has terminated or (2) in cases in which the Asset subject to such
Hard Consent is a Lease or Well, all other Assets as may be reasonably
necessary to effect the exclusion of the affected Asset due to any uniformity
of interest provisions, unit agreements or other contractual or operational
restrictions on the transfer of such affected Asset shall not be conveyed at
the Closing, (C) the Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
such Asset (or portion thereof) and associated Assets excluded from the
Assets conveyed at Closing via the purchase of the Membership Interests as
provided in this _Section 10.5,_ and (D) Contributor and Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Hard Consent applicable to the
transfer of such Asset following the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay any money or provide
other consideration to any holder of any such Hard Consent in order to obtain
such Hard Consent. In the event that a Hard Consent (with respect to an Asset
excluded pursuant to this _Section 10.5(a)_) that was not obtained prior to
Closing is obtained within one hundred twenty (120) days following Closing,
then Contributor and Company shall effect a Closing pursuant to _Section
9.5_ (and the other terms and conditions herein) with respect to, and
Contributor shall transfer to Company, the Assets (or interests therein)
subject to such Consent and any associated Assets that were excluded from the
Closing as provided in this _Section 10.58_, and Company shall pay or provide
to Contributor an amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of such
Assets (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2_).

  



  

(b) If Contributor fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing that
is not a Hard Consent, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such
un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Contributor to the
Acquired Entity as part of the Assets and Company and PubCo shall have no
claim against, and, provided Contributor has complied with its obligation to
seek such Consent as provided in this _Section 10.5_, Contributor shall have
no Liability to Company or PubCo for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

  



  

(c) Prior to Closing, Contributor and Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no Party shall be required to incur any Liability, pay
any money or provide any other consideration to the holders of any Consent in
order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Company and PubCo
agree to provide Contributor with any information or documentation that may
be reasonably requested by Contributor or the Third Party holder(s) of such
Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

11.7 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification
under _Section 6.1_,  _Section 11.2_, and _Section 11.3_ shall be asserted
and resolved as follows:

  



  

(a) _In General_. For purposes of _Section 6.1_ and this _Article
XI_, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular
Liabilities shall mean the Party having an obligation to indemnify any
Contributor Indemnified Party or PubCo Indemnified Party, as applicable, with
respect to such Liabilities pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or this _Article
XI_, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with particular
Liabilities shall mean the Contributor Indemnified Party or PubCo Indemnified
Party, as applicable, having the right to be indemnified with respect to such
Liabilities by Company or Contributor, as applicable, pursuant to _Section
6.1_ or this _Article XI_.

  



  

(b) _Claims Procedure_. To make a claim for indemnification under
_Section 6.1_, _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, an Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this _Section 11.7_,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third
Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this
_Section 11.7(b)_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under _Section 6.1_, _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_
(as applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend
against the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach and shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(i) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its
receipt of the Claim Notice relating thereto to notify the Indemnified Party
whether it admits or denies its Liability to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during
such thirty (30) day period (or, if earlier, until the Indemnifying Party
admits its Liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim) to file any motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party admits its Liability to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim, and shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
11.7(c)(ii)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (A) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or(B) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity hereunder).

  



  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its Liability against a
Third Party Claim or admits its Liability to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify
against or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to defend against and settle the Third Party Claim at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (if the Indemnifying Party is
determined to have indemnification Liability with respect to such matter),
with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its Liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its Liability to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice to (A) admit in writing its Liability to
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the Liability and if
Liability is so admitted, either (1) consent to such settlement or (2) reject,
in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement or (B) deny Liability.
Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be
deemed to be an election under _subsection (B)_ above.

  



    

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Direct Claims_. In the case of a claim for indemnification not
based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days after its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities
complained of, (ii) admit its Liability for such Liability, or (iii) dispute
the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the
Indemnifying Party shall conclusively be deemed to have denied Liability with
respect to such matter.

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any and all payments required to be
made by the Parties pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be made in United
States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three
(3) Business Days after the date on which such Party becomes obligated to
make such payment pursuant to this Agreement.

EACH OF THE CONTRIBUTOR INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER
ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, REMOTE OR

foregoing, this guarantee is one of payment, not collection, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor to enforce

Contributor or whether Contributor is joined in any such actions. Guarantor
reserves the right to assert defenses which Contributor may assert against
Company or PubCo under this Agreement with respect to payment or performance
of any Contributor Obligation.

(c) Subject to _Section 11.10_ , Guarantor hereby expressly waives,
relinquishes and agrees not to assert or take advantage of (i) any right to

termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the Loss of
any material benefit under, any contract to which Guarantor is a party, other
than any such violation, default or right that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to materially prevent, impede or
delay Guarantor from performing its obligations under this Agreement; and (vi)
it has the financial capacity to pay and perform the Contributor Obligations,
and access to funds necessary for it to fulfill the Contributor Obligations
and that such access will continue for so long as the Contributor Obligations

12.1 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing (by
written notice from the terminating Party to the other Party):

  



  

(a) by Contributor or Company if Closing shall not have occurred on
or before September 28, 2018 (as may be extended in accordance herewith, the
"End Date");

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) by Contributor or Company if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby is enjoined, restrained or otherwise prohibited or
otherwise made illegal, in each case, by the terms of a final, non-appealable
order;

  



  

(c) by Company or Contributor in the event of a breach by the other
Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement that (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ or _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ ,
as applicable, if it was continuing as of the Closing Date and (ii) cannot be
or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days prior to
the End Date and (B) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to
the breaching Party of such breach, the basis for such notice, and the date of
the proposed termination (a "Terminable Breach"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the terminating Party is not then in Terminable Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in this
Agreement; or

  



  

(d) by the mutual prior written consent of Contributor and Company;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this _Section 12.1_ if
such Party (or its Affiliates, as applicable) is in Willful and Material
Breach of this Agreement at the time this Agreement would otherwise be
terminated by such Party.

  



  

12.2 _Effect of Termination._

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
_Section 12.1_ , then this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and the
Parties shall have no Liability or obligation hereunder; _provided_ that the
provisions of _Section 10.2_ , this _Section 12.2_ , _Section 12.3_ ,
_Article I_, and _Article XIII_ (other than _Section 13.2(b) _ through
_Section 13.2(j)_ and _Section 13.16_ , which shall terminate) and such of the
defined terms set forth in Annex I to give context to such Sections shall, in
each case, survive such termination; _provided_ further that, except as
otherwise provided in _Section 12.2(b)_ , no Party shall be relieved or
released from any Liabilities arising out of any Willful and Material Breach
by such Party that gave rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VII_ or  _Article VIII_, as applicable.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 12.12(a)_
above, if Contributor has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 12.1(c)_ , , then Contributor shall have the right, at its sole
discretion and as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate this Agreement
and receive the sum of $18,500,000, as liquidated damages (and not a penalty),
which amount shall be paid no later than two (2) Business Days after any such
notice of termination of this Agreement. It is expressly stipulated by the
Parties that the actual amount of damages resulting from such a termination
would be difficult if not impossible to determine accurately because of the
unique nature of this Agreement, the unique nature of the Assets, the
uncertainties of applicable commodity markets, and differences of opinion
with respect to such matters, and that such liquidated damages are a
reasonable estimate by the Parties of damages incurred by Contributor under
the circumstances.

12.3 _Return of Documentation and Confidentiality._ Upon termination

connection with its due diligence investigation of the Assets, and an officer
of Company shall certify same to Contributor in writing.

  



  

Article XIII

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

13.1 _Annexes, Exhibits, and Schedules _.__ All of the Annexes,
Exhibits, and Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each
Party to this Agreement and its counsel has received a complete set of
Annexes, Exhibits, and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this
Agreement.

  



  

13.2 _Expenses and Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs, and
expenses incurred by Company, PubCo or Contributor in negotiating
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or in consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring the same, including, legal and accounting fees, costs, and expenses.

  



  

(b) (i) Contributor shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
attributable to (x) any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the portion of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) Company shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
attributable to (A) any Tax period beginning at or after the Effective Time
and (B) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations described in
_Section 13.2(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause
(iii)_ , below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are
based upon or related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause (i)_ or _(iii)_ ),
shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such
Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or
other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period
shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based
on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of
days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of _clause (iii)_ of
the preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the
date on which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to Liability for
the particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at
the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant
to _Section 3.2_ or _Section 3.4_, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize
the most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset
Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an
Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or payable by a Party) is ultimately
determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken into
account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 3.4_, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax
that is allocable to such Party under this _Section 13.2_.

  



  

(e) Subject to Company's indemnification rights under _Section
11.2_, Company shall be responsible for paying any Asset Taxes relating to
any Tax period that ends before or includes the Effective Time that become due
and payable after the Closing Date and shall file with the appropriate
Governmental Authority any and all Tax Returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date with respect to such Asset Taxes in a manner consistent with
Contributor's past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

(f) Contributor shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset
Taxes allocated to Contributor pursuant to _Section 13.2(b)_ and _Section
13.2(c)_, and Company shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes
allocated to Company pursuant to _Section 13.2(b)_ and _Section 13.2(c)_.
If a Party or its Affiliate receives a refund of Asset Taxes (the "Recipient
Party") to which the other Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section
13.2(f)_ (the "Entitled Party"), such Recipient Party shall forward to the
Entitled Party the amount of such refund within thirty (30) days after such
refund is received, net of any costs or expenses incurred by such Recipient
Party in procuring such refund.

  



  

(g) All required documentary, filing, and recording fees and
expenses in connection with the filing and recording of the assignments,
conveyances, or other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to
Company shall be borne by Company. To the extent that any sales, use,
transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary,
filing, recordation or similar Taxes are incurred or imposed with respect to
the transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"),
such Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Company. The Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the extent possible under applicable Laws, the
amount of any such Transfer Taxes. Each Party will provide and make available
to each other Party any resale certificates and other exemption certificates
or information reasonably requested by such other Party. Any Tax Returns that
must be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when
due by the Party primarily or customarily responsible under the
applicable local Laws for filing such Tax Returns, and such Party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide drafts of such Tax Returns to
the other Parties least ten (10) days prior to the expected filing date for
such Tax Returns.

  



  

(h) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon another Party's reasonable request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation, or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

(i) Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to Contributor hereunder
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code, under any Tax Law or pursuant to any other applicable Laws
_provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall provide at least ten (10) Business
Days' written notice to Contributor if Company intends to withhold any
amounts under this _Section 13.2(i)_. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid absent such deduction or withholding.

  



  

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Contributor shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all
Income Taxes incurred by or imposed on Contributor with respect to any period
prior to or including the Closing Date, any of its direct or indirect owners
or Affiliates, or any combined, unitary or consolidated group of which any of
the foregoing is or was a member, and no such Taxes shall be taken into
account as adjustments to the Consideration under _Section 3.2_.

  



  

13.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in
part, by a Party without prior written consent of the other Parties. In

assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder, including
obligations and responsibilities arising following such assignment.

  



  

13.4 _Preparation of Agreement_. Each Party and its counsel
participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

  



  

13.5 _Confidentiality_. Each Party shall keep confidential, and cause
its Affiliates and instruct its representatives, consultants and advisors
to keep confidential, all terms and provisions of this Agreement, except (a)
as required by applicable Laws or any standards or rules of any stock
exchange to which such Party or any of its Affiliates is subject, (b) for
information that is available to the public on the Execution Date, or
thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach
of this _Section 13.5_ , (c) to the extent required to be disclosed in
connection with complying with or obtaining a waiver of any Preferential
Purchase Right or Consent, (d) to any Affiliate or to any representative,
consultant or advisor that is under obligation of confidentiality, (e) in the
case of Company, to any potential purchaser of (or joint venture partner with
respect) to all or any portion of the Assets and any direct and/or indirect
(current or potential) investor or lender, and (f) to the extent that such
Party must disclose the same in any Proceeding brought or threatened by or
against it to enforce or defend its rights under this Agreement; _provided _
that each Party shall consult with the other Party prior to making any such
disclosures pursuant to the foregoing _clause (a)_ or _clause (f)_. This
_Section 13.5_ shall not prevent either Party from recording the assignments
delivered at the Closing or from complying with any disclosure requirements
of Governmental Authorities that are applicable to the transfer of the
Assets. Additionally, from and after the Closing Date, Contributor shall
maintain as confidential, shall not disclose to any Third Party, and shall
not use any of the Records, except as required by Law or as provided in, or
necessary to comply with its obligations under, the Transaction Documents.
This _Section 13.5_ shall not prohibit either Party from issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Parties shall consult
with each other before issuing any such press releases or making any such
public statements.

ACQUIRED, OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE, ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF

13.14 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

  



  

13.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by
facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original

Parties have executed counterparts of this Agreement.

  



  

13.16 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby are special, unique, and of extraordinary character and that, if any
Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made
by it herein, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at
Law. If any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made by such Party herein to be performed, including any obligation
to consummate the Closing, the non-breaching Party, subject to the terms
hereof and in addition to any remedy at Law for damages or other relief
permitted under this Agreement, may institute and prosecute an action in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such
covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief, without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting of a bond. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 13.16_ shall entitle Contributor to seek
specific performance of any obligation or covenant of Company prior to or at
the Closing.

  



  

13.17 _Time is of the Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of
dates and times by which performance or exercise of rights is due, and the
Parties intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and
final date and time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and
relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to
meet any performance or rights election date and time applicable to it on the
basis that its late action constitutes substantial performance. Without
limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement.
