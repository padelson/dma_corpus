"Target Working Capital Calculation") (and in the event of any conflict
between the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing the
March Balance Sheet as compared to the Target Working Capital Calculation,
the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing the Target
Working Capital Calculation shall govern); _provided_  that uncleared checks
outstanding as of Closing shall be reclassified to "Accounts Payable-Trade".

  

#### (iii) "Closing Date Liabilities" shall mean the amount of the

consistent with the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing

Capital Calculation, the accounting practices and methodologies used in
preparing the Target Working Capital Calculation shall govern); _provided_
 that (A) no amounts shall be included in the Closing Date Working Capital
(and no amounts are included in the Target Working Capital) in respect
of liabilities retained by Seller, including the expenses of brokers,
accountants and other advisers retained by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) uncleared checks outstanding as of
Closing shall be reclassified to "Accounts Payable-Trade".

  

#### (iv) "Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities" shall mean the
amount of the liabilities of the Company Group as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern
Time) on the Closing Date under the caption "Miscellaneous Current
Liabilities" as determined in a manner consistent with the accounting
practices used in preparing the March Balance Sheet and the Target Working
Capital Calculation (and in the event of any conflict

        

#### between the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing the
March Balance Sheet as compared to the Target Working Capital
Calculation, the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing the
Target Working Capital Calculation shall govern).

  

#### (v) Any payments owed to Minority Stockholders (as such term is defined
in the Automotive.com, Inc. Stockholders Agreement, dated as of November 15,
2005 (the "Automotive.com Stockholders Agreement")) of Automotive.com Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Automotive.com"), pursuant to Section 3.1 of the
Automotive.com Stockholders Agreement or Section 2.02 of the Automotive.com
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 15, 2005 (the "Automotive.com

### (b) _Delivery of Closing Date Statement_.

  

#### (i) No later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a balance sheet reflecting the financial
condition of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date and
a calculation of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital and (ii) the Closing
Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities (the "Closing Date Statement").  The
Closing Date Statement shall be prepared in the same manner and on
a consistent basis (including the basis of calculation of individual line
items and the determination of allowances and reserves) with the March
Balance Sheet and the Target Working Capital Calculation (and in the event of
any conflict between the accounting practices and methodologies used in
preparing the March Balance Sheet as compared to the Target Working Capital
Calculation, the accounting practices and methodologies used in preparing the
Target Working Capital Calculation shall govern).

  

#### (ii) Seller shall have forty-five (45) days from its receipt of such
Closing Date Statement to notify Purchaser of any objections to any item or
items on the Closing Date Statement. Any such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the item or items in dispute and the amount of any
such dispute (a "Disputed Item" or "Disputed Items"). Any Disputed Item shall
be resolved in the manner set forth in Section 1.03(c) below.  Any items
that are not disputed in accordance with the foregoing shall be deemed
accepted by Seller and shall be final and binding. Purchaser shall cause the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective employees to provide
Seller with reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel,
property, books and records of the Company Group Business for purposes of
permitting the timely and accurate review of the Closing Date Statement.

  

#### (iii) If (A) Seller does not deliver to Purchaser its objections in
writing to the Closing Date Statement within forty-five (45) days of its
receipt of such statement, (B) Seller acknowledges in writing that the
Closing Date Statement is accurate or (C)

        

#### Purchaser and Seller resolve all Disputed Items in accordance
with Section 1.03(c) below, then the Closing Date Statement shall be final,
binding and conclusive on all parties.

  

### (c) _Negotiation; Arbitration_. If Seller notifies Purchaser of any
Disputed Items in accordance with Section 1.03(b)(ii) above, Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate with each other and negotiate in good faith to resolve
any Disputed Items during the period of thirty (30) days following the date
on which Seller provides Purchaser notice that a dispute exists (the
"Negotiation Period"). If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any
Disputed Items during the Negotiation Period, then Sellers independent
accounting representative, Deloitte and Touche ("DandT"), and Ernst and Young LLP
("EandY"), Purchasers independent accounting representative shall endeavor in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Item(s). In the event that DandT and EandY
are unable to resolve the Disputed Item(s) within thirty (30) days, Seller
and Purchaser shall together, within ten (10) business days thereafter,
appoint a representative from an independent, internationally-recognized
accounting firm (other than DandT or EandY) that has not done more than a _de
minimis_  amount of work for the submitting party within the preceding two
(2) years to arbitrate the dispute (the "Arbitrator").  Seller and Purchaser
shall, within the next twenty (20) days thereafter, present their positions
with respect to the Disputed Item(s) to the Arbitrator together with such
other materials as the Arbitrator deems appropriate. The Arbitrator shall,
after the submission of the evidentiary materials, submit its written
decision on each Disputed Item to Seller and Purchaser. In resolving
any Disputed Item, the Arbitrator may not assign a value to any particular
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by Purchaser or
Seller or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Purchaser or
Seller, in each case as presented to the Arbitrator.  Any determination by
the Arbitrator with respect to any Disputed Item shall be final, binding and
conclusive on each party to this Agreement. Except as specifically set forth
to the contrary in this Section 1.03(c) or specifically agreed to by the
parties in writing, the Arbitrator shall comply with, and the arbitration
shall be conducted in New York, New York in accordance with, the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as in
effect for commercial arbitrations conducted in Manhattan by the AAA. Seller
and Purchaser agree that the cost of the Arbitrator shall be borne one-half
(½) by Seller and one-half (½) by Purchaser.

  

### (d) _Effect of Deficiency/Excess_.

  

#### (i) "Deficiency" shall mean the amount, if any, by which the Closing
Date Working Capital as set forth on the Closing Date Statement as modified
as a result of the final resolution of any Disputed Items is less than (
_i.e._ , more negative than) $(16,191,000) (the "Target Working Capital").

  

#### (ii) "Excess" shall mean the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date
Working Capital as set forth on the Closing Date Statement as modified as a
result of the final resolution of any Disputed Items is greater than ( _i.e._
, less negative than) the Target Working Capital; provided that, for purposes
of Section 1.03(d)(iii), 1.03(e) and 1.03(f), the amount of the Excess shall
not exceed an amount equal to $3,000,000.

  

#### (iii) The Base Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of the Deficiency, if any, or increased dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of the

        

#### Excess, if any. In addition, the Base Purchase Price, as so adjusted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, shall be subject to an
additional adjustment whereby it shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by
which the Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities set forth on the
Closing Date Statement, as modified as a result of the final resolution of
any Disputed Items, is greater than $27,232,000 (such excess amount, the
"Additional Miscellaneous Current Liabilities Amount").

  

### (e) _Resolution of Deficiency/Excess_. If it is finally determined
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.03 that there is a Deficiency or
an Additional Miscellaneous Current Liabilities Amount, then within ten (10)
days after all Disputed Items with respect thereto have been resolved, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such Deficiency and/or Additional
Miscellaneous Current Liabilities Amount. If it is finally determined pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 1.03 that there is an Excess, after taking
into account any Additional Miscellaneous Current Liabilities Amount which
may apply, then within ten (10) days after all Disputed Items with respect
thereto have been resolved, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such
Excess.

  

### (f) _Payment_. All amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.03(e) above, if
any, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
within ten (10) days after the final determination thereof and shall
be accompanied by a payment of simple interest thereon calculated at the
annual rate of 3% (assuming a 360 day year) from the Closing Date to the
actual date of payment.

  

### (g) After the final determination of the Closing Date Working Capital and
Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities pursuant to this Section 1.03,
no party shall have the right to make any claims against any other party
hereto in respect of any element of the Closing Date Working Capital and
Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities that such party raised, or
could have raised, in the process for finally determining the Closing Date
Working Capital and Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities set forth
in this Section 1.03; provided that this Section 1.03(g) shall not be deemed
to limit the parties respective rights to indemnification for breach of this
Agreement under Article VII hereof or indemnification under Article VIII
hereof.

mailing. Each of Parent and Seller has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and has, or at Closing will have, duly executed and delivered the
Additional Agreements to which it is a party, and this Agreement constitutes,
and each Additional Agreement to which it is a party constitutes, or at
Closing will constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and
by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.

  

## SECTION 3.05. _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.05, assuming compliance with the notification requirements of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act") and ****
the applicable requirements of antitrust or other competition laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States or investment laws relating to
foreign ownership (collectively, "Foreign Antitrust Laws"), neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the Additional
Agreements to which it is a party, nor the consummation by Parent or Seller
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Parent
or Seller with the terms and provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) conflict
with the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or other valid instrument of
creation, formation, or organization ("Formation Documents"), as the case may
be, of any of Parent, Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (ii)
conflict with, or result in the breach or termination of, or constitute a
default (or with notice or lapse of time or both, constitute a default) under
or result in the termination or suspension of, or accelerate the performance
required by the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, license, lease, agreement, commitment or other instrument to which
any of Parent, Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of the foregoing is bound; (iii) constitute a violation by any
of Parent, Seller, the Company or Company Subsidiaries of any law, statute,
judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, rule or regulation of any
court or governmental authority applicable to any of the foregoing, the
Company Shares or the Subsidiary Shares; or (iv) result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the Company Shares or the Subsidiary Shares; except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, defaults,
breaches, terminations, suspensions or acceleration of performance which,
taken as a whole, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

## SECTION 3.06. _No Consents_. No order, permission, consent,
approval, license, authorization, registration, or validation of, or filing

(b) filings required under any Foreign Antitrust Laws solely as a result of
the status, assets or operations of Purchaser or any of its affiliates, and
(c) any order, permission, consent, approval, license, authorization,

obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to (i) prevent, impede or
materially delay Sellers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Additional Agreements

        

## to which it is a party or (ii) result in any material fine or penalty on
Purchaser, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date.

Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws,
rules, regulations, orders and ordinances of any governmental authority, as
such laws apply to the Company and each Company Subsidiary, respectively,

Company, Company Subsidiaries or Seller has received any written notice that
any investigation regarding any violations of applicable laws by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary by a governmental authority of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of any of the Company,
Company Subsidiaries or Seller, threatened. This Section 3.07 does not relate
to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Article VIII.

  

## SECTION 3.08. _Permits_. Except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and each Company Subsidiary possesses all

contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall execute
such documents and other papers and take such further actions as the other
party may reasonably request in order to carry out the provisions hereof and

reasonable commercial efforts following the Closing to obtain such consents
(provided that such obligation shall not require the expenditure of money by
Parent or any of its affiliates other than immaterial expenses incurred in
the ordinary course of obtaining such consents). To the extent that any such
consents are not obtained, and until the impediments to the assignment of any
such contract are resolved, Parent shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts following the Closing (provided that such obligation shall
not require the expenditure of money by Parent or any of its affiliates other
than immaterial expenses incurred in the ordinary course of obtaining such
consents) to provide to the Company, at the request of Purchaser, the
benefits of such contract and cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to

Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to pay, perform and discharge, and
Purchaser shall indemnify Parent and its affiliates against and hold Parent
and its affiliates harmless from, all liabilities and obligations relating to
any such performance or failure to perform by the Company. In the event of a
failure of such indemnity, Parent shall cease to be obligated under this
Agreement in respect of such contract which is the subject of such failure.

        

### (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Seller, with the assistance of Purchaser, shall
prepare, and Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), a preliminary information statement in form and substance

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall cooperate with
Parent and Seller in the preparation of the preliminary information statement
and the definitive Information Statement and shall furnish to Parent and
Seller the information relating to it and its affiliates required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent and
Seller agree to use their reasonable best efforts, after consultation with
Purchaser, to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC and to cause the
Information Statement in definitive form to be mailed to Parents
stockholders at the earliest practicable time. Parent shall notify
Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendments or supplements
to the preliminary information statement or the Information Statement, and
Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and
if required, Parent shall mail to its stockholders, such amendment or
supplement. The Information Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of law.

  

### (c) Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including Seller and
the Company Group) to, assist and reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in
connection with its efforts to enter into definitive financing arrangements,

basis and on reasonable advance notice, to attend due diligence sessions,
meetings, presentations, road shows and sessions with ratings agencies; (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
information and offering memoranda, business projections and financial
statements, to the extent relating to the Company Group; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, prior to the Closing, any private placement memoranda
or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt or equity securities need not
be issued by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and,
provided, further, that any such memoranda or prospectuses which contain
disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall reflect Purchaser and/or its subsidiaries (which
shall only include the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries following
the Closing) as the obligor(s); (iii) issuing customary representation
letters regarding the Company Group to auditors and using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide reasonable
assistance to Purchaser, including requesting such accountants to provide
consent to Purchaser to use their audit reports relating to the Company Group
and to prepare and deliver any customary "comfort letters"; (iv) as promptly
as reasonably practicable, furnishing Purchaser and its debt financing
sources (A) audited combined balance sheets of the Company Group Business for
the two fiscal years, and audited statements of income and cash flows of the
Company Group Business for the three fiscal years, ended before the Closing
Date (in accordance with Regulation S-X and without any qualified audit
opinion thereon) and, to the extent available, unaudited combined balance
sheets and related statements of income and cash flows of the Company Group
Business for each completed fiscal quarter since the date of such audited
financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X (and, to the extent
available, for each completed month since the last such quarter) (the items
in this Section 5.04(c)(iv)(A) being collectively referred to as the
"Required Financial Information") and (B) any other financial
statements, financial data, audit reports and other information relating to
the Company Group of the type required by, and in each case in accordance
with, Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K

        

### under the Securities Act and the other accounting rules and
regulations of the SEC as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser and of the
type and form customarily included in private placement memoranda pursuant to
Rule 144A of the Securities Act; (v) cooperating in satisfying the conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter (to the extent the satisfaction of such
condition requires the cooperation of Parent, Seller and the Company Group);
(vi) promptly providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to
the extent reasonably available and prepared by the Company Group in the
ordinary course of business generally consistent with past practice; (vii)
executing and delivering, as of the Closing Date, any pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other customary and
appropriate certificates or documents contemplated by the Commitment Letter
as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral; provided that no obligation of the
Company Group under any pledge or security document or any other definitive
financing document shall be effective until the Closing Date, subject to the
Closing occurring; and (viii) as of the Closing Date, subject to the Closing
occurring, taking all corporate actions necessary to authorize the
consummation of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter;
_provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of Parent, Seller, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
(1) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any
liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the Financing (or Alternative
Financing), unless and until, solely with respect to the Company Group, the

interfere with the ongoing operations of it or any of its subsidiaries,
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any laws, cause any
of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be breached, cause
any condition to closing in Article VI to fail to be satisfied or otherwise
cause the breach of this Agreement or any other agreement to which it or any
of its subsidiaries is a party.  Parent and Seller will use reasonable best
efforts to periodically update any such Required Information to be included
in an offering document to be used in connection with such financing so that
such required information complies with clause (iv) of the preceding
sentence. Purchaser shall promptly, upon request of Parent, reimburse Parent
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Company Group)
in connection with the cooperation of Parent and its subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 5.04, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and its affiliates and their respective representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing or any information used in connection therewith (except
with respect to any information provided by or on behalf of Parent, Seller or
the Company).

  

### (d) (i) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (B) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser to obtaining the
Financing, (C) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions) and (D) consummate the Financing at
or prior to the Closing (including by taking enforcement actions against
the lenders and other persons providing the Financing to fund such
Financing). Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its

        

### rights under, any Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related
to the Financing, in each case, without Parents prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except any such
amendment, supplement or other modification to the Commitment Letter that
would not involve terms that are materially less beneficial to Purchaser,
would not involve any conditions to funding the Financing that are not
contained in the Commitment Letter and would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood that, subject to the requirements of this sentence, such
amendment, supplement or other modification of the Commitment Letter may
provide for the assignment of a portion of the Financing commitment to
additional agents or arrangers and the granting to such persons of
approval rights as are customarily granted to additional agents or
arrangers). Upon any such amendment, supplement or modification of the
Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)(i), the term
"Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented or modified.

  

#### (ii) In the event all or any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letter for any reason, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, alternative financing from alternative sources (the
" _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would not involve terms
that are materially less beneficial to Purchaser, would not involve any
conditions to funding the Financing that are not contained in the Commitment
Letter and would not be reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Financing or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, in the event that (x) all or any portion of the Financing
structured as high yield financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing
conditions contained in Sections 6.01(a) (excluding conditions that by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing shall have been satisfied or
waived) and (z) Parent has delivered to Purchaser the Required Financial
Information, then Purchaser shall consummate, or cause to be consummated, and
shall use, or cause to be used, the proceeds of the bridge facilities
described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)) to replace such
high yield financing no later than five (5) business days following the date
on which the event in the foregoing clause (y) has occurred.

  

#### (iii) Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt written notice of any
breach by any party of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)) of
which Purchaser becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter (or
commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
Section 5.04(d)).  Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep
Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)) and provide to Seller
copies of all material documents related to the Financing (or Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)), other than any
ancillary agreements subject to confidentiality agreements (except to the
extent such agreements contain any conditions

        

#### to the consummation of the Financing (or Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with this Section 5.04(d)), including any "flex"
provisions).

Seller, the parties shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
their representatives, employees, counsel and accountants access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice, Records
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date, and shall permit such persons
to examine and copy, at such persons sole cost and expense, such Records to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party as is reasonably necessary

avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law that may
be asserted by any governmental antitrust authority or any other party so as
to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated
hereby. For purposes of this Section 5.07, "reasonable best efforts" of
Purchaser shall include promptly (i) opposing any motion or action for a
temporary preliminary or permanent injunction against the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if Purchaser loses such motion or
action for a preliminary or permanent injunction, entering into a consent
decree containing Purchasers agreement to hold separate and divest the
products and assets of the Company Group or Purchaser and its affiliates, as
the case may be, as required by any such government entity; provided that any
such divestitures would not have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets or financial condition of the Company Group, after giving effect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Closing_. Except for matters (x) set forth in Schedule 5.08, (y) consented to

and hold harmless Parent, Seller and their subsidiaries from and against any
and all loss, liability or damage arising out of or relating to its
obligations under such guarantees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the

their subsidiaries contain an option to renew, Purchaser shall not renew such
lease without having Parent, Seller, and/or any of their subsidiaries
released from such guarantee.

Date, Purchaser shall be entitled, through its employees and representatives,
to make such reasonable investigation of the assets, properties, business
and operations of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as Purchaser

the Company Groups good faith determination, compromise the assertion of any
attorney-client privilege. Any such investigation shall be conducted
at reasonable times, on prior notice, and under reasonable circumstances and
shall not include any invasive or destructive environmental sampling or
testing. All information obtained or derived from access pursuant to this
Section 5.13 shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

## SECTION 5.14. _Use of Names_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and Company Subsidiaries, promptly after the Closing Date, and in any

## license to use the Retained Names in connection with the Company Group
Business for the above time period after the Closing Date, solely for
transitional purposes and solely for use in a manner consistent with past
practice, provided that during such time period, such licensees shall take
reasonable actions with respect to using the Retained Names to avoid any
confusion as to Purchasers current ownership. Purchaser shall cause the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to file applications promptly, and in any
event within 90 days after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any
Trademark filings or certificates that contain any Retained Names.  After

to describe the history of the Company Group Business or as required by
applicable law.

or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent

### (a) take any action, or enter into any agreement to take any action, that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Additional Agreements or the ability of Purchaser to obtain the
Financing contemplated herein;

  

### (b) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distributions, whether
or not upon or in respect of any shares of its capital stock, other than
dividends from its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, or

securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its capital
stock;

  

### (c) acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof or otherwise acquire any assets (other than inventory)
which, individually or in the aggregate with respect to all such acquisitions
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, have an enterprise
value in excess of $100,000,000; or

  

### (d) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, or publicly disclose any
intention, to do any of the foregoing.

Company Subsidiaries.

(B) to be so true and correct (disregarding all materiality or Material

their then existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as

jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser and hold Purchaser, Purchasers

shall in all respects be disregarded, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Seller set forth herein to be performed on

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Seller shall have no
liability to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.02
(x) on account of any claim pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.02(a), other
than indemnification with respect to the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.02 (Capitalization and Title to Shares), Section 3.03
(Company Subsidiaries), Section 3.04 (Authorization of Agreement) and Section
3.10 (No Brokers), as to which the Threshold amount set forth in this Section
7.02(b) shall not apply, (1) unless and until and only to the extent that the
liability in respect of such claims, when aggregated with their liability in
respect of all other claims made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.02(a)
amounts to more than $12,500,000 (the "Threshold") and (2) unless such claim

with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.01,
Section 3.02 (Capitalization of the Company and Title to Shares), Section
3.03 (Company Subsidiaries), Section 3.04 (Authorization of Agreement) and
Section 3.10 (No Brokers) as to which such one year period shall not apply,
whereupon Parent and Seller shall be liable to pay amounts due pursuant to
clause (i) of Section 7.02(a) only in excess of the Threshold, (y) for Losses
incurred as a result of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or Losses in connection with any of the matters
described in clause (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 7.02(a) above, in each case,
to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Losses were finally
included as a specific component of the Closing Date Working Capital or
Closing Date Miscellaneous Current Liabilities pursuant to Section 1.03 of
this Agreement or (z) to the extent that any such indemnification would
result in a duplication of recoveries for any matter indemnified pursuant to
Article VIII hereof. For the

        

### avoidance of doubt, the Threshold set forth in this Section 7.02(b) shall
not apply to payment of amounts due pursuant to Section 1.03 of this
Agreement.

  

### (c) The maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Seller for any and all
claims under clause (i) of Section 7.02(a) other than indemnification with
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.02
(Capitalization and Title to Shares), Section 3.03 (Company Subsidiaries),

paid by Seller pursuant to Section 1.03.

  

SECTION 7.03. _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

  

### (a) Purchaser shall indemnify Parent and Seller and hold Parent, Seller,
Parents subsidiaries, Sellers subsidiaries and their respective officers,

in respect of any and all Losses, that arise from or relate or are
attributable to (i) any misrepresentation by Purchaser or breach of a
warranty made by Purchaser, in each case, under Article IV hereof, provided,
however, that if any such representation or warranty is qualified in any
respect by reference to materiality, solely for purposes of this Article VII,
such qualification shall in all respects be disregarded, (ii) any breach of
any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth herein or in any
of Purchasers Additional Agreements to be performed on or prior to Closing,

Employee arising on or after the Closing Date, (vi) any payments owed to

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no liability to
indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties (x) on account of any claim pursuant to
clause (i) of Section 7.03(a), other than indemnification with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.02 (Authorization of
Agreement) and Section 4.06 (No Brokers), as to which the Threshold shall not
apply, (1) unless and until and only to the extent that the liability of
Purchaser in respect of such claims, when aggregated with their liability in
respect of all other claims made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.03(a)
amounts to more than the Threshold and (2) unless such claim is asserted in
writing by the Seller Indemnified Party within one year after the Closing
Date, whereupon Purchaser shall be liable to pay amounts due pursuant to
clause (i) of

        

### Section 7.03(a) only in excess of the Threshold and (y) for any breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that was
finally included in the working capital adjustment provided in Section 1.03
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Threshold set forth in
this Section 7.03(b) shall not apply to payment of amounts due pursuant to
Section 1.03 of this Agreement.

  

### (c) The maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser for any and all claims
under clause (i) of Section 7.03(a) shall not exceed the Cap. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Cap set forth in this Section 7.03(c) shall not apply
to any amounts required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.03.

  

SECTION 7.04. _Notice to the Indemnitor_. Promptly after the assertion of
any claim by a third party (including a governmental entity) which may give
rise to a claim for indemnification from an indemnifying party
("Indemnitor") under this Article VII, an indemnified party ("Indemnitee")
shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such claim. The Indemnitor shall
then have thirty (30) days to advise the Indemnitee whether the Indemnitor
accepts the defense of such claim and the Indemnitor shall have no obligation
to Indemnitee for legal fees incurred by Indemnitee before or after the date
of any assumption of the defense by Indemnitor; provided that, if there
exists a material conflict of interest (other than one that is of a monetary
nature) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled
to retain its own counsel (and the fees and expenses of such
counsel reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee may be considered Losses
subject to indemnification hereunder). The Indemnitor shall not be liable to
the Indemnitee for any claim not presented to the Indemnitor by the
Indemnitee for a defense within thirty (30) days of the claim being presented
in writing to the Indemnitee by the party making the claim to the extent that
the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such delay.  If the Indemnitor
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such third
party claim as provided above, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the
Indemnitor in such defense, including by making available to the Indemnitor,
all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnitees possession or control relating thereto and all
personnel, premises and properties of the Indemnitee relating thereto, in
each case, as is reasonably required by the Indemnitor, and subject to
mutually agreeable customary confidentiality restrictions.  Similarly, in
the event the Indemnitee is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any such third party claim, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the
Indemnitee in such defense, including by making available to the Indemnitee,
all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnitors
possession or control relating thereto and all personnel, premises and
properties of the Indemnitor relating thereto, in each case, as is reasonably
required by the Indemnitee, and subject to mutually agreeable customary
confidentiality restrictions.

  

SECTION 7.05. _Right of Parties to Settle or Defend_. For purposes of
Article VII, if the Indemnitor determines to accept the defense of such claim
(as described in Section 7.04), the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have
acknowledged that such claim is subject to indemnification by the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee shall have the right to be represented by its own counsel
at its own expense, its participation to be subject to reasonable direction
of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee shall provide all requested waivers and
authorities for the Indemnitor to act on behalf of the Company Group. If the
Indemnitor fails to undertake the defense of or settle or pay any such third
party claim within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitee

        

has given written notice to the Indemnitor of the claim, or if the
Indemnitor, after having given such notification to the Indemnitee, fails
within thirty (30) days to defend, settle or pay such claim, then the
Indemnitee may take any and all necessary action to dispose of such claim;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnitee settle such claim
without the prior consent of the Indemnitor as provided in Section 7.06
below.

  

SECTION 7.06. _Settlement Proposals_. (a) In the event the Indemnitee
desires to settle any third-party claim the defense of which has not been
assumed by Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall advise the Indemnitor in writing
of the amount it proposes to pay in settlement thereof (the
"Proposed Settlement"). The Indemnitor shall have ten (10) days after the
Indemnitors receipt of the notice of the Proposed Settlement to advise the
Indemnitee whether it accepts the Proposed Settlement.  If the Indemnitor
notifies the Indemnitee that it accepts the Proposed Settlement, the
Indemnitee may offer the Proposed Settlement to the third party making the
claim. If after approval by the Indemnitor the Proposed Settlement is not
accepted by the party making such claim, any new Proposed Settlement figure
which the Indemnitee may wish to present to the party making such claim shall
again first be presented to the Indemnitor in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7.06.

  

### (b) The Indemnitor may settle such third-party claim that it has agreed
to accept the defense of (pursuant to Section 7.04) on any terms which it may
deem reasonable provided that the Indemnitor shall not without the
Indemnitees prior written consent, (i) settle or compromise such proceeding,
claim or demand, or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release from all liability in
respect of such proceeding, claim or demand or (ii) settle or compromise any
such proceeding, claim or demand, in any manner that would require
limitations on the manner in which the Indemnitee conducts its business.

  

SECTION 7.07. _Reimbursement_. At the time the amount of any liability on the
part of the Indemnitor under this Article VII is determined (which in
the case of payments to third persons shall be the earlier of (i) the date of
such payments or (ii) the date that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
enter a final judgment, order or decree (after exhaustion of appeal
rights) establishing such liability), the Indemnitor shall within thirty (30)
days upon notice from the Indemnitee, pay to the Indemnitee, the amount of
the indemnity claim. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a third
party claim, or has acknowledged that a third party claim the defense of
which has been assumed by the Indemnitee, is subject to indemnification by
the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall reimburse all Losses incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such third party claim for which Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder as and when incurred by the Indemnitee.

  

SECTION 7.08. _Certain Adjustments_. (a) The parties agree that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by applicable law.

  

### (b) The amount of any Losses or Tax for which indemnification is provided
under this Article VII or Article VIII shall be computed net of any insurance
proceeds received by the Indemnitee in connection with such Losses. If the
Indemnitee or any of its affiliates receives insurance proceeds in connection
with Losses for which it has received indemnification,

        

### such party shall refund to the Indemnitor the amount of such insurance
proceeds when received, up to the amount of indemnification received. If the
amount with respect to which any claim is made under Article VIII or this
Article VII (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a currently realizable Tax
Benefit (as defined below) to the party making the claim, the indemnity
payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit available to the
party making the claim, and increased to take account of any net Tax cost
incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed up for such increase). For purposes of this Section 7.08,
a "Tax Benefit" means an amount by which the tax liability of the party (or
group of corporations including the party) is reduced (including, without
limitation, by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax
basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus
any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. For the
purposes of this Section 7.08, a Tax Benefit is "currently realizable" to the
extent it can be reasonably anticipated that such Tax Benefit will be
realized in the current taxable period or year or in any tax return with
respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or
in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Indemnity Claim. In
the event that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit,
the indemnifying party shall be liable to refund to the indemnified party
the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments previously
made to the indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 7.08. The amount of
the refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under this
Section 7.08 and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions or
gross-up under this Section 7.08.

  

SECTION 7.09. _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except to the
extent of non-monetary equitable relief (including specific performance) made
with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be performed following the Closing, the
indemnification obligations of this Article VII and Article VIII shall be the
exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of fraudulent
conduct, the limitations on indemnification (including as to duration and
amount) contained in this Article VII shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification under this Article VII.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII**

Agreement or as required by law, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, neither Parent,
Seller nor the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any affiliate of Seller
shall, change or make any material Tax elections, change any method of
accounting with respect to material Taxes, file any amended material Tax
Return, or settle or compromise any federal, state, local or foreign material
Tax liability relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

### (b) All tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent and
its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on
the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.

  

SECTION 8.03. _Taxable Periods Straddling Closing Date_. (a) Parent,
Purchaser and Seller agree that if the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
permitted but not required under applicable state or local Income Tax laws to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period,
Parent, Purchaser, Seller, the Company or each Company Subsidiary, as the
case may be, shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable period.

  

SECTION 8.04. _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payments of Taxes_.

  

### (a) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, Parent and Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file
or cause to be filed (in a manner consistent with past practices) with the
appropriate taxing authorities all Tax

        

### Returns required to be filed, and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). Purchaser shall have the right
to review such Pre-Closing Tax Returns prior to the filing of such Tax
Returns, other than Tax Returns that are Consolidated or Combined Tax
Returns, and Seller and Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith
any issue arising as a result of the review of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns.

  

### "Consolidated or Combined Tax Return" means any Tax Return that is filed
on a consolidated, combined, or unitary basis and that includes the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller or
its affiliates (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) on the
other hand.

  

### (b) Parent and Seller shall include the income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including any deferred items triggered into income by Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-19) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods in the
consolidated returns of all Parent Groups for all periods through the end of
the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes attributable to such income.

  

### (c) For any taxable period that begins on or before and ends after the
Closing Date ("Straddle Period") of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
Purchaser shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to
be filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns; provided that Parent and Seller shall, not
later than ten (10) business days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns, pay to Purchaser their share of any Taxes due with respect to any
amount owed by them pursuant to Sections 8.08 and 8.09 with respect to the
taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns.

  

### (d) With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for Straddle Periods ("
_Straddle Returns_ "), such Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by law).  Purchaser
shall deliver, at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Straddle Return (including extension), to the Seller a statement setting
forth the amount of Tax allocated to the Seller pursuant to Section 8.09 (the
" _Tax Statement_ ") and copies of such Straddle Return. Seller shall have the
right to review such Straddle Return and the Tax Statement prior to the
filing of such Straddle Return and, within ten days after the date of receipt
by Seller of any Straddle Return, to request in writing any reasonable
changes to such Straddle Return. Seller and Purchaser agree to consult and
resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such
Straddle Return and the Tax Statement and mutually to consent to the filing
as promptly as possible of such Straddle Return. In the event the parties are
unable to resolve any dispute within ten days after Purchaser has received
Sellers written request for changes, then any disputed issues shall be
resolved pursuant to the steps set forth in Section 1.03(c) to resolve in a
final binding matter prior to the due date for such Straddle Return.

  

SECTION 8.05. _Refunds and Carrybacks_

  

### (a) Purchaser shall pay to Seller all refunds or credits of Income Taxes,
and other Taxes received by Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by or on behalf of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor thereof) with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and portion of

        

### Straddle Period allocated to Seller under Section 8.09), except to the
extent that such refund was taken into account in determining the final
Closing Date Working Capital.

  

### (b) Each such payment (which shall include any interest received or
credited with respect to such refund or credit) shall be made to the other
party promptly after receipt of any such refund from, or allowance of such
credit by, the relevant taxing authority. Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary
to cooperate, in obtaining any refund or credit of Taxes available from
the relevant taxing authority.

  

SECTION 8.06. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Parent and Seller, on the other hand, shall join in timely making elections
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Code") (and any corresponding
elections under state, local, or foreign tax law) (collectively the "Section
338(h)(10) Elections") with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of
the Company Shares and each Company Subsidiary, and Purchaser and Parent and
Seller shall cooperate in the completion and timely filing of such elections
in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
law) or any successor provision. Pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, the Purchase
Price (together with applicable liabilities and other relevant items), as
adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as set forth in an
allocation schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"). Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller an initial draft of the Allocation Schedule within 60 days
after the Closing Date.  Seller shall have the right to review the Allocation
Schedule and, within 20 days after the date of receipt by Seller of the
Allocation Schedule, to request in writing any reasonable changes to the
Allocation Schedule. Seller and Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of the Allocation
Schedule. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within
10 days after Purchaser has received Sellers written request for changes,
then any disputed issues shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1.03(c) _mutatis mutandis_.  Consistent with the final binding
Allocation Schedule determined in accordance with this Section 8.06,
Purchaser shall prepare the applicable IRS forms (and any comparable forms
required to be filed under state, local, or foreign tax law). None of Parent,
Seller or Purchaser shall take any position (whether in financial statements,
Tax Returns, tax audits, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such
final Allocation Schedule determined in accordance with this Section 8.06.
Seller will pay any Tax attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election and will indemnify Purchaser, the Company, and its Subsidiaries
against any Losses arising out of any failure to pay such Tax, except to the
extent such Taxes are reflected as an accrued Tax liability on the Closing
Date Statement and have been taken into account in determining the final
Closing Date Working Capital.

  

SECTION 8.07. _Cooperation_. Parent, Seller, the Company Group, and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all
disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to
Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available on
a mutually convenient

        

basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

  

SECTION 8.08. _Tax Indemnification_ (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Seller shall jointly and
severally indemnify Purchaser and hold Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless
against and in respect of:

  

#### (i) any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage for Taxes with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and with respect to any Straddle Period, for the portion thereof
ending on the Closing Date;

  

#### (ii) any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage (as a result
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or otherwise) for Taxes of Parent,
Seller or any person (other than the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser) which is or has ever been affiliated
with the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with whom the Company or any
Company Subsidiary otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
Tax Return; and

  

#### (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing;

  

provided, that (in the case of each of (i), (ii) and (iii) above) no
indemnification will be made to the extent such Taxes were finally included
as a specific component of the Closing Date Working Capital or Closing Date
Miscellaneous Current Liabilities pursuant to Section 1.03 of this Agreement.

  

### (b) Purchaser shall, and after the Closing shall cause the Company and
each Company Subsidiary to, indemnify Seller and each of its respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and
hold them harmless from all liability for Taxes of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date
(except to the extent such taxable period began before the Closing Date, in
which case Purchasers indemnity will cover only that portion of any such
Taxes that are allocable to the period after the Closing Date).

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this Section 8.08 shall terminate at the close of business on the 60th day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof).

  

SECTION 8.09. _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be:

        

### (a) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or,
in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period and

  

### (b) In the case of Taxes not described in (a) above (such as franchise
Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon
occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the
amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

SECTION 8.10. _Tax Claims_.

  

### (a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if
successful, might result in an indemnity payment to an indemnified party
pursuant to Section 8.08, then such indemnified party shall give notice to
the indemnifying party in writing of such claim and of any counterclaim the
indemnified party proposes to assert (a "Tax Claim"); provided, however, the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party has been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

  

### (b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall, solely at its own cost and expense, control all proceedings and
may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole
discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and
may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund
where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in
any permissible manner; provided, however, that Sellers must first consult,
in good faith with Purchaser before taking any action with respect to the
conduct of such Tax Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not
settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Purchaser, and counsel of its
own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if such Tax Claim could have a
material adverse impact on the Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the
Closing Date.

  

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly control and participate in all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, and shall bear
their own respective costs and expenses. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall
settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other,
which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, or delayed.

  

(d) Purchaser shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date. Seller shall have no right to participate in the conduct of any such
proceeding.

        

SECTION 8.11. _Taxes_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Tax" or
"Taxes" means all taxes, charges, fees, levies, or other assessments
imposed by any federal, territorial, state, local or foreign government or
any agency or political subdivision of such government, including all net

TERMINATION

  

SECTION 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned, (a) by mutual
written agreement of the parties hereto, (b) by either party by written
notice to the other party if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or
before the date that is 120 days following the date of this Agreement (the
"Termination Date"), (c) by Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01(a) shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not
have been waived by Purchaser, or (d) by Seller if any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.01(b) shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and
shall not have been waived by Seller; _provided_ , however, that (i) the
party seeking termination pursuant to clauses (c) or (d) is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing has not
occurred by the Termination Date solely as a result of the failure of Parent
to deliver to Purchaser the Required Financial Information, Purchaser may
unilaterally extend the Termination Date by up to 30 days, in which case, the
Termination Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such later date.

  

SECTION 9.02. _Liabilities in Event of Termination_. In the event of any
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01 above,
this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and
effect except for the provisions of Section 5.09 and the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter defined) which shall remain in
full force and effect. There shall be no liability on the part of any of the
parties hereto, except that such termination shall not preclude (a) any party
from pursuing its judicial remedies for damages as a result of the willful or
intentional breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or agreement
contained herein prior to termination or (b) Parent from pursuing its
contractual or judicial remedies for damages as a result of the failure of
the Closing to occur due to the proceeds of the financing having not been
received by the Purchaser in full by the Termination Date.
