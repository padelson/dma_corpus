-ii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 5, 2006,
by and among VALASSIS COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), MICHIGAN ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and ADVO, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_W I T N E S S E T H_ :

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Sub and Parent has
approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with
and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), other than shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent,
Sub or the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, will be converted
into the right to receive $37.00 in cash, without interest; and

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto (intending to be legally
bound) hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in
accordance with the DGCL.

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
McDermott Will and Emery LLP, 340 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall no longer be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall
take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall again
have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived
unless another time is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ". Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, Parent shall make or cause to be
made all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent
and the Company shall agree in writing, and shall specify in the Certificate
of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
").

Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL.

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Sub (the " _Sub Certificate_ " and " _Sub Bylaws_
", respectively) shall be the Surviving Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, respectively, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Sub_. The directors of Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The
officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.

Section 1.07 _Reservation of Right to Revise Transaction_. If each of Parent
and the Company agree in writing, they may change the method of effecting the
business combination between the Company and Parent, and each party shall
cooperate in such efforts, including to provide for a different form of
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter
or change the amount and kind of consideration to be received by holders of
Company Common Stock, (b) adversely affect the proposed accounting or tax
treatment of the Merger to the Company, Parent or their respective
stockholders and (c) materially delay receipt of any approval referred to in
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub or any
other person or entity:



 

\- 2 - (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Parent or Sub_. Each
share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(j), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive $37.00 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time,
subject to Section 2.02(j), all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, (ii) the Company
declares or pays any cash dividend (other than the $0.11 cash dividend
declared by the Board of Directors of the Company on June 22, 2006 and payable
on August 4, 2006 to record holders of Company Common Stock on July 28, 2006;
it being understood that no further dividends or distributions shall be
declared or paid by the Company to its stockholders while this Agreement is in
effect) or (iii) the Company declares or pays any non-cash dividends or
distributions, then in any such case the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such action. The right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable
tax Law.

(d) _Associated Rights_. References in this Agreement to Company Common Stock
shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated Rights
(as defined in the Rights Plan) issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement dated as of February 10, 2003 between
the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent (the " _Rights
Plan_ ").

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit,



 

\- 3 - or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.01(c). All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
2.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall,
upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.02(b) may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No payment of Merger
Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, in each case, until the holder
of such Certificate shall have surrendered such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Following the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares of
Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the Merger Consideration payable in respect therefor.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II.



 

\- 4 - (e) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall
be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of
Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided
in this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to Section
2.02(f) above.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the entering into of an indemnity and/or the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates or
holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates or holder of
Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

(j) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the
holder thereof  



 

\- 5 -  shall have properly perfected dissenters rights in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if
any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving
Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL,
affirmatively withdraws such holders demand for appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish such
holders entitlement to dissenters rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if
any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the
consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment under
Section 262 of the DGCL for such holders shares, such holder or holders (as
the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of
Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim
with respect to Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 2.03 _Stock Options_.

(a) Each option or right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") under the Companys 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan
(the " _2006 Plan_ "), the Companys 1998 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "
_1998 Plan_ "), the Companys 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
(the " _1995 Plan_ "), the Companys 1988 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the
" _1988 Plan_ "), and the Companys 1986 Stock Option Plan (the " _1986 Plan_
", together with the 2006 Plan, the 1998 Plan, the 1995 Plan, and the 1988
Plan, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested and each holder of an outstanding option
under the Company Stock Plans immediately before the Effective Time shall
receive, at the Effective Time, an amount of cash (without interest) for each
share of Company Common Stock underlying such option equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share of
such option, and such option shall thereafter be cancelled and of no further
force and effect.

(b) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions as may be required to effectuate the provisions
of Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(d).

(d) Following the date hereof, participants in the ESPP may not increase their
payroll deductions or purchase elections under the ESPP from those in effect
on the date of this Agreement. Each participants outstanding right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Companys ESPP shall
terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, provided that all amounts allocated to each participants account
under



 

\- 6 -  the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the
Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price
determined under the terms of the ESPP for the then outstanding offering
periods using such date as the final purchase date for each such offering
period and the ESPP shall terminate immediately following such purchases of
Company Common Stock.

Section 2.04 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

Section 2.05 _Note Purchase Agreement_.

(a) Reference is made to the Note Purchase Agreement (the " _Note
Purchase Agreement_ "), dated as of December 4, 2003, relating to the
$125,000,000 aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys 5.71%
Series A Senior Guaranteed Secured Notes due December 4, 2013 (the " _Series
A Notes_ ") and Floating Rate Series B Senior Guaranteed Secured Notes due
December 4, 2013 (the " _Series B Notes_ " and, collectively with the Series A
Notes, the " _Notes_ ").

(b) Within five (5) business days following the date hereof, the Company shall
give written notice to each holder of the Notes stating that a Control Event
(as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) has occurred. Such notice shall
comply with the terms of Section 8.3 of the Note Purchase Agreement. In
addition, the Company agrees to allow Parent, Sub or one of its Affiliates, at
any time after the date of this Agreement, to commence a cash tender offer or
other cash offer (as determined by Parent in its sole discretion) to purchase
all of the outstanding Notes (the " _Debt Offer_ "). The Debt Offer shall
be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement and
all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable Laws. The
consummation of the Debt Offer shall not be a condition to the Closing.

(c) Parent and Sub shall have sole discretion over the terms, timing and
structure of the Debt Offer (including the price thereof and the appointment
of a solicitation agent, if any); _provided_ , that the Debt Offer shall
provide that the consummation thereof shall be subject to the consummation of
the Effective Time. The Company agrees to reasonably cooperate, and to cause
its Representatives to reasonably cooperate, including assisting to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent in the preparation of and executing all
documents in connection therewith in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Sub and taking any other reasonable actions Parent
and Sub reasonably determine to be necessary in connection therewith
(including providing a list to Parent of the current holders of the Notes;
_provided_ , that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not
be required to (i) make any cash expenditures or (ii) take any action that
could obligate the Company, Parent or Sub to repurchase any Notes or incur any
liabilities or additional obligations to the holders of the Notes prior to
the consummation of the Debt Offer. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub agree
to comply in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to
the Debt Offer.

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates should be discovered by the
Company, which if not set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
documents mailed to holders in respect of the Debt Offer would reasonably be
expected to cause such documents to include any misstatement of a  



 

\- 7 -  material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the Parent and Sub and, to the extent required by law, rules or
regulations, the Company shall provide to the Parent and Sub such information.
Parent shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all materials sent
to holders of the Notes.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 3.01 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (" _Filed Company
SEC Documents_ ") and except as set forth in the disclosure schedule (with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates,
provided that the listing of an item on one Schedule shall be deemed to be a
listing on each other Schedule and to apply to any other representation and
warranty of the Company in Article III of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure item on its face
that it would also qualify or apply to such other representation or warranty)
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Sub as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of the Company and its
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X) has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may be. Each of
the Companys Non-Significant Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, except where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing and in good standing
individually or in the aggregate does not and will not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has all requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use
its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate
its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to have such power, authority, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to

operations as currently conducted, except for such authorizations,
certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits and approvals

have a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2003, there has occurred no

arising under Environmental Laws. The term " _Environmental Laws_ " means all
applicable Federal, state, local and foreign Laws (including the common law),

Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound. As of the date of this
Agreement, other than those employees at the Windsor, Connecticut Facility who

Section 4.02 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to,
and shall cause each of the foregoing persons respective directors,
officers, management personnel, Affiliates, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other advisors, agents and
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed
to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any  



 

\- 29 - discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
information relating to any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Subsidiary of the Company and/or any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall cause each of their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, in response to a
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably
likely lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not
solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may,
subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (A) furnish non-public information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality and standstill agreement not less restrictive to
such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, provided
that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to
such person, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or
20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person
or the shareholders of any person would own 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any
resulting parent company of the Company, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, good faith offer made
by a third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its
shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or a majority of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole), which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (i) to be more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial and other
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in  



 

\- 30 -  response to such Takeover Proposal or otherwise)) and (ii) which provides
for fully committed and available financing and, other than in the case of
a strategic buyer that the Board believes (with the advice of a financial
advisor) has adequate financing resources to consummate the proposal, for
which such person has received executed financing commitment letters from
reputable sources. 

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (A) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent (including,
without limitation, changing its recommendation to a "neutral" position), or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
(including, without limitation, changing its recommendation to a "neutral"
position), the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any
such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) adopt or recommend or take
any "neutral" position with respect to, or propose publicly to adopt or
recommend or take any "neutral" position with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal (any and all actions described in any one or more subclauses of
this Section 4.02(b)(A) or Section 4.02(b)(B) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ". Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 4.02(f) or Section 4.02(g) hereof. Except as
provided in Section 4.02(f), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor
any committee thereof shall adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal
or Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement
referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval and subject to the Boards and the Companys compliance in all
material respects with this Section 4.02, the Board of Directors of
the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02(f); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.02(f) until after
the third business day following Parents receipt of written notice (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying
the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
three (3) business day period shall commence). In determining whether to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
4.02(a) and 4.02(b), the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing (which in no event shall exceed 48 hours) of any Takeover
Proposal, the financial and other material terms and  



 

\- 31 - conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and
the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall (i) promptly keep Parent fully informed orally and in writing in all
material respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any Takeover Proposal and any discussions related thereto, and
(ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (which in no event shall exceed
48 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof of copies of any and all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives from
any person that relates to the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal
and any and all correspondence and other written material sent or provided by
(or on behalf of) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in response thereto or otherwise in connection
therewith.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by Section 4.02(b) (it being understood that any accurate
disclosure of factual information to the shareholders of the Company that is
required to be made to such shareholders under applicable federal securities
Laws shall not be considered a modification prohibited by Section 4.02(b)(A)).

(e) For a period of not less than three (3) business days after Parents
receipt from the Company of each Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise
this Agreement such that the Takeover Proposal constituting a Superior
Proposal shall no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f) In response to the receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal that has
not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after the
Companys compliance with the last paragraph of Section 4.02(b) and with
Section 4.02(e), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e) and enter into an
agreement with a third party with respect to such Superior Proposal, if (and
only if) each of the following three conditions are met:

(i) the Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by such time;

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith,
following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its shareholders under applicable
Law; and

(iii) prior to terminating this Agreement and/or entering into an agreement
reflecting a Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal, the Company shall have
paid the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.05 hereof.



 

\- 32 - (g) Assuming the Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by such
time, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors of the Company, in circumstances not involving a Takeover Proposal,
from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change to the extent that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that such action is necessary under applicable law in order for
the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders and terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g);
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Board of Directors having the right
to effect or otherwise make public any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(and prior to the Company terminating this Agreement), the Company shall have
paid the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.05 hereof. The
Company shall give Parent written notice of any consideration of such action
proposed to be taken by the Board of Directors not later than the business
day immediately prior to the day on which such action is proposed to be taken,
setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken and the
basis therefor.

(h) As soon as practicable, but in no event more than 48 hours following a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change made by the Companys Board
of Directors or any committee thereof, the Company shall make a public
announcement of such Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

Superior Proposal).

Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial

and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all other

inspections shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; and _provided_ _further_ , that the Company shall not be
required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) so confer, afford such
access or furnish such copies or other information to the extent that doing so
would result in a violation of law, result in the loss of attorney-client

allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss
of attorney-client privilege, including through the use of joint defense
agreements) or which are subject to confidentiality obligations owing to
third parties. Without limiting the foregoing, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided or
received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement to effect the Closing or otherwise (
_i.e._ , no such investigation, information or knowledge of any event, fact,
or circumstance shall be deemed to vitiate any rights of any party hereto).

(d) The Company shall use its best efforts to file with the SEC when due under
law its Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

Section 5.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary to
consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) that the
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied, (ii) the taking of all acts
necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as

waivers, consents, clearances, and approvals from Governmental Entities and
non-governmental third parties and the making of all necessary registrations
and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and (iv) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties.
In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent
shall (A) file as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 10 business
days unless the parties mutually agree otherwise) with the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the notification and
report form (the " _HSR Filing_ ") required under the HSR Act with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B)
make, as promptly as practicable, all notifications and other filings required
under any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or
similar Law that the Company and Parent deem advisable or appropriate, in
each case with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
as



 

\- 35 - promptly as practicable (together with the HSR Filings, the " _Antitrust
Filings_ "). The Antitrust Filings shall be in substantial compliance with
the requirements of the Laws, as applicable. Subject to first having used all
reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution of any objections underlying such
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, Company and Parent shall jointly defend
and contest any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking
to have any stay, temporary restraining order, or preliminary injunction
entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or reversed.

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and any other

in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by providing
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made
by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors)
with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party
and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that material may be redacted (x) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (y) as necessary to
address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns. Except as
otherwise required by law, neither party shall file any such document or take
such action if the other party has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its
objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of such action on the
grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be expected to either (i)
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause a condition set
forth in Article VI to not be satisfied in a timely manner. Neither party
shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or
waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Entity without the consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

(c) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent (or any of their respective
Affiliates) receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Each of the Company and Parent will make all
reasonable efforts not to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to
participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, shall give the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate. Each party will advise the other
party promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) which the first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in



 

\- 36 - limitation of the foregoing, each party will use all reasonable efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used all reasonable
efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and
resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation, decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable
so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Section 5.03), the Parent and its
Subsidiaries are not required to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent
or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets or business of the Company, Parent, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in any manner which, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings,
agreements and Orders has or would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the combined business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall take or commit to take such
actions, including, without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
transfer, license, divestiture or other disposition of, or that limit or would
limit Parents or its Subsidiaries ability to retain, any business, assets
or operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries generating revenues of up to $60
million in Parents fiscal year 2005, in each case as may be required in order
to resolve any objections under the antitrust laws to the Merger or to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing, materially delaying or materially
impairing the consummation of the Merger. Furthermore, without the prior
written consent of the Parent (determined in its sole discretion), in no event
shall the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries: (i) pay
any consideration to, amend or enter into any agreement with, any non-
governmental third party to obtain any consent to the Merger or to otherwise
comply with Section 5.03(e); (ii) agree to the imposition of limitations on
the ability of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to hold, or exercise full
rights of ownership of, any shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation, including the right to vote such shares on all matters properly
presented to the shareholders of the Surviving Corporation, (iii) agree to
prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any
respect the business, assets or operations of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries generating revenue in excess of $60 million in
Parents fiscal year 2005, (iv) agree to any consent decree, divestiture, hold
separate order or comparable arrangement, or any sale, transfer, license,
divestiture or other disposition of any assets of Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries generating revenue in excess of $60
million in Parents fiscal year 2005, or any limitation on the Parents
acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full
rights of ownership, of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or the termination or
amendment of any existing relationships and contractual



 

\- 37 - rights or (v) agree to any matter that has or reasonably would be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect. In the
event that Parent grants such written consent, the Company shall agree to the
matters as directed by Parent (which agreement may be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing).

(e) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover Law
or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent acknowledges that the Surviving Corporation shall by operation of
law assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, the By-laws or any indemnification
Contract between such directors, officers, employees or agents and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof and which have been heretofore disclosed to Parent), without further
action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time.

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.04 for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time.
In the event (A) the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of
its assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, or (B)
Parent takes any action to materially impair the financial ability of the
Surviving Corporation to satisfy the obligations referred to in Section
5.04(a), Parent will either guarantee such obligations or take such other
action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving Corporation, legal and
financial, to satisfy such obligations will not be diminished in any material
respect.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or
indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect
directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently
covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy



 

\- 38 - maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (a complete and accurate binder
for which has been heretofore delivered to Parent, and a complete and
accurate copy of which will be delivered to Parent promptly upon receipt
thereof) on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts comparable to the
insurance maintained currently by the Company or its Subsidiaries,
as applicable; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous in the aggregate to the
beneficiaries of the current policies and with carriers having an A.M. Best
financial strength rating of A (or, if such presently existing Company and
Subsidiary policies have lower ratings, than with carriers having at least a
rating equal to such lower rating) or better, provided that such substitution
shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, and _provided further_ that the
Surviving Corporation shall first use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from such carriers a so-called "tail" policy providing such coverage and
being effective for the full six year period referred to above, and shall be
entitled to obtain such coverage in annual policies from such carriers only if
it is unable, after exerting such efforts for a reasonable period of time, to
obtain such a "tail" policy; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 150%of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof as set
forth in Section 5.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or, in the case
of a "tail" policy obtained pursuant to the preceding proviso, shall not be
required to pay an aggregate premium therefor in excess of an amount equal to
six times 150% of such last annual premium) and, if the Surviving Corporation
is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.04(c), it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium (or an
aggregate premium, as the case may be) equal to such maximum amount.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.04: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party identified in
this Section 5.04, his or her heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise. It is expressly agreed that the indemnified parties identified in
this Section 5.04 shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.04.

Section 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided in Sections 5.05(b), 5.05(c) and 5.05(d), all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(e), or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(g) or by Parent pursuant
to Section 7.01(f); or

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the obtaining of the
Shareholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company generally
or shall have otherwise



 

\- 39 -  become publicly known, disclosed or proposed or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and (C) within 12 months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract (which
is thereafter consummated) to consummate, or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (provided that, for purposes of this
Section 5.05(b)(ii), all references to 20% in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be 50%) with any person; or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(b) and
(B) within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive Contract (which is thereafter consummated) to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (provided
that, for purposes of this Section 5.05(b)(iii), all references to 20% in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be 50%) with any person;

then (in the case of the occurrence of any one or more of Section 5.05(b)(i),
Section 5.05(b)(ii) and Section 5.05(b)(iii)) the Company shall pay Parent a
fee equal to thirty-eight million dollars (US$38,000,000) (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") (less any Parent Expenses that may previously have been
paid or are payable) by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later
than the first business day following (x) in the case of a payment required
by Section 5.05(b)(i), the date of termination of this Agreement, and (y) in
the case of a payment required by Section 5.05(b)(ii) above or Section
5.05(b)(iii) above, the date of the consummation of such Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that if Section 4.02 hereof requires payment prior to
termination pursuant to its terms, then Section 4.02 shall control with
respect to when the payment hereunder is due to Parent. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall more than one Parent Termination Fee be payable under
this Agreement.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(ii) or Section 7.01(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent
an amount equal to the sum of Parent Expenses (not to exceed ten million
dollars (US$10,000,000) in the aggregate) for which Parent has not
theretofore been reimbursed by the Company in cash by wire transfer in
immediately available funds and, other than as provided in Section 5.05(b),
the Company shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent (provided that nothing herein
shall release any party from liability for bad faith, intentional misconduct
or fraud), such payment to be made following such termination within
two business days following delivery to the Company of notice of demand for
such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Expenses_ "
means, with respect to a party hereto, all reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and
expenses of debt financing sources (including those who are parties to any
financing commitments), counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the sale process, including the authorization,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including Parents financing. The amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 5.05(b) and (c) hereof constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy in the event of
termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such Sections
(provided that nothing herein shall release any party from liability for bad
faith, intentional misconduct or fraud).



 

\- 40 - (d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Sections 5.05(b), 5.05(c) and this 5.05(d) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due the amount payable pursuant
to Section 5.05(b) or Section 5.05(c), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit, the Company shall pay to Parent the costs and
expenses of Parent (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses (as the case may be), from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of receipt by Parent of
immediately available funds in such amount at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to the announcement
of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the express terms of Section 4.02 of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such
party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

Section 5.07 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or their respective directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, denied or delayed).

Section 5.08 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent agrees to, and to cause the Company to, honor all Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms of such plans and
applicable law and this Agreement. For a period of two years following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time (it being understood that any grant of equity based
compensation awards to Company Employees shall remain discretionary), provided
that after December 31, 2006, Parent may satisfy its obligations under this
sentence by providing Company Employees with compensation and benefits that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to employees of
Parent and its pre-Merger Subsidiaries who perform comparable duties
and services as such Company Employee will perform at Parent and its
Subsidiaries.



 

\- 41 - (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be receive credit for
his or her years of service with the Company and its affiliates before the
Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities), to the same
extent that such Company Employee received credit for such service before the
Effective Time (except (i) for credit for benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan and (ii) to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall not be subject to
any waiting time in any New Plan in which such Company Employee is eligible
to become a participant; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year ending on the date such employees participation
in the New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person.

Section 5.09 _Rights Agreement_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section
3.01(e)) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, amend, take
any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights
Agreement (including a redemption of the Company Rights) to facilitate a
Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal.

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or
their directors, officers or stockholders, under this Agreement, other than
the provisions of Section 3.01(t), Section 3.02(f), Section 5.05, this Section
7.02 and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive such termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto from any liability or damages resulting from the willful and material
breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or for bad faith, intentional
misconduct or fraud.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,

behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Section 7.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

contained herein.

 



 

\- 46 - Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights
nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of
any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise
of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

Section 7.05 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
Parent or the Company, action by its respective Board of Directors.
