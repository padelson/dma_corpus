Gloucester, ME and New Haven, CT </B>&#150; <B>February&nbsp;25, 2015</B> &#150; Iberdrola USA and UIL Holdings Corporation (NYSE: UIL) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Iberdrola USA will acquire UIL and
create a newly listed U.S. publicly-traded company. The agreement, which has been unanimously approved by both companies&#146; Boards of Directors, creates a leading, diversified power and utility company in the Northeast. UIL&#146;s current
President and Chief Executive Officer, James P. Torgerson, will become the company&#146;s CEO upon closing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The proposed transaction implies total value
per share to UIL shareholders of $52.75, including $10.50 per share paid in the form of cash, representing a 24.6% premium to UIL&#146;s closing share price on February&nbsp;25, 2015, and a 19.3% premium to the average closing price over the past 30
days. The value of the stock consideration received is based on the mid-point of the combined company&#146;s estimated 2016 and 2017 earnings per share valued at peer P/E multiples of 17.5x and 16.5x, respectively. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This combination creates a larger, more diversified power and utility company with seven highly-regarded
regulated electric and gas utilities in complementary geographies: Iberdrola USA&#146;s New York State Electric&nbsp;&amp; Gas (NYSE&amp;G), Rochester Gas&nbsp;&amp; Electric (RG&amp;E) and Central Maine Power (CMP), and UIL&#146;s United
Illuminating (UI), Southern Connecticut Gas (SCG), Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG) and Berkshire Gas (BGC). The combined entity will have a rate base of approximately $8.3 billion and expects to invest $6.9 billion in regulated electric and gas
infrastructure and other capital expenditures over the next five years. The combined company will serve 3.1&nbsp;million electric and gas customers across New York, Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts. It will also have a highly-contracted 6.5 GW
primarily renewables portfolio, which includes the second largest operating wind portfolio in the U.S., and a total pipeline of over 6 GW. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A vast
majority of Iberdrola USA&#146;s current renewable generation portfolio is contracted to utilities under long-term agreements and approximately 95% of the combined company&#146;s gross margin is projected to be derived from regulated operations or
contracted generation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ignacio Gal&aacute;n, Chairman of IBERDROLA, said: &#147;The transaction integrates Iberdrola USA and UIL, is consistent with
Group strategy and creates a significant company in the United States, a key market in which we are taking a major step forward. It also reflects our preference for effecting friendly corporate transactions.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Iberdrola is an ideal long-term partner for our customers, our employees and the communities we serve,&#148; said Mr.&nbsp;Torgerson, President and
Chief Executive Officer of UIL. &#147;We will be a more diversified and stronger utility as a group with greater scale and financial resources to support continued investment in system reliability and infrastructure projects to ensure customers
continue to receive the safe, reliable and cost-efficient service that they have come to expect from our top-performing companies. Our combined company will also benefit from a shared commitment to industry excellence, high-quality customer service
and giving back to the communities we serve.&#148; Noting the geographic concentration of regulated businesses in the Northeast, Mr.&nbsp;Torgerson added, &#147;The combined company will be able to draw upon even more resources to react and respond
to needs in any part of the system, especially in weather emergencies.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This is a very compelling transaction for our shareholders. The
combination will be immediately accretive to UIL&#146;s cash flow profile and includes a $10.50 cash payment for each share currently owned,&#148; Mr.&nbsp;Torgerson continued. &#147;Shareholders will also participate in the future upside prospects
of the combined company, enabled by leveraging its balance sheet strength to pursue additional investment opportunities in the Northeast and across the U.S., such as its highly attractive renewable energy development portfolio.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Other Information </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combined company&#146;s robust
financial profile will provide the financial flexibility to aggressively pursue near- and long-term growth opportunities, particularly in transmission and contracted wind. UIL will benefit from being a part of a group with lower leverage and with
immediate cash flow accretion, supporting a strong investment grade credit rating and enabling the combined company to execute a $6.9 billion, five-year regulated capital expenditure program. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of the transaction, it is expected that long-term earnings per share will grow by approximately
10% annually through 2019. The combined company will initially set its dividend at UIL&#146;s current quarterly dividend of $1.728 per share, and will target a competitive dividend based on a 65% to 75% payout ratio long-term. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Torgerson will become CEO of the combined company and will select and lead a U.S.-based leadership team from among the UIL and Iberdrola USA business
leadership. Iberdrola and UIL will continue to have offices in New Haven, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and New York. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the close of the
transaction, Mr.&nbsp;Torgerson, in addition to two current UIL directors, will join Iberdrola USA&#146;s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors for the newly-listed combined entity will consist of up to nine Iberdrola USA directors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combined company will honor all existing labor agreements with UIL&#146;s unions and maintain UIL&#146;s charitable giving and corporate philanthropy
programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transaction is subject to regulatory and UIL shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to
close by the end of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2014 Financial Results </B></P>
