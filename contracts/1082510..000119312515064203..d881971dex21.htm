Section 2.3 _Cancellation and Conversion of Stock_.

 

(a) _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of the holder of any Blue Common
Stock, any Merger Sub common stock or any Green Common Stock:

(i) _Cancellation of Blue Common Stock_. Each issued share of Blue Common
Stock that is owned by Blue (as a treasury share or otherwise, other than any
shares owned on behalf of third parties) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable hereunder in connection with
such cancellation.

 

(ii) _Conversion of Remaining Blue Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding
share of Blue Common Stock (other than the issued shares of Blue Common Stock
referenced in _Section 2.3(a)(i)_) shall be converted into the right to
receive (x) one (1) validly issued share of Green Common Stock, credited as
fully paid, which, when issued, ranks _pari passu_ in all respects with all
of the shares of Green Common Stock then in issue (the " _Stock Consideration_
") and (y) $10.50 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the
Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(iii) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one

(b) _Surrender and Exchange of Shares_.

 

(i) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the
Effective Time, Blue shall select a bank or trust company, reasonably
acceptable to Green (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (together
with any other bank or trust company also so selected, the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the purpose of delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of
Blue Common Stock the shares of Green Common Stock and the Cash Consideration
that such holder shall become entitled to receive with respect to
such holders shares of Blue Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.
The Exchange Agent shall act as agent for each holder of shares of Blue Common
Stock in connection therewith.

 

(ii) Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_, at the direction of Green, there shall be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from time to time, that amount of
immediately

 



24  available cash (such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
") and number of shares of Green Common Stock as are deliverable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_, and which, unless Green shall otherwise determine, shall
be deposited with the Exchange Agent through the facilities of The Depository
Trust Company. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed
by Green; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under  _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_
shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange
Agent to make prompt cash payment under _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_, Green shall
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Exchange Agent to make such payments under _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_.

(iii) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
by the Exchange Agent to each record holder, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of shares of Blue Common Stock that are represented by book
entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") or represented by certificates ("
_Certificates_ "), a form of letter of transmittal in customary form (as Green
shall reasonably specify after consultation with Blue), which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Book Entry
Shares or Certificates held by such holder representing such shares of Blue
Common Stock shall pass, only upon actual and proper delivery of Book Entry
Shares or Certificates (or satisfaction of the replacement requirements in
lieu of the Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.3(b)(viii)_) to the
Exchange Agent.

 

(iv) Each holder of shares of Blue Common Stock that are represented by Book
Entry Shares or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
such holders shares of Blue Common Stock that are represented by Book Entry
Shares or Certificates (or satisfaction of the replacement requirements in
lieu of a Certificate, as provided in  _Section 2.3(b)(viii)_), upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Book Entry Share or Certificate, together
with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the number of shares of
Green Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) and the Cash Consideration deliverable
in respect of such holders shares of Blue Common Stock represented by such
holders properly surrendered Book Entry Shares or Certificates (or
satisfaction of the replacement requirements in lieu of the Certificates, as
provided in  _Section 2.3(b)(viii)_) in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_,
and Book Entry Shares or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled, and Greens register of members shall be updated accordingly.

 



25 (v) If delivery of shares of Green Common Stock and the Cash Consideration
in respect of shares of Blue Common Stock represented by a Book Entry Share
or Certificate is directed by the person in whose name the surrendered Book
Entry Share or Certificate is registered to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Book Entry Share or Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of delivery that the Book Entry Share or
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or
delivery shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the delivery of the shares of Green Common Stock and the
Cash Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Book
Entry Share or Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. Until so surrendered, each Book Entry Share and Certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable shares of Green Common Stock and
the Cash Consideration, but shall not entitle its holder or any other person
to any rights as a stockholder of Green or shareholder of Blue.

(vi) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Blue shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Blue Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time.
After the Effective Time, Book Entry Shares and Certificates presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Section 2.3_. The shares of Green Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Book Entry Shares and Certificates and the payment
of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Blue Common Stock formerly represented by
such Book Entry Shares and Certificates.

(vii) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Green Common Stock
deliverable with respect to the shares of Blue Common Stock shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Book Entry Shares or Certificates until after
those Book Entry Shares or Certificates are surrendered as provided in this 
_Section 2.3_. After surrender, there shall be delivered and/or paid to the
holder of the Green Common Stock delivered in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) (A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to those shares of Green Common Stock with
a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid, and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to those shares of Green Common Stock with a record date on or after
the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender
and (ii) at the time of payment and delivery of such shares of Green Common
Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(v)_, all dividends or
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time, that have
been declared by Blue with respect to the Blue

 



26  Common Stock in accordance with _Section 6.5(b)(iv)_ hereof in all respects
as well as with the other terms of this Agreement, but that have not been paid
on such Blue Common Stock. 

(viii) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by
Green or the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary
form and amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect
to the Certificate and compliance with such other reasonable replacement
requirements established by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable shares of Green Common Stock and the Cash Consideration
deliverable in respect of the shares of Blue Common Stock represented by the
Certificate pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

 

(ix) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Green, Merger Sub, Blue, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any former holder of shares of Blue Common Stock or Blue Stock
Awards pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of this payment under the
Code or under any provision of any Tax Law. Blue, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Green in coordinating the deduction
and withholding of any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under
applicable Tax Law, including payroll Taxes relating to payments made in
respect of Blue Stock Awards. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, Green, Merger Sub, Blue,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be
treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of shares of Blue Common Stock or Blue Stock Awards, sold this
consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of the
consideration at the time of the deemed sale and paid these cash proceeds to
the appropriate Governmental Authority.

(c) _No Appraisal Rights_. There are no appraisal rights available to holders
of Blue Common Stock under the Act in connection with the Merger.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Each award of restricted Blue Common Stock granted under the Blue Stock
Plans that is outstanding and unvested or otherwise subject to forfeiture or
other restrictions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Blue
Restricted Shares_ "), other than those Blue Restricted Shares that vest by
their terms upon the consummation of the Merger (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, at the Effective Time shall be converted into only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration), shall be converted into the right to receive the
number of validly-issued restricted shares of Green Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of the number of such
Blue Restricted Shares multiplied by the Equity

 



27  Exchange Factor, _provided_ , _however_ , that any restricted shares of
Green Common Stock received in respect of such Blue Restricted Shares shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture
restrictions) as were applicable to the corresponding Blue Restricted Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the " _Equity Exchange Factor_ " shall be the sum of one (1) plus a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Consideration and the denominator of which
is the Average Blue Stock Price minus the Cash Consideration.

 

(b) Each award of restricted stock units, performance shares, stock units,
phantom stock units or other similar rights or awards granted or deferred
under a Blue Stock Plan and relating to shares of Blue Common Stock (any such
award, a " _Blue Equity Right_ " and such awards together with the Blue
Restricted Shares, the " _Blue Stock Awards_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to relate to or represent
a right to receive shares of Blue Common Stock and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, into an award of restricted stock units, performance
shares, stock units, phantom stock units or other similar rights or awards,
as applicable, relating to shares of Green Common Stock (a " _Green Equity
Right_ ") of the same type and on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the corresponding Blue Equity Right, except as adjusted hereby.
The number of shares of Green Common Stock covered by each such Green Equity
Right shall be equal in number to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole
number) of the number of shares of Blue Common Stock subject to the
corresponding Blue Equity Right multiplied by the Equity Exchange Factor.

(c) With respect to any Blue Stock Award that is, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any performance-based vesting or other performance
conditions (a " _Blue Performance Award_ "), determination of performance
shall be made pursuant to the terms of such Blue Performance Award.

(d) Blue shall take all actions necessary to provide that as of the Effective
Time, no participant in the Blue Holdings Corporation 2012 Non-Qualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Blue ESPP_ ") will have any right under
such plan to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Blue Common Stock
thereunder and that no further payroll deductions will be made under the Blue
ESPP. The Blue ESPP shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Blue shall take all necessary actions for
the adjustment of Blue Stock Awards under this _Section 2.4_ within its power
and consistent with the terms of the Blue Stock Awards; _provided_ that such
actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger
and shall be of no effect if this Agreement is terminated. Green shall reserve
for issuance a number of shares of Green Common Stock at least equal to the
number of shares of Green Common Stock that will be subject to Green Equity
Rights as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.4_.

Section 2.5  _Directors of Green and Blue_. As of the Closing, the board of
directors of Green shall consist of up to twelve (12) directors of which three
(3) shall be directors who were members of the Blue Board immediately prior to
the Closing selected by Green and the remainder shall be other directors
selected by Green. As of the Closing, at least six (6) directors of Green
shall be independent of Green and Green Parent within the meaning of the rules
of the NYSE. From and after the Closing, Green will comply with any
applicable Law with respect to the composition of its board of directors.

 



28 Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the effect of  _Section 6.4_ and
_Section 6.5_, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Green Common Stock (as contemplated to be adjusted
by _Section 6.17(c)_) or Blue Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend or any subdivision, reclassification, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained in this Agreement (including
any exchange ratio) which is based upon the number of shares of Green Common
Stock or shares of Blue Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Green Parent and the holders of Blue
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.6_
shall be construed to permit or authorize any Party to take, or authorize,
any action that is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant
to this Agreement.

do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of "good standing") in each jurisdiction in which the

result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets or
properties of the Representing Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint
Ventures under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (A) the
respective Charter Documents of the Representing Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures, or (B) subject to the taking of the actions

is bound, excluding from the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Representing
Party.

 

Section 4.3 _Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures_.

Representing Partys Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, including (i) the name
of each such entity and its form and jurisdiction of organization, (ii) a
brief description of the principal line or lines of business conducted by each

30  Representing Partys Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures has the requisite power
and authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.
Each of the Representing Party and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good
standing" concept is applicable), except where the failure to be so qualified

a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Representing Party.

Significant Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and the Representing
Partys Significant Subsidiaries are in compliance with the provisions of

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Representing Party. Since December 31, 2014 through and including the date of
this Agreement, no action has been taken with respect to the Representing
Party or any of its Subsidiaries which, if taken after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing would, in respect of Blue, constitute
a violation of _Section 6.5(b)(i)-(vii)_, _(xi)_ or _(xv)_ or, in respect
of Green, constitute a violation of _Section 6.4(b)(i)-(vi)_, _(ix)_ ,
_(xiii)_ or _(xvii)_.

 

Section 4.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Representing Party nor

are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Representing Party, threatened,
actions, suits, arbitrations or proceedings by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to or affecting the Representing Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures or any of their respective assets and
properties, nor to the Knowledge of the Representing Party are there any
Governmental Authority investigations, inquiries or audits pending or
threatened against, relating to or affecting, the Representing Party or any of
its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures or any of their respective assets and
properties, that, in each case, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
the Representing Party, and (ii) none of the Representing Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures or any of their respective assets is subject
to any order of any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse

Section 4.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Representing Party for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 will, at the date it is first
mailed to Blues shareholders or on any other date of filing with the SEC, or
at the time of the Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that with respect to projected financial information, if any,
provided by or on behalf of the Representing Party, the Representing Party
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith by management
of the Representing Party on the basis of assumptions believed by such
management to be reasonable as of the time made.

Section 4.8  _Permits; Compliance with Laws and Orders_. The Representing
Party, together with its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, holds all permits,
licenses, certificates, notices, franchises, authorizations, approvals and
similar consents from Governmental Authorities (" _Permits_ ") necessary or
required for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses, except for
failures to hold such Permits that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Representing Party. The Representing Party and its
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures are, and since January 1, 2012 have been, in
compliance with the terms of their Permits, except failures so to comply
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably

(i) Each of the Green Parties under the jurisdiction of the FERC, the New York
Public Service Commission or the Maine Public Utilities Commission is legally
entitled to provide services in all areas (i) where it currently provides
service to its customers, and (ii) as identified in their respective tariffs,
service agreements and other Contracts with its customers, except for
failures to be so entitled that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Green Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(j) Green has designed, established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (or, in the case of
the Green IFRS Financial Statements, IFRS) and provide reasonable
assurance that all transactions are executed in accordance in all material
respects with managements general or specific authorization, all transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the Green Financial
Statements in conformity with GAAP (or, in the case of the Green IFRS
Financial Statements, IFRS) and fraud is detected and prevented. Except for
matters resolved prior to the date hereof, since January 1, 2012 through the
date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Green, (A) neither Green nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives has received
or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation
or claim (whether written or oral) from any source regarding the accounting

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Green or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters of Green or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
concerns (whether written or oral) from any of the Green Parties employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters have been received by
Green or any of its Subsidiaries, and (B) no attorney representing Green or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by any such entity, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Green, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective directors, officers or employees to the General Counsel or
Chief Executive Officer of Green.

 

(k) Green has made available to Blue any management letters or other material
written communications (including with respect to proposed adjustments) from
the auditors to any of Green or any of its Subsidiaries, any officer of any of
Green or any of its Subsidiaries or the board of directors (or equivalent
body) of any of Green or its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, in any case
regarding (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect, or to have adversely affected (in more than immaterial
respects), Greens ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or any material weaknesses in internal

 



53  control over financial reporting or (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Greens internal control over financial reporting.

(l) The Green Financial Statements reflect, in accordance with GAAP (or, in
the case of the Green IFRS Financial Statements, IFRS), an adequate reserve
for all Taxes payable by Green and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
through the date of such Green Financial Statements, and since such date,
neither Green nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability
for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business.

Section 5.12 _Shared Assets and Services_. _Section 5.12_ of the Green
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of (i) all assets or properties of Green

any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures provides to or receives from Green
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures (other than Green or any

not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the conduct of the
business of the Green Parties, taken as whole. The expenses and revenues under
each of the Contracts listed on _Section 5.12_ of the Green Disclosure
Schedule are accurately reflected in the Green IFRS Financial Statements
included on  _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Green Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.13 _Employee Benefit Plans of Green_. No Green Employee Benefit
Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States or covers any
employee of Green or any of its Subsidiaries who resides or works outside of
the United States. No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Green
or its ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a risk to Green or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any
such liability, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Green Material Adverse Effect.
No purpose of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is for any of
Green Parent or its Affiliates to avoid Liability arising out of Title IV of
ERISA.

Section 5.14 _Anti-Takeover Provisions Inapplicable to Green_. The
Transactions are not subject to any "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "affiliate transactions," "business combination" or other state
antitakeover Laws.

 

Section 5.15 _Organization and Qualification of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state of its organization and has full power and authority to conduct its
business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its
assets and properties. Merger Sub is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to
do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of "good standing") in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct
or nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified,

 



54  licensed or admitted and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize the concept of "good standing") that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Green
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.16 _No Conflicts with Respect to Merger Sub; Approvals and Consents
of Merger Sub_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger Sub
does not, and the performance by Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder and
the consummation of the Transactions will not, conflict with, result in a
violation or breach of, constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under, result in or give to any Person any right of payment or
reimbursement, termination, revocation, cancellation, modification
or acceleration of, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon
any of the assets or properties of Merger Sub under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (A) the Charter Documents of Merger Sub, or (B)
subject to the taking of the actions described in _Section 5.10_, (x) any
Laws applicable to Merger Sub or any of its assets or properties, or (y) any
Contract, Permit or other instrument to which Merger Sub is a party or by
which Merger Sub or any of its assets or properties is bound, excluding from
the foregoing clauses (x) - (y) such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Green
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.17 _Green Renewables Contracts_. _Section 5.17_ of the Green
Disclosure Schedule contains a chart setting forth the project, expiration
year and megawatt volume for each contract that purports to bind any Green
Party pursuant to which at least 10 megawatts of electric generation capacity
of Green Renewables or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures has been
contracted to a counterparty (the " _Green Renewables Contracts_ "), which
list is true, complete and correct in all material respects. Green has made
available to Blue the annual gross margin for each of the next ten years for
the Green Renewables Contracts on an aggregate basis. None of the Green
Renewables Contracts contains a provision permitting the counterparty to such
contract to reduce the amount of capacity that such counterparty is obligated
to pay for or to reduce the capacity charge therefor pursuant to such
contract or to terminate such contract for any reason other than due to a
material breach by Green Renewables. None of Green Renewables nor any of its
Affiliates is in material breach of or material default under the terms of
any Green Renewables Contract and as of the date hereof no event has occurred
that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would result in a
material breach or default under any Green Renewables Contract. To the
Knowledge of Green, no other party to any Green Renewables Contract is in
material breach of or material default under the terms of any such Green
Renewables Contract, and no other party to the Green Renewables Contracts has
threatened to or is anticipated to reduce the amount of capacity that such
counterparty is obligated to pay for or to reduce the capacity charge therefor
pursuant to such contract or to terminate any Green Renewables Contract.

of the Effective Time will have available to them, all funds necessary for the
payment to the Exchange Agent of the aggregate Cash Consideration, all other
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Article II_ , and to satisfy all of
their other obligations under this Agreement.

its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws and to the extent such action is
necessary to allow such Person to make a confidential proposal to the Blue
Board.

 



56 (b) Blue shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours

therewith, or (ii) if it is oral, a reasonably detailed summary, including all
material terms, thereof. Blue shall keep Green informed on a reasonably
prompt basis with respect to any change to the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours

to Green, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the

Transactions (the " _Board Recommendation_ "), (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any Acquisition
Proposal, (C) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
or (D) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) (x) recommend, adopt or approve, or
publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve, or, other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and customary common interest agreement, allow Blue
or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to (or would
reasonably be expected to) lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or that would
require Blue to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions, or
(y) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the foregoing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Blue Board
or any committee thereof may, at any time prior to receipt of the Shareholder
Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal, if: (i) an Acquisition Proposal is made to Blue, (ii) the Blue Board
or applicable committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such offer
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action could
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, (iii) Blue provides Green five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take and the rationale for such action,
which notice shall include the information with respect to such Superior
Proposal that is specified in _Section 6.1(b)_ (it being understood that each
time any material revision or amendment to the terms of the Acquisition
Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal is made, the five (5) Business
Day period shall be extended for additional three (3) Business Days (for the
first extension) or two (2) Business Days (for each subsequent extension)
after notification of such change to Green), and (iv) at the end of the
applicable

 



57  periods described in clause (iii) (the " _Takeover Notice Period_ "), the
Blue Board again makes the determination in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into
account any adjustments or modifications proposed by Green during the Takeover
Notice Period), that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal. Blue agrees that during the Takeover Notice Period, Blue shall
negotiate in good faith with Green and its representatives, if requested by
Green, regarding any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Blue Board
may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to any Change first occurring or
becoming known to the Blue Board after the execution of this Agreement that
materially affects or could reasonably be expected to materially affect (i)
the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of Blue and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Green
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the shareholders of Blue
(including the benefits of the Merger to Blue or the shareholders of Blue),
in either case that (A) is material, individually or in the aggregate with any
other such Changes first occurring or becoming known to the Blue Board after
the execution of this Agreement and (B) does not involve or relate to an
Acquisition Proposal if: (x) Blue provides Green five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include all material information with respect to any such Changes and a
reasonably detailed description of the Blue Boards rationale for such action,
and (y) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in clause
(x), the Blue Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel (after taking into account any
adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Green
during the period described in clause (x)), that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws. During such five (5) Business Day period
described in clause (x), Blue shall negotiate in good faith with Green and
its representatives, if requested by Green, regarding any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement.

(f) [Intentionally Omitted]

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Blue or the Blue Board (or any committee thereof), directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, from disclosing to Blues shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to Blues shareholders if the Blue
Board has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that constitutes an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of this _Section
6.1_ with respect thereto (it being understood and agreed that any disclosure
of a position in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, other than
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or a recommendation on
Schedule 14D-9 against such tender offer or exchange offer made within ten
(10) Business Days after the commencement thereof and in any event at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Shareholder Meeting, shall be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Blue Board expressly
and concurrently reaffirms the Board Recommendation).

 



58 (h) The Parties agree that an Adverse Recommendation Change effected in
accordance with  _Section 6.1(d)_ or _Section 6.1(e)_ shall not in and of
itself violate any other provision of this Agreement.

Blue Parties becomes Known to Blue, Blue shall use its best efforts both to

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona fide_ proposal or offer
from any Person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of
assets or businesses of Blue or its Subsidiaries that, in the aggregate,
constitute or generate 15% or more of the consolidated net revenue or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (on an
estimated current replacement cost basis) for the preceding twelve (12) months
of Blue and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
any class of Equity Securities (by vote or value) of Blue or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if

of Blue or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (D) merger, consolidation,
business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization, liquidation,

the total voting power of the Equity Securities of Blue or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or the surviving entity in a merger with Blue or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries or the resulting direct or indirect parent of
Blue or such surviving entity, or (E) any combination of the foregoing, in
each case other than the Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
that the Blue Board or committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (taking

whether such Acquisition Proposal is subject to a financing condition),
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the Merger and
the other Transactions deemed in good faith to be relevant by the Blue Board
to the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (y) the identity of the
Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal, and (z) the likelihood of
completion of such Acquisition Proposal) would result in a transaction more
favorable to Blues shareholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger and the other Transactions (taking into account all of the terms of any
proposal by Green to amend or modify the terms of the Merger and the other
Transactions in response to such proposal or otherwise), except that the
references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition

 



59  Proposal" shall each be deemed to be a reference to "50%" and references to
"Blue or any of its Significant Subsidiaries" in clauses (B), (C) and (D) of
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"Blue".

Section 6.2 _Green No Solicitation_. Green shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors

respective officers, directors and employees) to immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Green Business Combination. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Closing and the date of termination of this Agreement,
Green shall not, shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and shall (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to) direct and use reasonable
best efforts to cause Greens Representatives (other than Greens and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries respective officers, directors and employees)
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage any Green Business Combination or any
inquiries, offers or the making of any proposal with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Green Business Combination, (ii) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to effect, any Green Business Combination or that would reasonably
be expected to cause Green to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions, (iii) enter into, initiate, continue, engage in or otherwise
participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Green Business Combination, or
(iv) agree or propose to do any of the foregoing. As used herein, " _Green
Business Combination_ " shall mean (x) any acquisition or purchase, in a
single transaction or a series of transactions of all or any material part of
the Green Companies (regardless of whether such acquisition or purchase is by
means of a sale of assets or a sale of Equity Securities of one or more of
the Green Companies or their Subsidiaries), other than the Transactions or (y)
any acquisition, purchase or corporate reorganization by the Green Companies
or their Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger. Any act or omission
by an Affiliate of Green that would be a violation of this _Section 6.2_ if
taken by Green shall be a breach by Green of this  _Section 6.2_.

Section 6.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form S-4; Provision of
Green Financial Statements; Shareholder_ _Meetings_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event within one hundred (100) days of the date of this Agreement, Green
shall prepare, and Green shall file with the SEC, a registration statement on
Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of the shares of Green Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger (together with any supplements or amendments thereto,
the " _Form S-4_ "). The Form S-4 will include a proxy statement prepared by
Blue and provided for inclusion in the Form S-4 not later than 30 days after
the date of this Agreement (together with any supplement or amendment
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the meeting of Blues
shareholders to be held for the purpose of obtaining the

 



60  Shareholder Approval (such meeting, the " _Shareholder Meeting_ ") in
accordance and in compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after the filing of the Form S-4, and promptly thereafter mail the
Proxy Statement to Blues shareholders. Each of Green and Blue shall also use
their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy prior to the effective
date of the Form S-4 all necessary state securities Law or "blue sky" notice
requirements in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. Each
of Green and Blue shall promptly supply to the other in writing, for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, all information concerning its respective
business required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder, to be included in the Proxy Statement
and Form S-4; provided that neither Party shall use any such information for
any other purpose if doing so would violate or cause the violation of
applicable securities Laws. Each of Green and Blue shall furnish all
information concerning itself as may reasonably be required in connection with
such actions and the preparation of the Form S-4. Each Party agrees to correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law. Each of Green and Blue shall notify the other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or for
additional information related to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 and will
promptly supply the other Party with copies of all correspondence between it
and its Affiliates or their respective officers, employees, legal advisors or
agents, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or the Transactions. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of Green and Blue shall liaise and cooperate with the other
Party and provide it with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or proposed response or compliance with any such request. If at
any time prior to the Shareholder Meeting (in the case of the

Blue and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the books and records and
personnel of Green; _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that the Party providing
access may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or
information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires such Party to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii)
access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of
waiving any attorney-client privilege other privilege applicable to such
documents or information (in which event the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to seek alternative means to disclose such information as nearly as
possible without affecting such attorney-client or such other privilege,
including entry into a joint defense agreement), or (iii) access to a
Contract to which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a Party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party
the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; _provided_
, _further_ , that such access shall be under the supervision of the
designated personnel or representatives of the Party providing access
(provided that no such supervision shall restrict or limit the scope and
extent of rights of a Party pursuant to this  _Section 6.8)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, to the extent practicable, all requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall be directed to such Person or Persons as
may be designated by the Party providing access, and the Party seeking access
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts not to directly contact any
other officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Party
providing access without the prior approval of such designated Person(s); and
_provided_ _further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by the Party
requesting access in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 6.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Party providing access set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to the Party
requesting access hereunder. In the event that a Party does not
provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall
use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to
the Party requesting access in a way that would not violate the applicable Law
or Contract or to waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.8_ shall be conducted
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct

 



71  of the business of the Party providing access or any of its Subsidiaries or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Party
providing access or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to such Partys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing without the such Partys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information obtained by any Party or any of its
financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and
other agents and representatives in connection with any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.8_. The
Party providing access shall reimburse the Party seeking access promptly for
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Party seeking access in

Section 6.9 _Regulatory Approvals; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) _Regulatory Approvals_. Each Party shall cooperate and promptly prepare
and file all necessary documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions and filings, and shall use reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things in
order to, (i) obtain all approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger
and the other Transactions, including the Blue Required Statutory Approvals
and the Green Required Statutory Approvals, (ii) make all registrations and

issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect thereto, and (v)
execute and deliver any additional agreements or instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. In furtherance of the obligations set forth in
_Section 6.9(a)_, each of Green and Blue agrees that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to take (and to cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to take) promptly any and all steps reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to obtain all approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other Transactions, including the Blue Required Statutory Approvals and Green
Required Statutory Approvals so as to enable the Parties to close the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable, including, if necessary,
by proposing, negotiating, committing to and implementing, by way of
operational restriction, consent decree, hold separate order, divestiture,
undertaking or otherwise, all terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations,
commitments, sanctions or undertakings in respect of Blue, Green and their
respective Affiliates; _provided_ that neither Blue nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall agree to, or accept, any additional or different
undertakings, agreements, commitments or conditions in connection with the
Transactions pursuant to any settlement,

 



72  negotiation, litigated proceeding or otherwise with any Person with respect
to obtaining the Blue Required Statutory Approvals and/or the Green Required
Statutory Approvals or any other approvals or authorizations described in the
foregoing sentence without the prior written consent of Green. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentences and subject thereto, Green
and Blue shall file as promptly as practicable a joint voluntary notice in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby under Exon-Florio.
Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in _Section 6.9(a)_ and this
_Section 6.9(b)_: (1) Green and Blue shall not be required, in
connection with obtaining any Blue Required Statutory Approvals or Green
Required Statutory Approvals, to agree or consent to or accept any terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments, sanctions or undertakings
as a condition to obtaining the Blue Required Statutory Approvals and the
Green Required Statutory Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, and
taking into account any positive effects, would have, or be reasonably likely
to have, a material and adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities,
properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of a
business that is 150% the size of, but otherwise identical to, Blue and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Burdensome Effect_ "). Nothing in
_Section 6.9(a)_ or this _Section 6.9(b)_ shall obligate Green or Blue or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action or agree to any
commitment that is not conditioned on the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party,
directly or indirectly through one or more of its Affiliates, shall take any
action, including acquiring or making any investment in any person or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Parties to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions. Any act or omission by an Affiliate of
Green or Blue that would be a violation of this _Section 6.9(c)_ if taken by
Green or Blue shall be a breach of this _Section 6.9(c)_ by Green or
Blue, respectively.

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, neither Green nor Blue
shall participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
discussion with any Governmental Authority (including any member of any
Governmental Authoritys staff) in respect of this Agreement, the Merger or
the other Transactions (including with respect to any of the actions referred
to in _Section 6.9(a)_ or, _Section 6.9(b)_) without providing prior notice
of any such meeting or discussion to the other, (ii) in the event a Party is
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
discussion, the other Party shall keep such Party reasonably and
promptly apprised with respect thereto, (iii) the Parties shall cooperate in
the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence
or other written communications explaining or defending this Agreement, the
Merger or the other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority, and (iv) to the extent reasonably practicable, each Party shall
provide the other Party copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications between it and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
(including any member of any Governmental Authoritys staff), on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions;
_provided_ that neither Party shall not be under an obligation to disclose
confidential information with respect to its Affiliates to the other Party.

 



73 Section 6.10 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting anything
contain in this Agreement, each of Blue and Green shall (i) take all action
within its power to ensure that no state anti-takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, take all action within its power to
ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.11 _Public Announcements_. The mutual announcement of the Agreement
and the Transactions shall be as agreed by Blue and Green and substantially
in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement. Green and Blue will
consult with each other before issuing, and will provide each other reasonable
opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, any other press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
written public statement prior obtaining the other Partys written
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (a) as the Parties or their respective Affiliates may be
required, at the advice of counsel, to do by applicable Law, court order or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange (in which case such party will, to the extent practicable, promptly
inform the other Parties in writing in advance of such compelled disclosure),
(b) with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change, and (c) as is
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Parties or otherwise in a manner consistent
with this _Section 6.11_; _provided_ , that, in each such case, to the
extent practicable, the Party intending to make such release shall use its
reasonable best efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult with the
other Party in advance of such release with respect to the text thereof. 

Section 6.12 _Listing Application_. Green shall prepare and submit to the NYSE
a listing application covering the Green Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to this Agreement. Each of Green and Blue shall furnish all information
concerning itself as may reasonably be required in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the listing application;  _provided_ , that
neither Party shall use any such information for any other purpose without the
prior written consent of the other Party or if doing so would violate or cause
a violation of United States other applicable securities Laws. Green shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Green Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.13 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Green and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation now
existing in favor of any current or former director or officer, or individuals
performing equivalent functions, of Blue or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to their activities as such prior to the Closing Date, as provided in
Blues Charter Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement and under
Connecticut law, shall survive the Closing and each of Green and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of

 



74  Blue or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
Blue would have been permitted under the Laws of the State of Connecticut
and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Green or the Surviving Corporation
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law;  _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set
forth under the Laws of the State of Connecticut and Blues certificate of
incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Blue shall and, if Blue is unable to, Green
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and
fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Blues current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as Blues policies existing on the date of this
Agreement with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Blue or Green
expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Blue for such insurance. If Blue and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Green shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for a period of not less than
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in Blues policies existing as of the date of this
Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Green shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in Blues policies existing as of
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Green or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid
by Blue for such insurance; and, _provided_ _further_ that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Green or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Green or the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.13_.

of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs,
executors or administrators.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.13_ shall be

certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Blue or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

information between the parties and other matters as the Transition Committee
deems appropriate. At all times after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time (or the earlier termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Article IX_ ), there shall be two (2) representatives of Green on the
Transition Committee that shall be designated by Green as the primary contact
person for Blue at Green (the " _Green Contact_ ") and two (2) representatives

event that either Green or Blue elects to request that the other consent to

Ventures as is contemplated by _Section 6.4_ or  _Section 6.5_, as
applicable, the Parties shall make all such requests to the Green Contacts or
the Blue Contacts, as applicable, and each Party agrees that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective contact to respond as
promptly as practicable to any such request, taking into account the nature of
the request, the circumstances under which the request is made and the timing
indicated in the request. The Green Contacts shall initially be Ignacio
Estella and Juan Romero (and may be changed by Green from time to time by
written notice from Green to Blue) and the Blue Contacts shall initially be
Richard Nicholas and Linda Randell (and may be changed by Blue from time to
time by written notice from Blue to Green).

prior to the Effective Time (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), Blue shall
promptly notify Green of any such Transaction Litigation and shall give Green
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement thereof. Blue

with Green Parent or one or more of its Affiliates regarding the provision of

as of the date of this Agreement and at costs no greater than those incurred
and reflected in the Green Financial Statements, as applicable (the " _Shared
Services Agreement_ "), it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of
doubt, that such costs are subject to ordinary course, market adjustments
made on an arms length basis. Prior to entering into such Shared Services

FEES AND EXPENSES

 

Section 10.1 _General_.

84 (b) The Parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section
10.1(d)_ and _Section 10.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that without these agreements, they would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Blue fails to pay promptly any amount payable by it pursuant
to  _Section 10.1(d)_ or _Section 10.2_, or if Green fails to pay promptly
any amount payable by it pursuant to _Section 10.2_, as the case may be, then

published in the Wall Street Journal plus three percent (3%) accruing daily

equal to $75,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); or

(ii) either Blue or Green terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_ (in each case, only if both (x) the condition set
forth in _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ was satisfied and remained satisfied to provide
Blue with adequate time to hold a Shareholder Meeting prior to such
termination and (y) the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained), _Section
9.1(f)_ or _Section 9.1(g)_, and, in any case, (A) prior to such termination,

Agreement is terminated, or (B) in the case of a termination by Green pursuant
to  _Section 9.1(d)_, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of termination of this Agreement (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day thereof). If the Termination Fee is due under _Section
10.1(d)(ii)_, it will be paid by wire transfer of same-day immediately
available funds on the date of the earlier of the consummation of or the entry
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. In no
event shall Blue be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once.

Section 10.2 _Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i)
_Section 9.1(f)_ or _Section 9.1(g)_, then Blue shall, promptly, but in no
event later than one (1) Business Day after the date of such termination and a
written demand by Green therefor, or (ii) _Section 9.1(e)_, then Green
shall, promptly, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the
date of such termination and a written demand by Blue, in either case, pay to

Transactions (including with respect to obtaining financing), in an amount

---|---|---|--- 

New Gloucester, ME and New Haven, CT  February 25, 2015  Iberdrola USA and
UIL Holdings Corporation (NYSE: UIL) today announced that they have entered
into a definitive agreement under which Iberdrola USA will acquire UIL
and create a newly listed U.S. publicly-traded company. The agreement, which
has been unanimously approved by both companies Boards of Directors, creates
a leading, diversified power and utility company in the Northeast. UILs
current President and Chief Executive Officer, James P. Torgerson, will
become the companys CEO upon closing.

The proposed transaction implies total value per share to UIL shareholders of
$52.75, including $10.50 per share paid in the form of cash, representing a
24.6% premium to UILs closing share price on February 25, 2015, and a 19.3%
premium to the average closing price over the past 30 days. The value of the
stock consideration received is based on the mid-point of the combined
companys estimated 2016 and 2017 earnings per share valued at peer P/E
multiples of 17.5x and 16.5x, respectively. This combination creates a larger, more diversified power and utility company
with seven highly-regarded regulated electric and gas utilities in
complementary geographies: Iberdrola USAs New York State Electric and Gas
(NYSEandG), Rochester Gas and Electric (RGandE) and Central Maine Power (CMP), and
UILs United Illuminating (UI), Southern Connecticut Gas (SCG), Connecticut
Natural Gas (CNG) and Berkshire Gas (BGC). The combined entity will have a
rate base of approximately $8.3 billion and expects to invest $6.9 billion in
regulated electric and gas infrastructure and other capital expenditures over
the next five years. The combined company will serve 3.1 million electric and
gas customers across New York, Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts. It will
also have a highly-contracted 6.5 GW primarily renewables portfolio, which
includes the second largest operating wind portfolio in the U.S., and a total
pipeline of over 6 GW.

A vast majority of Iberdrola USAs current renewable generation portfolio is
contracted to utilities under long-term agreements and approximately 95% of
the combined companys gross margin is projected to be derived from regulated
operations or contracted generation.

Ignacio Galan, Chairman of IBERDROLA, said: "The transaction integrates
Iberdrola USA and UIL, is consistent with Group strategy and creates a
significant company in the United States, a key market in which we are taking
a major step forward. It also reflects our preference for effecting friendly
corporate transactions."

 

"Iberdrola is an ideal long-term partner for our customers, our employees and
the communities we serve," said Mr. Torgerson, President and Chief Executive
Officer of UIL. "We will be a more diversified and stronger utility as a group
with greater scale and financial resources to support continued investment in
system reliability and infrastructure projects to ensure customers continue
to receive the safe, reliable and cost-efficient service that they have come
to expect from our top-performing companies. Our combined company will also
benefit from a shared commitment to industry excellence, high-quality customer
service and giving back to the communities we serve." Noting the geographic
concentration of regulated businesses in the Northeast, Mr. Torgerson added,
"The combined company will be able to draw upon even more resources to react
and respond to needs in any part of the system, especially in weather
emergencies."

"This is a very compelling transaction for our shareholders. The combination
will be immediately accretive to UILs cash flow profile and includes a $10.50
cash payment for each share currently owned," Mr. Torgerson continued.
"Shareholders will also participate in the future upside prospects of the
combined company, enabled by leveraging its balance sheet strength to pursue
additional investment opportunities in the Northeast and across the U.S., such
as its highly attractive renewable energy development portfolio."

 

Other Information

The combined companys robust financial profile will provide the financial
flexibility to aggressively pursue near- and long-term growth opportunities,
particularly in transmission and contracted wind. UIL will benefit from being
a part of a group with lower leverage and with immediate cash flow accretion,
supporting a strong investment grade credit rating and enabling the combined
company to execute a $6.9 billion, five-year regulated capital expenditure
program. Upon completion of the transaction, it is expected that long-term earnings per
share will grow by approximately 10% annually through 2019. The combined
company will initially set its dividend at UILs current quarterly dividend of
$1.728 per share, and will target a competitive dividend based on a 65% to 75%
payout ratio long-term.

 

Mr. Torgerson will become CEO of the combined company and will select and lead
a U.S.-based leadership team from among the UIL and Iberdrola USA
business leadership. Iberdrola and UIL will continue to have offices in New
Haven, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and New York.

At the close of the transaction, Mr. Torgerson, in addition to two current
UIL directors, will join Iberdrola USAs Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors for the newly-listed combined entity will consist of up to nine
Iberdrola USA directors.

 

The combined company will honor all existing labor agreements with UILs
unions and maintain UILs charitable giving and corporate
philanthropy programs.

decided by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting in person or by proxy by
the holders of shares entitled to vote therein. When a quorum is present at
any meeting, unless otherwise required by applicable law, NYSE Rules or these
Bylaws, any matter, other than the election of Directors and an advisory vote

executives required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, brought before
any meeting of Shareholders shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy in favor of such action by
the holders of shares entitled to vote therein. For the avoidance of doubt,
abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for such
purposes.

Shareholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of
the capital stock having voting power held by such Shareholder, but no proxy
shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that
it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A Shareholder may revoke
any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of
the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of
Shareholders need not be by written ballot. 
---|---|--- 



   13. | _Inspectors_. The Board, in advance of any meeting of
Shareholders, may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more
inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or
any adjournment thereof and make a written report thereof. The Board may
designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector
who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting,
the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding
and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the
meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity of proxies and ballots,
(c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable
period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination
by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the number of
shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots.
The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by
the Board, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for
each matter upon which the Shareholders will vote at a meeting shall be
determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at
the meeting. No ballot, proxies, votes or any revocation thereof or change
thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls
unless a New York State court upon application by a Shareholder shall
determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of Shareholders, the inspectors may consider such
information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate
for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.

GREEN STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT TERM SHEET

 

This Term Sheet (this " _Term Sheet_ ") summarizes the principal terms to be
incorporated into a Stockholder Agreement to be entered into by and between
Green and Green Parent in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 25,
2015, by and among Blue, Green and Merger Sub, to which this Term Sheet is
attached as Exhibit C (the " _Merger Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to them
in the Merger Agreement. This Term Sheet is subject in all respects to the
definitive Stockholder Agreement to be entered into between Green and Green
Parent at the Closing based on the principals set forth in this Term Sheet (it
being understood and agreed that Green and Blue shall negotiate in good
faith to agree to a definitive form of Stockholder Agreement prior to the

    Board Composition |  |

 Upon Closing, (a) the board of directors of Green (the " _Board_ ") will
initially be comprised of up to 12 directors and (b) the Board will initially
include three directors who were on the Blue Board immediately prior to
Closing, one of whom shall be the Blue Chief Executive Officer (and who will
become the Green Chief Executive Officer) and two of whom shall be selected by
Green from among Blues directors as of Closing (the " _Blue Directors_ ").
Except as otherwise provided herein or as provided by applicable legal and
regulatory requirements, for so long as Green Parent owns a majority of Green
shares, Green Parent shall be entitled to use its voting power to change the
size and composition of the Board from time to time in its sole discretion.

 



 For a period of three years after the Closing, the Board shall nominate,
and Green Parent shall cast all of its votes in favor of the election of, each
Blue Director that is not the Chief Executive Officer of Green, and shall not
vote to remove such Blue Directors. In the event of the resignation, removal
or death of any such Blue Director during such three-year period, such
directors replacement shall be nominated by vote of a committee of directors,
each of whom would, under applicable law and NYSE rules, be considered an
"independent director" of Green and Green Parent (assuming for such purpose
that such director is a director of Green Parent) (the " _Unaffiliated
Committee_ ") and Green Parent shall cast its votes in favor of the election
of such replacement.



 

 The composition of the Board and its committees will at all times satisfy
the requirements of applicable law and NYSE rules. 

   | 
  Minority Protections |  |

securities or warrants that may grant a right to acquire shares of Green, or
enter into any other contract or arrangement by virtue of which the economic
effect of ownership of Green shares is transferred, in each case directly or
indirectly (a " _Transfer_ "), for one year after the Closing (the " _Lockup
Period_ "), other than in a transaction in which Green Parent sells control of ---|---|---

Green and all Green shareholders are given the right to receive the same
consideration as Green Parent for their shares or, if such consideration is
not cash or a publicly traded security in the U.S., an equivalent cash amount;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for 6 months after the Lockup Period, Green
Parent shall only be permitted to Transfer shares of Green if the
Unaffiliated Committee, based upon advice from a nationally recognized
independent investment bank, approves such Transfer.



 

 Green Parent and its Affiliates shall not effectuate a "going private"

a majority of the shares of the stockholders not affiliated with Green.



 

 (i) Green Parent shall not cause Green to, and Green shall not enter into
a merger or similar combination of Green with a third party that results in
all stockholders of Green exchanging the Green stock for cash or stock of the
third party (or the survivor of such transaction) and (ii) for a period of
three years after the Closing, Green Parent shall not transfer 10% or more of
the outstanding Green common stock to a person or group of persons in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, unless in either case all
stockholders of Green are entitled to the same per share consideration to be
received in such transaction (in form and amount, except that if the
consideration is not cash or a publicly traded security in the U.S., an
equivalent cash amount) by Green Parent and its Affiliates for the same
proportion of their shares as Green Parent is disposing of in such transfer
or merger (in the case of clause (ii), pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer).

to specify the method of distribution of securities (including underwritten

 Green Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) will have the right
to require Green to file and maintain effective a shelf registration

 Green Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) will have piggyback
registration rights with respect to any registration proposed by Green,

with offerings to the extent necessary.

Subsidiaries and controlled Joint Ventures) at a higher cost to Green or its
Subsidiaries or controlled Joint Ventures than as reflected in the expenses

reasonably be expected to impair the executive officers of Green and its
Subsidiaries from conducting Greens (and its Subsidiaries) business or
operations in a manner consistent with such business or operations as of
immediately following the Closing. 

   | 
  Term |  |

 The Stockholder Agreement shall remain in effect for so long as Green
Parent and its Affiliates own greater than 20% of the outstanding voting stock
of Green; _provided_ that following any termination of the Stockholder

customary limitations and exceptions, including blackout periods reasonably
required by underwriters of Green securities offerings and limitations on the
number of demands that may be made in any given period of time) and (ii)
