STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
 

  


 

  

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), dated as of the 31st day of
December, 2012, is made by and among Middleby Marshall Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), VRC ACQUISITION COMPANY, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Purchaser"), VIKING RANGE CORPORATION, a Mississippi
corporation (the "Company"), and the shareholders of the Company set forth on
the signature pages hereto (each, a "Seller" and, collectively, the
"Sellers"). Parent, Sellers, the Company and Purchaser are sometimes referred
to herein as a "Party" or, collectively, the "Parties." Certain capitalized
terms used herein are defined in Annex A hereto.

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Shares"); and

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Sellers desire to sell the Shares to Purchaser, and the Purchaser
desires to purchase the Shares, all on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual agreements,
covenants, representations and warranties hereinafter contained, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

  

  

Section 1.1 Transfer of Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer and
convey the Shares to Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and the
Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept the Shares from the Sellers.

  

  

Section 1.2 Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment
and transfer to Purchaser at the Closing of the Shares, the Purchaser shall
pay or deliver to or on behalf of Sellers the sum of (i) (A) $350,000,000
minus (B) the amount of Indebtedness and other transaction expenses set forth
on Schedule A (the "Closing Payment"), plus (ii) the Escrow Amount, plus or
minus (iii) the working capital adjustment as contemplated by Section 1.5
hereof (such sum shall be referred to herein as the "Purchase Price").
Simultaneously with the Closing hereunder, Purchaser shall cause to be paid
the amount of Indebtedness and other transaction expenses set forth on
Schedule A (the "Pay-Off Amount").

  

  

Section 1.3 Closing. The closing of the transactions hereunder (the "Closing")
shall be effective as of the date hereof and shall occur simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, 155 N. Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60606 or on such other
date and at such other place as the Parties

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

may agree to in writing. The day on which the Closing actually takes place is
herein referred to as the "Closing Date". At the Closing, (i) the Sellers
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser the documents
identified in Section 7.1, (ii) the Purchaser shall deliver to or on behalf of
the Sellers the documents identified in Section 7.2 and the Closing Payment by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the
Sellers to the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, (iii) Purchaser shall
deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent and (iv) Purchaser shall deliver
the Pay-Off Amount in accordance with Schedule A.

  

  

Section 1.4 [RESERVED]

  

  

Section 1.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable (but not later than one-hundred twenty (120) days)
after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers, by notice in writing,
with its calculation of Working Capital, in reasonable detail as of the
Closing Date, and during such period Sellers shall cooperate fully with any
reasonable requests by Purchaser for information concerning Working Capital or
the components thereof. If Sellers do not object thereto within thirty (30)
days after receipt, by notice stating such objections in reasonable detail,
the same shall be deemed the "Definitive Closing Working Capital." If such
notice is timely given by Sellers, the Parties shall use their reasonable
efforts to reconcile such objections for a period of thirty (30) days
thereafter, and if they do so, their agreement as to Working Capital shall be
deemed the Definitive Closing Working Capital. If the Parties are unable to do
so, either Party may submit the items in dispute for determination as promptly
as practicable to Grant Thornton LLP, or if such firm is unavailable, an
internationally recognized accounting firm with no connection to Purchaser,
the Company or Sellers (i) to be agreed upon by Purchaser and Sellers, or if
they cannot so agree within fifteen days from a request by either Purchaser or
Sellers, (ii) appointed by the American Arbitration Association (the
"Arbitrating Accountants"). The costs of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be
allocated between the Sellers and the Purchaser in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of disputed items that were determined in favor of the
other Party (as finally determined by the Arbitrating Accountants) bears to
the total amount of disputed items submitted by the Parties, and the
determination of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be deemed the Definitive
Closing Working Capital which shall be final and binding on the Parties and
may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction. Each Party
shall bear its own legal fees and costs in connection with such arbitration.
For purposes hereof, "Working Capital" shall mean the difference between cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, plus inventory, plus prepaid
expenses and other current assets, on the one hand, less accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, on the other hand. Working Capital shall be calculated in
accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with Exhibit B.

  

  

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted based on the Definitive Closing
Working Capital as follows: (i) to the extent that the Definitive Closing
Working Capital is less than $13,900,000, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the
amount of such deficiency, or (ii) to the extent that the Definitive Closing
Working Capital is greater than $13,900,000, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers
the amount by which the Definitive Closing Working Capital exceeds such
amount; provided, however, that in no event shall any adjustment payable
pursuant to Section 1.5(b)(ii) result in a total Purchase Price that, after
subtracting the Pay-Off Amount, is greater than or equal to $248,000,000. Any
payment so required to be made by Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 1.5(b) shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds, not
more than five (5)

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Business Days after final determination thereof, to an account to be
designated by the payee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the due date.

  

  

Section 1.6 Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value-added, gross
receipts, stamp, registration or other similar transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the transfer and sale of the Shares as contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement, including all recording or filing fees, notarial fees
and other similar costs of Closing, shall be borne by the Sellers.

  


 

  

Section 1.7 [RESERVED]

  

  

Section 1.8 Withholding. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price payable hereunder, or other consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be timely and
properly paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Purchaser. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

to the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing would not (i) adversely affect the ability of the Company to carry
out its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement or (ii) have a material adverse effect. Section 2.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3

OTHER AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 4.1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Non-Competition.

  

  

(i) Each Seller that owns at least five percent (5%) of the total outstanding
Shares as of the date of this Agreement (each such Seller, a "Principal
Seller"), agrees and acknowledges that in order to assure the Purchaser that
the Business will retain its value as a going concern, it is necessary that
such party undertake not to utilize its special confidential knowledge of the
Business, the Company and its Subsidiaries and its relationship with clients
or customers to compete with the Purchaser. Each Seller further agrees and
acknowledges that the Business could be irreparably damaged if such party were
to engage in a business that sells, manufactures or distributes premium
products that are similar to the products in similar pricing categories that
the Company and its Subsidiaries sell, manufacture or distribute as of the
date of this Agreement, including without limitation, any of the companies set
forth on Schedule 4.1 (irrespective as to whether such companies listed on
Schedule 4.1 sell, manufacture or distribute premium products) (a "Competing
Business"). Therefore, as a significant inducement to the Purchaser to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to acquire the
Shares, each Principal Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years
after the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), no such party nor any
of its successors, assigns or Affiliates shall, anywhere in the world,
directly or indirectly, either for themselves or any other person, engage in,
own,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

operate, manage, control, invest in or participate in any manner or permit
their names to be used by, act as a consultant or advisor to, render services
for (alone or in association with any person), or otherwise assist in any
manner any person that engages in or owns, operates, manages, controls,
invests in or participates in, any Competing Business.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller shall be permitted to invest
in stock, bonds, or other securities of any public corporation so long as it
is not involved in the business of such corporation and provided (i) such
stock, bonds, or other securities are listed on any national or required
exchange; and (ii) its investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of
capital stock of any issuer, five (5%) percent of the issued and outstanding
shares, or in the case of bonds or other securities, five (5%) percent of the
aggregate principal amount thereof issued and outstanding.

  

  

(b) Non-Solicitation of Employees.

  

  

(i) Each Seller agrees that, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing
Date (the "Non-Solicitation Period"), neither it nor any of its successors,
assigns or Affiliates will directly or indirectly engage, recruit, solicit for
employment or engagement, offer employment to or hire, or otherwise seek to
influence or alter any relationship with, without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, any person who is (or was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the Closing Date) an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date unless such employee is terminated by the Purchaser or more
than one hundred eighty (180) days shall have passed since the employee's
voluntary termination of his or her employment by the Purchaser.

  

  

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 4.1(a), each
Seller hereby agrees that during the Non-Solicitation Period, neither it nor
any of its successors, assigns or Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (i) induce any Person which
is a customer of the Business, the Company, any Subsidiary or the Purchaser to
patronize any Competing Business; (ii) canvass, solicit or accept from any
Person who is a customer of the Business, the Company, any Subsidiary or the
Purchaser, any such competitive business; or (iii) request or advise any
Person who is a customer or vendor of the Business, the Company, any
Subsidiary or the Purchaser or their successors to withdraw, curtail or cancel
any such customer's or vendor's business with any such entity.

  

  

(c) Confidential Information. During the Non-Competition Period, each Seller
and its Affiliates shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and
shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, furnish, make
available or disclose to any third party or use for the benefit of himself or
any third party, any Confidential Information. As used in this Section 4.1(c),
"Confidential Information" shall mean any information relating to the business
or affairs of the Business, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser,
including, without limitation, to information relating to financial
statements, client or customer identities, potential clients or customers,
employees, suppliers, servicing methods, equipment, programs, strategies and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

information, analyses, profit margins or other proprietary information;
provided, however, that Confidential Information shall not include any
information which is in the public domain or becomes generally known in the
public domain through no wrongful act on the part of the Sellers or their
Affiliates. Each Seller acknowledges that the Confidential Information is
vital, sensitive, confidential and proprietary to the Business, the Company,
its Subsidiaries and the Purchaser.

  

  

(d) Limitations in Scope. Each Seller recognizes that the territorial, time
and scope limitations set forth in this Section 4.1 are reasonable and are
properly required for the protection of the Company's, its Subsidiaries', the
Business' and the Purchaser's legitimate interests in client relationships,
goodwill and trade secrets, and in the event that any such territorial, time
or scope limitation is deemed to be unreasonable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Purchaser and Sellers agree to submit to the reduction of
any or all of said territorial, time or scope limitations to such an area,
period or scope as said court shall deem reasonable under the circumstances,
and in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be
enforced.

  

  

(e) Equitable Remedies. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
set forth in this Section 4.1 are reasonable and necessary for the protection
of the Business and the Purchaser's business interests, its failure to comply
with any of the provisions of this Section 4.1 will cause irreparable harm to
the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Business and that in the
event of any Seller's or its Affiliate's actual or threatened breach of any of
the provisions contained in this Section 4.1, the Purchaser will have no
adequate remedy at law. As a result, each Seller agrees that in the event of
any actual or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth in this
Section 4.1, the Purchaser may seek equitable relief against such party and
its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, restraining orders and
injunctions, without having to show actual monetary damages or posting a bond,
as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the
Purchaser from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or
threatened breach, including, without limitation, the right to monetary
damages.

  

  

(f) Allocation. The Parties agree that for purposes of Section 4.5(i),
$1,000,000 of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Sellers' covenants
contained in this Section 4.1; provided, however, that the Parties also
acknowledge and agree that such allocation of the Purchase Price to such
covenants shall not limit the amount of damages that Purchaser may seek for
any breach of Sellers\' covenants contained in this Section 4.1.

  

  

Section 4.2 Publicity. Except as may be required by law or applicable listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, no Party nor any of their
Affiliates shall issue any press release or make any public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
approval of the other Parties.

  

  

Section 4.3 Further Assurances. After the Closing, the Parties shall, on
request, cooperate with one another by furnishing any additional information,
executing and delivering any additional documents and instruments, including
contract assignments, and doing any and all such other things as may be
reasonably required by the Parties or their counsel to consummate or otherwise
implement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

Section 4.4 Resignation of Officers and Directors. At or immediately following
the Closing, to the extent requested by Purchaser, Sellers will cause each of
the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to resign as an
officer and/or director effective as of the Closing.

  


 

  

Section 4.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Proration of Taxes. Except as provided in Section 1.6, the portion of any
Tax related to the Company or any Subsidiary payable with respect to a
Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of property and similar ad
valorem Taxes and any other Taxes not described in clause (ii) below, equal to
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that fall on or prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of
sales and similar Taxes, employment Taxes and other Taxes that are readily
apportionable based on an actual or deemed closing of the books, computed as
if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Refunds or Credits. Except as provided in Section 4.5(i), the Purchaser
shall promptly remit to the Sellers any refunds or credits of Taxes received
by the Company or any Subsidiary: (i) for any taxable year or taxable period
or portions of a taxable year (described in Section 4.5(a)) ending on or
before the Closing Date; or (ii) attributable to an amount paid by the Sellers
or for which the Sellers are responsible. The Purchaser shall be entitled to
all other refunds and credits of Taxes.

  

  

(c) Tax Returns. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and/or
cause to be filed in a timely manner all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than Straddle Periods)
which have not been filed as of the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with each of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' prior practice. At least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of
each such Tax Return, the Sellers shall provide the Tax Return to the
Purchaser for its review and comment and the Sellers shall consider in good
faith the Purchaser's comments to such Tax Return. The Sellers shall be
responsible for payment of any Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods. The
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and the Purchaser shall timely
file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns with respect of the Company and its
Subsidiary for Straddle Periods. At least thirty (30) days prior to the filing
of each such Tax Return with respect to Straddle Periods that relates to
income or franchise Taxes, the Purchaser shall provide copies of such Tax
Return to the Sellers for the Sellers' review and comment and the Purchaser
shall consider in good faith Sellers' comments to such Tax Return. For Tax
Returns relating to the Straddle Periods, the Sellers shall pay to the
Purchaser within fifteen (15) days before the date on which such Taxes are to
be paid the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date for which the Sellers are liable under this
Section 4.5.

  

  

(d) Cooperation. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate fully with each
other and with each Party's accounting firms and legal counsel, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 4.5 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes or pertaining to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority, and (ii) to give the Purchaser reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the Purchaser so request, the Sellers shall allow the Purchaser to
take possession of such books and records prior to such transfer, destruction
or discarding. The Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to retain any books
and records in its possession as of the date hereof with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to permit Sellers
and their representatives access to such books and records as may be requested
from time to time (and as is reasonably necessary) after the date hereof. The
Purchaser and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

(e) Contests. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Sellers
are liable under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall upon receipt of such
assertion, promptly, but no later than fifteen (15) days, inform the Sellers
in writing of such assertion and the Sellers shall have the right to control
any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such
claim, assessment or dispute except to the extent such proceedings or
determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which the Purchaser may be
liable under this Agreement, provided, that the Sellers may not settle any
such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent that such settlement will
affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary is liable
in subsequent periods without the consent of the Purchaser. Whenever any
Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes
the amount of Taxes for which the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary is
liable under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall have the right to control any
resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such
claim, assessment or dispute, except to the extent such proceedings affect the
amount of Taxes for which Sellers are liable under this Agreement. Whenever
any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise
disputes the amount of Taxes for which both the Sellers and Purchaser may be
liable: (i) each Party may participate in any resulting proceedings at its own
expense; and (ii) that portion of the proceedings shall be controlled by that
Party which would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the
adjustment and any corresponding adjustments.

  

  

(f) Seller Indemnification. The Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable
for, and shall indemnify and hold the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
and the Purchaser's Affiliates harmless against (without duplication), all
Losses and Taxes suffered by the Company, any Subsidiary, the Purchaser or any
of the Purchaser's Affiliates arising out of, incident to, or as a result of:
(i) the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 2.10 or Section 2.25 (it being acknowledged and agreed that for
purposes of this Section 4.5(f)(i), any exception set forth on Section 2.25(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be disregarded); (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Sellers contained in this Section 4.5; (iii) Taxes of or
attributable to the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes arising as a result of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement), but only to the extent such
Taxes were not included in the Definitive Closing Working Capital; (iv) Taxes
payable by the Company or any Subsidiary in any period by reason of the
Company or any Subsidiary being severally liable for the Tax of any Person
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous foreign,
state or local Tax law in any Pre-Closing Tax Period or pre-closing portion of
any Straddle Period, (v) any amount required to be paid by the Company or any
Subsidiary under an indemnification agreement (other than this Agreement) or
on a transferee or successor liability theory, in respect of any Taxes of any
Person, which indemnification agreement or application of transferee or
successor liability theory relates to an acquisition, disposition or similar
transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; and (vi) all Taxes
described in Section 1.6. Any claims hereunder shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 6.4.

  

  

(g) Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payment under this Section 4.5 or under
Article 6, to the extent such payment can be properly so characterized under
applicable Law, shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

  

  

(h) Survival of Obligations and Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties set forth in this
Section 4.5 shall be unconditional and absolute, shall survive until ninety
(90) days after the expiration of the applicable statutory reassessment or
appeal periods for the Taxes in question, having regard, without limitation to
(i) any waiver given by the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of the Taxes
in question and (ii) any entitlement of a Taxing Authority to assess or
reassess the Company or any Subsidiary without limitation in the event of
fraud or misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or willful
default. The rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes and Tax Returns
shall be governed solely by this Section 4.5 and not by ARTICLE 6.

  

  

(i) Section 338(h)(10) Election

  

  

(i) The Sellers, at the election of the Purchaser, shall jointly make a timely
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable elections
under state and local income tax Law) with the Purchaser with respect to the
Company (an "Election"). The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate in the
preparation and timely filing of (i) Forms 8023 with respect to the Election
and any comparable state or local forms or reports and (ii) to the extent
permissible by or required by Law, any corrections, amendments, or supplements
thereto. At the Closing, each of the Sellers shall execute and deliver to the
Purchaser Internal Revenue Code Form 8023 and any comparable state or local
forms that the Purchaser deems appropriate; provided, that the Purchaser shall
not be required to file any such form. To the extent necessary for the valid
filing of any such corrections, amendments, supplements, forms or reports, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate in the timely execution thereof.
Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser shall, or shall permit any of their
Affiliates to, take any action to modify any of the forms or reports
(including any corrections, amendments, or supplements thereto) that are
required for the making of the Election after their execution or to modify or
revoke any of the Election following the filing of the Forms 8023 without the
prior written consent of the other Party.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(ii) In connection with the Election, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, but in no event later than one hundred fifty (150) days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver: (i) a determination
of the "Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" and the "Adjusted Grossed Up Basis"
(each, as defined under applicable Treasury Regulations) with respect to the
Company and (ii) an allocation of each such Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and
Adjusted Grossed Up Basis among the assets of the Company, which allocations
shall be made in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and any applicable
Treasury Regulations (the "Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement"). If the
Purchaser and the Sellers cannot agree on the amount(s) and allocation(s)
described in the preceding sentence, such amount(s) and allocation(s) shall be
prepared by an independent accounting firm, other than their respective
regular independent accounting firms, mutually acceptable to the Parties, and
whose fees shall be borne equally. To the extent necessary, the Parties will
cause to be prepared and timely filed an amended Form 8883 for the Company and
Purchaser, as provided under Treasury Regulation §1.338-7, and such amended
Form 8883 shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Statement. Any Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement
prepared pursuant to this Section 4.5(i)(ii) shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Purchaser and each Seller.

  

  

(iii) The Purchaser and each Seller: (i) shall be bound by the determinations
of the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statements determined pursuant to Section
4.5(i)(ii) consistently therewith for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii)
shall prepare and file all Tax Returns to be filed with any Taxing Authority
in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statements and
(iii) shall take no position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statements in any Tax Return, any action before any Taxing
Authority or otherwise. In the event that a Section 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party receiving notice of
such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the other Party hereto
concerning resolution of such dispute.

  

  

(j) On the Closing Date, any tax sharing agreement or other similar
arrangement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party shall be
terminated and have no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether
a past, present or future year or period), and no additional payments shall be
made thereunder on or after the Closing Date in respect of redetermination of
Tax liabilities or otherwise.

  

  

Section 4.6 Sellers' Representative. Pursuant to the terms of three Sellers'
Representative and Paying Agent Agreements, a copy of each of which has been
delivered to Purchaser, (each, a "Sellers' Representative Agreement"), each
Seller has appointed either Fred E. Carl, Jr., Jackson Farrow, Jr., or Ronald
M. Clark (collectively, the "Sellers' Representatives" and each individually a
"Sellers' Representative") as such Seller's authorized representative and
agent and attorney-in-fact to act for, in the name of, and on behalf of such
Seller, with full authority to (a) take all actions to agree to, negotiate and
enter into settlements and compromises in any way relating to any and all
matters in which a Seller has rights or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation, the following
matters: (i) the definitive Closing Working Capital, (ii) the 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement, and (iii) any claim for indemnification by Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of Section 6.1 to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers' Representative in connection with
any of the foregoing, and (c) as otherwise provided in the Sellers'
Representative Agreement (the "TBA Matters"). A decision, act, consent or
instruction of a Sellers' Representative with respect to any of the TBA
Matters shall constitute a decision of the Seller who appointed the Seller's
Representative with respect thereto and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon such Seller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Sellers' Representative shall also have full power and authority, on behalf of
each Seller appointing their Sellers' Representative and such Seller's
successors and assigns, to interpret all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement related to the TBA Matters, to give and receive notices and
communications with respect thereto, to receive the Purchase Price from the
Purchaser, to make payments to service providers, to dispute, or fail to
dispute, any claim with respect to any TBA Matters made by Purchaser, to
negotiate and compromise any dispute which may arise under this Agreement
related to the TBA Matters, and to sign any releases or other documents with
respect thereto. In the event the Sellers' appoint a successor to a Sellers'
Representative pursuant to the terms of the applicable Sellers' Representative
Agreement, then written notice of such appointment shall be delivered to
Purchaser.

  


 

  

Section 4.7 Parent. Parent agrees to and does hereby unconditionally guarantee
the prompt payment and performance by Purchaser of all of its obligations
provided for in or arising under this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

Section 4.8 Use of Viking Name Promptly following Closing, the Sellers shall
cause Viking Aircraft, LLC and any other Affiliates of Sellers to cease
transacting business under or otherwise using for any purpose the name
"Viking" or any name similar thereto and shall take all actions necessary to
withdraw or terminate its authority to transact business anywhere under such
name within ten (10) Business Days after Closing, including without
limitation, filing an amendment to the governing documents of such entities to
change their names to a name dissimilar from "Viking".

  

  

ARTICLE 5

All representations and warranties made by Sellers or Purchaser in this

31  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

or warranties shall survive beyond such period with respect to any inaccuracy
therein or breach thereof, notice of which shall have been duly given within
such applicable period in accordance with Section 6.4 hereof, but only to the
extent that and for the time period necessary to resolve any claim for
indemnification arising from an asserted breach of the applicable
representation and warranty. The covenants and agreements contained herein
shall survive the Closing without limitation as to time unless the covenant or
agreement specifies a term, in which case such covenant or agreement shall
survive for such specified term.

  

  

ARTICLE 6

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 6.1 Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the provisions of this
ARTICLE 6, and except as provided in Section 4.5, each Seller agrees to
severally, in accordance with the Sellers' Indemnification Percentage, (except
with respect to the representations set forth in Section 2.31, in which each
Seller is solely liable for such Seller's representations) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser, its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates (each a "Purchaser Indemnitee" and together,
the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and in respect of, and to promptly pay to a
Purchaser Indemnitee or reimburse a Purchaser Indemnitee for, any loss,
Liability, damage, demand, claim, cost, suit, action or cause of action,
judgment, award, assessment, interest, penalty or expense (including
reasonable expense of investigations and fees and disbursements of counsel and
other professionals) (any of the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as a
"Loss" and collectively, the "Losses") suffered or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee on account of, arising from, or in connection with (i) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or
Sellers contained in this Agreement, (ii) the breach by the Company or Sellers
of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of the Company or Sellers
contained in this Agreement, (iii) any inaccuracy in any certificate,
instrument or other document delivered by the Company or Sellers as required
by this Agreement or (iv) those matters set forth on Schedule 6.1.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the Company or any Subsidiary be required to indemnify or hold any
Purchaser Indemnitee harmless under ARTICLE 6 after the Closing. Such
obligations shall be solely the obligations of Sellers.

  

  

Section 6.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of this
ARTICLE 6, Purchaser and Parent, jointly and severally, shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates from and in respect of, and
to promptly pay to any such party or reimburse such party for, any Losses
suffered or incurred by any such indemnified person for or on account of,
arising from, or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement and (ii)
the breach by Purchaser of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any inaccuracy in any
certificate, instrument or other document delivered by Purchaser as required
by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.3 Limitation on Liability. Except as provided in Section 4.5, in no
event shall Sellers be liable to any Purchaser Indemnitee (i) for any Losses
under Section 6.1(i) of this Agreement until the aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and then only to the extent
such Losses suffered by the Purchaser

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Indemnitees are in excess of the Basket Amount; provided, however, that the
foregoing limitations shall not apply to Losses incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty made in
or pursuant to Section 2.1 - Section 2.3, Section 2.6(b), Section 2.10,
Section 2.13(c), Section 2.29 or Section 2.31. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Sellers be liable to
any Purchaser Indemnitee under Section 6.1(i) or Section 6.1(iii) for any
Losses in excess of $35,000,000; provided, however, that with respect to
breaches of Section 2.13(c), Section 2.15, Section 2.17 and Section 2.21, or
any items specifically listed on Schedule 6.1 (except as otherwise indicated
on Schedule 6.1) such limitation shall be $60,000,000; provided, further, that
no such limitation shall apply to breaches of sections Section 2.1 - Section
2.3, Section 2.6(b), Section 2.10, Section 2.29 or Section 2.31.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Seller is individually liable for any breach of the representations set forth
in Section 2.31, and no Seller shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnitee for
any Losses relating to a breach of Section 2.31 by any other Seller.

  

  

Section 6.4 Procedures Related to Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Upon obtaining knowledge of any Loss, a person seeking to be indemnified
under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 (an "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give
a Notice of Claim to an indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") of any
Loss in respect of which such Indemnifying Party has a duty to indemnify such
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof (a "Claim"),
specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the nature of the Loss
for which indemnification is sought and, if practicable, the estimated amount
of such Claim, except that any delay or failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
to the extent, if at all, that it is materially prejudiced by reason of such
delay or failure.

  

  

(b) If a claim is brought or asserted by a third party (a "Third-Party
Claim"), the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof in good faith
by appropriate actions diligently pursued, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all
expenses. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in such Third-Party Claim and participate in such defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party, provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled, at the Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and expense, to retain one
firm of separate counsel of its own choosing (along with any required local
counsel) if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party so mutually
agree; (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails within a reasonable time to retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party; or (iv) the named parties in any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both sets of parties by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of such third party claim in accordance with this Section 6.4(b) within ten
(10) days after delivery of the Notice of Claim or fails to diligently pursue
the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party against which such third party
claim has been asserted shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and
settlement of such third party claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any resulting settlement of such

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

third party claim and for any final judgment with respect thereto (subject to
any right of appeal), if any, but only to the full extent otherwise provided
in this Agreement. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in
the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim in good
faith, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.
Anything in this Section 6.4 notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the Indemnified Party's written consent, settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Third-Party Claim which would have an adverse effect on the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Party may, without the Indemnified Party's written consent,
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any Third-Party Claim which requires solely money
damages paid by the Indemnifying Party, and which includes as an unconditional
term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

Section 6.5 Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies provided for in this
ARTICLE 6 shall be cumulative and shall not preclude any Party from asserting
any other right, or seeking any other remedies against the other Party.

  

  

Section 6.6 Setoff Rights. The Sellers hereby agree that the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to set-off against
Purchaser's payment obligations under this Agreement, the full amount of any
Losses required to be paid pursuant Section 6.1 hereof. From time to time, if
the Purchaser Indemnitees elect to exercise their set-off rights hereunder,
they must give Sellers written notice of such election no later than the date
the applicable payment was due and payable in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, which shall include the amount to be set-off, and upon giving
of such notice, the amount due in respect of such amount under this Agreement
shall automatically be reduced by the amount set forth in such notice. In the
event there is a "final determination" by a court of competent jurisdiction or
by an arbitrator, in the event arbitration is agreed to among the Purchaser
Indemnitees and Sellers, that the Purchaser was not entitled to
indemnification under Section 6.6 hereof with respect to the set-off amount,
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall promptly thereafter repay to the Sellers all
such amounts which are so determined to have been wrongfully set-off plus
interest accrued from the date the payment was due until actually paid at the
prime lending rate reflected in The Wall Street Journal during such period of
time. For purposes of this Section 6.6, a determination shall be "final" if
any and all appeals therefrom shall have been resolved or if thirty (30)
calendar days shall have passed from the rendering of such determination (or
of any determination on appeal therefrom) and no party shall have commenced
any such appeal therefrom.

  


 

  

Section 6.7 Escrow Agreement. Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Agent at Closing to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Amount,
together with any earnings or interest thereon, shall be applied to satisfy
indemnification obligations of the Sellers in accordance with the terms
hereof. Purchaser agrees that until the termination of the Escrow Agreement,
subject to Purchaser's rights under Section 6.6 hereof, it shall satisfy all
of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

its claims for indemnification hereunder by first making a claim pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.8 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payment under this ARTICLE 6, to
the extent such payment can be properly so characterized under applicable Law,
shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.
