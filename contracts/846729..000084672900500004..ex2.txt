                                   THE OFFER

         SECTION 2.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred
that, had the Offer referred to below been commenced, would give rise to a
right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in
Annex I hereto, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no
event later than 7 Business Days following the public announcement of the terms
of this Agreement, Parent, acting through Merger Subsidiary, shall commence an
offer (the "Offer") to purchase up to 50.1% of the Shares (the "Maximum
Amount"), together with the associated Rights, outstanding at a price of $28.13
per Share and associated Right (the "Offer Consideration"), net to the seller
in cash. The Offer shall remain open for a minimum of 22 Business Days, and
shall be subject to (i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration date of the
Offer and not withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares then
owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary, represents 50.1% of the Shares
outstanding (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other conditions set forth
in Annex I hereto. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any
of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer, provided that without the prior written consent of the
Company no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid
in the Offer or the Merger, decreases the price per Share and associated Right,
increases the Minimum Condition or the Maximum Amount, imposes conditions to
the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or amends any term or any
condition set forth in Annex I in a manner materially adverse to the holders of
the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Company,
Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to (i) waive the Minimum Condition and
(ii) extend the Offer (x) from time to time if, at the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have
been satisfied or waived (until such conditions are


                                       6
<PAGE>


satisfied or waived) for a number of days not to exceed 60 in the aggregate and
(y) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required
by applicable law. If at the expiration date of the Offer a number of Shares
has been validly tendered and not withdrawn that, together with the Shares then
owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary, exceeds the Maximum Amount, the
number of Shares to be purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Offer
shall be prorated in accordance with Rule 14d-8 promulgated under the 1934 Act,
so that the number of Shares purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the
Offer, together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
will represent 50.1% of the Shares outstanding. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Parent acting through Merger
Subsidiary will accept for payment and purchase, within the time period
required under applicable law, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer (subject to the pro ration described in
the immediately preceding sentence). Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Subsidiary on a timely basis funds necessary to purchase all
Shares that Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

          (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer (such Schedule TO and such documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and
to supplement the Offer Documents to include any information that shall become
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so
corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof
to the Company's shareholders.

         SECTION 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the
Offer and represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
held has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company's shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the



                                       7
<PAGE>


Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of Arkansas Law, and
(iii) subject to Section 7.03(b), unanimously resolved to (x) recommend
acceptance of the Offer to those shareholders of the Company who desire to
receive cash for their Shares and (y) following the acceptance for payment of
the Shares pursuant to the Offer, recommend the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by its shareholders. The Company further represents
that Credit Suisse First Boston (formerly Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corporation) ("CSFB") has delivered to the Company's Board of
Directors its written opinion that the Consideration to be received by the
holders of Shares is fair to the holders of Shares from a financial point of
view. The Company has been advised that all of its directors who own Shares
intend either to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer or to vote in favor
of the Merger. The Company will promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
record shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case true
and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent
such additional information (including updated lists of record shareholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer.

          (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws,
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to
Section 7.03(b), shall reflect the recommendations of the Company's Board of
Directors referred to above. The Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary each
agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and to supplement the Schedule 14D-9 to
include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given an opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the Company's shareholders.

          SECTION 2.03. Directors. (a) Effective upon the acceptance for
payment of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to
designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the
Company's Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of
directors on


                                       8
<PAGE>


the Company's Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary
(including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
outstanding (such directors to be allocated as evenly as possible among each of
the classes of directors of the Company) and the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company's Board of Directors, including increasing the number of directors or
seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. Parent's designees
shall serve as evenly as possible among the classes of the Company's Board of
Directors. At such time, the Company will also use its reasonable best efforts
to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members,
rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board and
(ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each
committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Board of Directors of the Company.

          (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and
shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require
in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent shall supply to
the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

          (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a
majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated
by Parent shall be required to (i) authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on
the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) any amendment or termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, any exercise of
rights or waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and (ii) take any other action
by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                                   THE MERGER

         SECTION 3.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, the Company shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into Merger Subsidiary in accordance with
Delaware Law and Arkansas Law, whereupon the separate existence of the Company
shall cease, and Merger Subsidiary shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

          (b) Subject only to Delaware Law and Arkansas Law, as soon as
practicable (but in no event later than two Business Days) after satisfaction
or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger,
(i) the closing of the Merger will take place at the offices of Parent in
Memphis, Tennessee and (ii) the Company and Merger Subsidiary will file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and articles of
merger with the Arkansas Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law and Arkansas Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time")
as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State
and the articles of merger are duly filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State
or at such later time as is specified in the certificate of merger and the
articles of merger.

          (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject
to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

         SECTION 3.02.  Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time:

         (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04,
each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent Stock
(rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) (such number, the "Exchange
Ratio") determined by dividing $28.13 by the Market Price per share of Parent
Stock. The "Market Price " per share of Parent Stock shall be the average
closing price per share of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(the "NYSE") at the end of the regular session as reported on the Consolidated
Tape, Network A for the ten trading days selected by Parent and the Company by
lot out of the 20 trading days ending on and including the fifth trading day
prior to the Effective Time (the "Random Trading Days"). Parent and the Company
shall select the Random Trading Days at 5:00 p.m. New York time on such fifth
trading day. The shares of Parent Stock to be received as consideration
pursuant to the Merger (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Stock as specified in



                                       10
<PAGE>



Section 3.07) are the "Merger Consideration", and the Merger Consideration,
together with the Offer Consideration, is the "Consideration";

         (b) each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than
Shares in an Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

          (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 3.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing
Shares (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make
available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send,
or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in
such exchange.

          (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented
by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.

          (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.


                                      11
<PAGE>


          (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article.

          (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income
earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged them for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the property of Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

          (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 3.07, shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Section. Following such surrender, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have
been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant
to Section 3.07 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of
such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and prior to surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such securities.

         SECTION 3.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has delivered to the Company, prior to the shareholder vote approving the
Merger, written notice of such holder's intent to demand payment for such
holder's Shares in accordance with Arkansas Law shall not be converted into a
right to receive the


                                      12
<PAGE>


Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to assert dissenters' rights. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to assert
dissenters' rights, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for the payment of Shares under dissenters' rights statutes, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

         SECTION 3.05. Stock Options. (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (1) each employee stock option or director stock option to
purchase Shares outstanding under any Company Plan or Director Plan, whether or
not vested or exercisable (each, a "Company Option") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and deemed to constitute an option (each, a "Parent Option")
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Option (subject to Section 3.05(b)), the same number of shares of
Parent Stock as the holder of such Company Option would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.02(a) of this Agreement had such holder exercised
such Company Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded to
the nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded down to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the Shares otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Company Option divided by (y) the number of whole
shares of Parent Stock purchasable pursuant to the Parent Option in accordance
with the foregoing, (2) each share appreciation right issued under any Company
Plan or Director Plan (each, an "SAR") shall be terminated and payment therefor
shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Plan and (3) Parent shall
assume the obligations of the Company under the Company Plans and the Director
Plans, each of which shall continue in effect after the Effective Time, and all
references to the Company in such plans, and any option granted thereunder,
shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where appropriate. The other terms of each
such Company Option, and the plans under which they were issued, shall continue
to apply in accordance with their terms.

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) obtain any
consents from holders of Company Options and (ii) make any amendments to the
terms of such Company Options or Company Plans that, in the case of either
clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary or appropriate to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by Section 3.05(a); provided, however, that lack of
consent of any holder of a Company Option shall in no way affect the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take


                                      13
<PAGE>


such actions and make any amendments to the Director Plans necessary or
appropriate to cause the Company Options outstanding thereunder to (x) not
terminate at the Effective Time, (y) continue to remain outstanding and vest in
accordance with their terms and (z) in the case any holder of such Company
Options ceases to be a director for any reason, expire in accordance with their
respective terms without regard to any provisions in the Director Plans which
provide for an earlier expiration date.

          (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Parent Options. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to such Parent Options.

          (d) Neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall assume or
substitute equivalent options under the Company's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "ESPP"). Accordingly, pursuant to Section 19(c) of the ESPP, as of
the 15th day prior to the Effective Time, the Offering Period (as defined in
the ESPP) then in progress under the ESPP shall terminate. The Company shall
notify each participant in the ESPP in writing of the New Exercise Date (as
defined in the ESPP) for such Offering Period. All shares purchased under the
ESPP and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be treated under this
Article 3 in the same manner as other Shares outstanding as of the Effective
Time. The Offering Period ending as of the 15th day prior to the Effective Time
shall be the final Offering Period under the ESPP and the ESPP shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time.

         SECTION 3.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
distribution thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

         SECTION 3.07. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Stock but for
this Section shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which
payment shall represent such holder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holder of the
aggregate fractional shares of Parent Stock that such holder otherwise would be
entitled to receive. Any such


                                      14
<PAGE>


sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five Business Days after the
date upon which the Certificate (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that
would otherwise result in the issuance of such fractional shares of Parent
Stock have been received by the Exchange Agent.

         SECTION 3.08. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

         SECTION 3.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as is customarily required by Parent and the Exchange
Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article.

                                   ARTICLE 4
             THE SURVIVING CORPORATION, CERTAIN GOVERNANCE MATTERS

         SECTION 4.01. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law; provided that, at the Effective Time, Article 1
of such certificate of incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The
name of the corporation is American Freightways Corporation".

          SECTION 4.02. Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable law.

          SECTION 4.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with


                                      15
<PAGE>


applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

         SECTION 4.04. Parent Board of Directors. At the Effective Time, the
board of directors of Parent shall consist of 13 directors, of whom one shall
be Mr. F.S. Garrison (the "Company Board Designee") and the remainder of whom
shall be directors of Parent prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall take all action
necessary to increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent as necessary
and to elect the Company Board Designee to the Board of Directors of Parent as
a class II director, in each case as of the Effective Time.

         SECTION 4.05. Company Headquarters. It is the intention of Parent to
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain a significant presence in Harrison,
Arkansas and to continue to employ approximately the same number of employees
of the Company as are employed at the Effective Time, subject to the Surviving
Corporation's right to make continuing personnel decisions in the ordinary
course of business.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:

         SECTION 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Arkansas and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.



                                      16
<PAGE>


         SECTION 5.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's corporate powers and,

         SECTION 5.16. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 5.16 of the Company

supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or
retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life
insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered or contributed to by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate and covers any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of such plans (and, if
applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all
amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof have been furnished to
Parent together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in
connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans are referred to collectively
herein as the "Employee Plans".

          (b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor
thereof sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or
has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such


                                      26
<PAGE>


determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware
of any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked. The Company
has made available to Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee
Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Plan. No material events have occurred with respect to any Employee
Plan that would result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of
any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B,
4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

          (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,
would entitle any employee or former employee to any severance or other payment
solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, or would give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms
of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

          (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
in respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

          (g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee
Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee
Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1999.

          (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a labor
union or organization.

         reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;
         or

        (iii) Liens which do not materially detract from the value of such Real
         Property, or materially interfere with any present or intended use of



                                      29
<PAGE>





         such Real Property or Liens, the existence of which, individually or

          (b) All leases of Real Property are in good standing and are valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and there
does not exist under any such lease any default or any event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, except where such failure

aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

         SECTION 5.21. Insurance Coverage. The Company has furnished to Parent
a list of, and true and complete copies of, all insurance policies and fidelity
bonds relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the conduct of its
business. There is no material claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending under any of such policies or bonds for which adequate reserves have
not been established and as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds or in respect of which
such underwriters have reserved their rights. All premiums payable under all
such policies and bonds have been timely paid and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have otherwise complied fully with the terms and conditions of all
such policies and bonds. Such policies of insurance and bonds (or other
policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage) remain
in full force and effect. Such policies and bonds are of the type and in
amounts customarily carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to the
business conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company does not
know of any threatened termination of, premium increase with respect to, or
material alteration of coverage under, any of such policies or bonds. After the

have coverage under such policies and bonds with respect to events occurring
prior to the consummation of the Offer.

not assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered, all trademarks, trade
names, service marks or logos except for such trademarks, trade names, service
marks or logos the failure of which to own or have rights to use individually
or in the aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

          (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns outright or holds
valid and enforceable licenses to all copies of the operating and applications
computer software programs and databases material to the conduct by the



                                      30
<PAGE>



Company and its Subsidiaries of their respective businesses (other than
programs and databases that are generally commercially available) as of the
date hereof (collectively, the "Company Software") except for such Company
Software the failure of which to own or validly license individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. To the Company's knowledge, none of the Company Software used by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and no use thereof, infringes upon or
violates any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of any
other Person and, to the Company's knowledge, no claim with respect to any such
infringement or violation is pending or threatened, except for any such
infringement or violation which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Company Software sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business after the date hereof, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) will continue to own or hold all the Company Software free and
clear of all claims, Liens, obligations and liabilities and (ii) with respect
to all agreements for the lease or license of Company Software which require
consents or other actions as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in order for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
continue to use and operate such Company Software after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall have obtained such consents
or taken such other actions so required prior to the date of consummation of
the Offer, except for such claims, Liens, obligations and liabilities which,
and consents or actions that if not obtained or taken, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection

the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an

confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf

Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares on terms

majority vote, on the basis of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable to the Company

action that would reasonably be likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code ("368(a)
Reorganization") and prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use their best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a

          breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of
          the Offer to be consummated by such date;

               (ii) there shall be any law or regulation that makes acceptance
          for payment of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer, or
          consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any
          judgment, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental
          body having competent jurisdiction permanently enjoining Merger
          Subsidiary from accepting for payment of, and paying for, the Shares
          pursuant to the Offer or Merger Subsidiary, Company or Parent from
          consummating the Merger and such judgment, injunction, order or
          decree shall have become final and nonappealable; or

               (iii) prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares under
          the Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to
          make, withdrawn, or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, its
          approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the
          Merger, as permitted by Section 7.03(b)(iv); provided that the
          Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to Sections 12.04(b)
          and (c) in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified
          therein, and provided, further, that, in the case of any termination
          by the Company, (x) the Company notifies Parent promptly in writing
          and at least 72 hours prior to such termination, of its intention to
          terminate this Agreement and to enter into a binding written
          agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
          Superior Proposal of the nature described in Section 7.03(c),
          attaching the most current version of such agreement (or a
          description of all material terms and conditions thereof), and (y)
          Parent does not make, within 72 hours of receipt of such written
          notification, an offer that the Board of Directors of


                                      50
<PAGE>


         the Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its
         financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of
         the Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the
         Company shall not enter into any such binding agreement during such
         72-hour period; or

          (c) by Parent, if prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares
under the Offer, there has been a breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is not curable
and such breach would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in (c)
of Annex I hereof; or

          (d) by the Company, if prior to the acceptance for payment of the
Shares under the Offer there has been a breach by Parent of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is not curable
and such breach would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in (c)
of Annex I hereof (which, for purposes of this Section 11.01(d) only shall
apply mutatis mutandis to Parent).

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01
(other than pursuant to Section 11.01(a)) shall give notice of such termination
to the other party.

         SECTION 11.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party (or any shareholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the
other party hereto, provided that (x) if such termination shall result from the
willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to
perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of
such failure and (y) in any event, the provisions of Sections 9.04, 12.04,
12.06, 12.07 and 12.08 shall survive any such termination.

         SECTION 12.03. Amendments; No Waivers. (a) Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each
party against whom the waiver is to be effective, provided that, after the
adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company and without their
further approval, no such amendment or waiver shall reduce the amount or change
the kind of consideration to be received in exchange for the Shares in the
Merger.

          (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

          SECTION 12.04. Expenses. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Section, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

         (b) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company
shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), if,
pursuant to (x) below, simultaneously with the occurrence of such Payment Event
or, if pursuant to (y) below, within two Business Days following such Payment
Event, a fee of $33,000,000.

         "Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.01(b)(iii) or (y) the occurrence of any of the following events
within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections
11.01(b)(i) or 11.01(c) (and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal
relating to the Company has been made to the Company or to the shareholders of
the Company by any Person): (i) the Company merges with or into, or is
acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a Third Party;
(ii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the total
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) a Third
Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the outstanding
Shares; or (iv) the Company adopts or implements a plan of liquidation,
recapitalization or share repurchase relating to more than 50% of the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (c) Upon any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Sections 11.01(b)(iii) or
11.01(c), the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates (by wire
transfer of



                                      53
<PAGE>


immediately available funds), no later than two Business Days after such
termination, for 100% of their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel) actually incurred by
any of them in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

          (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly
to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 12.04, it shall also
pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount.

         SECTION 12.05. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or
Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to purchase all or a portion
of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, but no such transfer or assignment will
relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under the Offer or
prejudice the rights of tendering shareholders to receive payment for Shares
validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

          SECTION 12.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

         SECTION 12.07. Jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware
state court, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the


                                      54

foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

         SECTION 12.08.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         SECTION 12.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Benefit. This Agreement
may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party
hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other
parties hereto. Except as provided in Section 8.04, no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

         SECTION 12.11.  Captions.  The captions herein are included for
convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or
interpretation hereof.

         SECTION 12.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

         SECTION 12.13.  Specific Performance.  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be



                                      55

the circumstances (including any action or omission by Parent but excluding any
willful action or omission by Parent not permitted or contemplated by the
Merger Agreement) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to
proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment.
