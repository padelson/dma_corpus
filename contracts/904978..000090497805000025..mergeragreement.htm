 D. The Board of Directors of Parent has (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and (iii) determined to recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the issuance of the Restricted Parent Common Stock (as defined below) in connection with the Merger.

Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Stockholders and any person becoming a stockholder of Company prior to the Effective Date (as defined herein) shall execute and deliver the Stockholders Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Stockholders Agreement") and the Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Registration Rights Agreement" and, together with the Stockholders Agreement, the "Ancillary Agreements"). 

 

 F. The parties hereto intend that the Merger be treated as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the Code.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined below) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company (the "Merger"), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Company as
the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation."

 

 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of DGCL (the "Merger Documents") (the time of such filing being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as herein defined). The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of O\'Melveny and Myers LLP, Times Square Tower, 7 Times Square, New York, New York, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1(a)_ ,  _6.1(c)_ , _6.2(c)_ and _6.3(c)_ or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

 

 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all without further act or deed.

 

 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

 

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, to serve until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, to serve until their respective successors are duly appointed.

 

 1.6 _Escrow Agreement_. Parent shall establish and maintain an escrow (the "Escrow Account") comprised initially of 1,561,875 shares of Restricted Parent Common Stock, as adjusted for splits, reverse splits, stock dividends, subdivisions, reclassifications, exchanges, recapitalizations and the like (as so adjusted, the "Escrow Stock"), and shall designate and appoint U.S. Trust Company of California or such other escrow agent that is acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders Agent (as defined in the Stockholders\' Agreement) in connection therewith (the "Escrow Agent") to serve in accordance with the Escrow Agreement attached as Exhibit C hereto (the "Escrow Agreement") to be entered into by and among Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders Agent at Closing. Any disbursements of the Escrow Stock to Parent or any

  aggregate Merger Consideration under this Agreement.

 

 1.7 _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration (the "Merger Consideration") payable as a result of the Merger to all holders of Company\'s outstanding capital stock (the "Stockholders") shall be 8,871,890 shares of Restricted Parent Common Stock, as adjusted for splits, reverse splits, stock dividends, subdivisions, reclassifications, exchanges, recapitalizations and the like.

 

 1.8 [Reserved].

 

 1.9 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be distributed by Parent as follows:

 

 (a) The Escrow Stock shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.6_ ; and

 

 (b) Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.11_ below (including, without limitation, the provisions regarding surrender and exchange of stock certificates), the number of shares of the Restricted Parent Common Stock remaining after deduction of the Escrow Stock will be delivered to the Stockholders.

 

 1.10 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of Company\'s securities, options or warrants, the following shall occur:

 

 (a) _Conversion of Company Stock; Distribution of Merger Consideration to the Stockholders_. All issued and outstanding shares of each class of Company\'s capital stock (collectively, the "Company Stock"), other than shares, if any, held by persons who have not voted such shares for approval of the Merger and have perfected dissenters\' rights in accordance with Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares"), shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be distributed pursuant to _Section 1.9_ , in the amounts and/or percentages set forth on _Schedule I_ (the "Distribution Percentages"). Company covenants and agrees that it will provide an updated and final _Schedule I_ no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing that reflects the Distribution Percentages that will apply at the Closing. All Company Stock that is owned by Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

 

 (b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Shares_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and thereafter represent the corresponding number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so that all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation are owned by Parent immediately following the Closing.

 

 (c) _Conversion of Company Stock Options_. Each outstanding Company Stock Option shall be converted to an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, as set forth in _Section 4.9_.

  (d) _Dissenters\' Rights_. Any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law. Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under Delaware Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such purchase demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares ("Dissenting Stockholder") who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware Law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Company Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions) in accordance with Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall deliver, upon surrender by such Stockholder of a certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Stock, the amount of Merger Consideration to which such Stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this _Section 1.10_.

 

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Restricted Parent Common Stock will be issued to Stockholders in connection with the Merger. The number of Restricted Parent Common Stock issuable to a Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction thereof (after aggregating all fractional shares to be received by such Stockholder) shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number. In lieu of fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Average Stock Price.

 

 1.11 _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 (a) _Exchange Procedures At Closing_. At Closing or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Stockholders shall deliver to Parent certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") (or an indemnity of lost certificate(s) in accordance with _Section 1.13_ ) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represent outstanding shares of Company Stock which shares shall be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration. Each Certificate shall be duly endorsed for transfer and shall be accompanied by all other documents reasonably required by Parent to effect the transfer of the Certificate (and underlying shares) to Parent for cancellation. Parent shall promptly deliver to each Stockholder who has so delivered such Certificates and such other documents (and who shall otherwise be eligible to receive Merger Consideration under this Agreement), the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares represented by such Certificates.

 

 (b) _Exchange Procedures Subsequent To Closing_. To the extent that any Stockholder fails to deliver at Closing Certificates (or an indemnity of lost certificate(s) in accordance with _Section 1.13_ below), until surrendered to Parent, any such Certificate will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration issuable in exchange for Company Stock represented by such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 (c) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this _Section 1.11_ shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of Parent under this 

  _Section 1.11_ shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the
holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares
the amount of Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 (d) _Withholding Rights_. To the extent that any portion of the Merger Consideration is paid in cash, Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such Merger Consideration such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

 

 (e) _No Liability_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, shall be liable to any Stockholder for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

 1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. On the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such time, Certificates are presented to Parent or Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

 

 1.13 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares as the holder thereof may be entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in their respective sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

 

 1.14 _Parent\'s Board of Directors_. As of the Effective Time, (a) Parent shall increase the size of its Board of Directors (the "Parent Board") to enable it to appoint Michael Foster and John Hindelong (the "Director Designees") as members of the Parent Board and (b) the Parent Board shall appoint each of the Director Designees to the Parent Board, to serve in such capacities until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Parent and the Stockholders Agreement.

 

 1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company, the officers and directors of Company and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

All such policies are in full force and effect in all material respects and to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that would, by the terms of the policy, give any insurance carrier a right to terminate any such policy prior to its expiration.

 4.3 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

 

 (a) The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have previously executed a mutual nondisclosure agreement, dated as of January 11, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

 (b) Each of Company and Parent will afford the other and the other\'s accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business as such other party may reasonably request, including, without limitation, the monthly financial statements of each party, which shall be delivered to the other party no later than forty (40) days after the conclusion of each calendar month. Any investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize the interference with the operation of each party\'s business. Neither party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate the rights of any customer, would contravene any Applicable law, or would waive any privilege. The parties will use reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of any such restrictions (other than waivers of the attorney-client privilege) and in any event make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. All information furnished by the parties hereto previously in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating the Merger contemplated hereby and shall be treated as the sole property of the party delivering the information until consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby and shall, in all respects, be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement previously entered into between Parent and Company. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this

  _Section 4.3_ will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger.

 

 (c) No party or its representatives shall contact any of the employees, customers, licensors, licensees or strategic partners of, or other having business dealings with, the other party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written authorization of the other party.

 

 4.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ , Company will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, Affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 4.4_ by any officer or director of Company or any investment banker or attorney of Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.4_ by Company.

 

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to any Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from Company by any Person of voting securities of Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 5% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Company; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of any material portion of the assets of Company; or (C) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of Company.

  material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed
in all material respects of the status and details (including material
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry.

 

 4.5 _Public Disclosure_. Parent and Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case reasonable efforts to consult with the other party will be made prior to any such release or public statement.

 

 4.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.

 

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities (including, without limitation, the HSR Act) and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent, Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

  (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is required to be disclosed pursuant to this _Section 4.6(b)_ requires any change in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or if any such event, condition, fact or circumstance would require such a change assuming the Company Disclosure Schedule were dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, then Company shall promptly deliver to Parent an update to the Company Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. No such update shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of determining (i) the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by Company in this Agreement and (ii) whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied.

 

 (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is required to be disclosed pursuant to this _Section 4.6(c)_ requires any change in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or if any such event, condition, fact or circumstance would require such a change assuming the Parent Disclosure Schedule were dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, then Parent shall promptly deliver to Company an update to the Parent Disclosure Schedule specifying such change. No such update shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Parent Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of determining (i) the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement and (ii) whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied.

 

 4.7 _Third Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, each of Company and Parent shall (i) obtain all consents, waivers and approvals pursuant to the terms and conditions of its or any Subsidiary\'s respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases listed in _Section 4.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule ("Material Consents"), respectively and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any other consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or any Subsidiary\'s respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for those consents, waivers and approvals as to which the failure to obtain would not affect the consummation of the Merger or the performance of the Ancillary Agreements or would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company or Parent.

 

 4.8 _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Company intend that the shares of Restricted Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.7_ in connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder, as a private placement pursuant either to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or such other exemption (if any) from the registration 

  satisfactory to both Company and Parent. Parent has agreed to provide the
Stockholders with registration rights with respect to such Restricted Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

 

 4.9 _Stock Options_. The Company shall take or cause to be taken such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock granted with an exercise price in excess of one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per share (each, an "Underwater Company Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, to be cancelled prior to the Effective Time without payment of any consideration to the holders of the Underwater Company Stock Options. If necessary, such actions shall include obtaining the consent of the holders of the Underwater Company Stock Options to such cancellation. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock other than the Underwater Company Stock Options (each, an "Assumed Company Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by Parent. Each Assumed Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and to be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such options immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Assumed Company Stock Option will be or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares of Company Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by forty-seven thousand, twenty-two ten-thousandths (0.4722) (the "Option Exchange Rate"), and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock will be the per share exercise price of the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Within thirty (30) days following Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an Assumed Company Stock Option a written notice setting forth (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Stock Option and (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Company Stock Option. Parent agrees to (i) reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Assumed Company Stock Options; (ii) file all documents required to be filed to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Company Stock Options to be listed on the NASDAQ National Market; and (iii) file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Assumed Company Stock Options promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter. It is intended that Assumed Company Stock Options shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Assumed Company Stock Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this Section 4.9 shall be applied consistent with such intent. Options to acquire 219,800 shares of Company Stock, which were granted to the Company\'s officers and employees pursuant to the Company\'s 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, are intended to qualify as incentive stock options.

 

 4.10 _Employees_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent and/or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) shall give each employee of Company or its Subsidiaries who continues as an employee of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent and becomes a participant in an employee benefit plan of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, credit, to the extent permitted by such

  Effective Time for purposes of vesting and eligibility (but shall not give
benefit accruals with respect to service with Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) and for purposes of determining
benefits levels under any Parent Plan relating to vacation or severance,
except where such crediting would result in a duplication of benefits. If
requested by Parent no later that three (3) Business Days before the Closing
Date, Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to cause any
plan qualified under Code Section 401(k) maintained by Company or its
Subsidiaries to have a termination date prior to the Closing Date. The
executives and officers set forth in Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall receive the severance protections set forth in such schedule.
Nothing in this _Section 4.10_ shall be deemed to constitute an employment
contract between the Surviving Corporation and any individual, or a waiver of
the Surviving Corporation\'s right to discharge any employee at any time, with
or without cause, subject to the terms of any employment agreement with such
employee.

 

 4.11 _Restrictions on Parent_.

 

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ , Parent shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries or its officers, directors or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them (collectively, the "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or requiring Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from furnishing information (public or non-public) to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes a Parent Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by Parent in breach of this _Section 4.11(a)_ or taking any of the actions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above with any person after receipt of a Parent Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by Parent in breach of this _Section 4.11(a)_ , if the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take any of the actions above would create a reasonable possibility of a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under Applicable Law; _provided_ that Parent (x) will not, and will not permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries or Parent\'s and the Parent Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such person without first entering into an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) with such person and (y) will promptly provide to Company any non-public information concerning Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries provided to such other person which was not previously provided to Company. Parent shall provide prompt (but in no event more than 24 hours after receipt of the Parent Acquisition Proposal) written notice to Company of (1) the receipt of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and any modification or amendment to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, (3) the identity of such person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and (4) Parent\'s intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such person. Parent shall continue to keep Company informed 

  shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and Parent\'s and the Parent
Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity,
discussion or negotiation with any person conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement by Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or such Representatives with
respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Parent Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from Parent by any Person of voting securities of
Parent or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 50% or more of
the total outstanding voting securities of Parent or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Parent;
(B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition
or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (C) any liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acceptable Parent
Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that contains
provisions which are no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 (b) If prior to the Parent Meeting at which the proposal to approve the issuance of the Restricted Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger is to be voted upon, the Parent Board determines in good faith that it is consistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders under Applicable Law, the Parent Board may inform Parent\'s stockholders that it no longer believes that the issuance of the Restricted Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval (a "Parent Subsequent Determination"), but only at a time after the fifth Business Day following Company\'s receipt of written notice advising Company that the Parent Board is prepared to so inform Parent\'s stockholders. During such period, Parent shall provide an opportunity for Company to propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Parent Board to proceed with its recommendation to its stockholders without a Parent Subsequent Determination.

 

 4.12 _Charter Indemnification Provisions_. Parent agrees that the directors and officers of Company and each of Company\'s Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to the same indemnification rights for acts occurring prior to the Effective Time as they had under the Company Charter Documents and the similar organizational documents of each of Company\'s Subsidiaries, or under any agreements or instruments with Company or any of Company\'s Subsidiaries described in _Section 4.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Effective Time. Merger Sub and Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force and effect such rights for a period of at least six years from the Effective Date and (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to perform, in a timely manner, all of the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations with respect thereto. Parent and Merger Sub agree that any claims for indemnification under this _Section 4.12_ as to which written notice has been received by the Surviving Corporation prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall survive indefinitely, whether or nor such claims have been finally adjudicated or settled. This _Section_

  such director and officer and their respective heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

 4.13 _Tax_.

 

 (a) Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither the Stockholders, Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent it may affect or relate to Taxes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required to comply with Applicable Law, make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other action related to Taxes.

thereof) of any Tax Return relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, and shall also have the right to participate in, at Company\'s

Each of Company and Parent agree that if such party becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, it will promptly notify the other party in writing of such fact or circumstance. Each of Company and Parent will comply with all reporting and record-keeping obligations set forth in the Code and the Treasury regulations that are consistent with the Merger qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 **ARTICLE V 
 SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

 5.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.** All of the representations and warranties contained in _Article II_ and _Article III_ shall survive Closing until the second anniversary of the Closing Date. Any right to indemnification or other recovery under this _Article V_ shall only apply to Losses with respect to which the applicable Indemnitee shall have notified the indemnitor within the applicable time period set forth in this _Article V_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that for Losses relating to Taxes, an Indemnitee may claim a Loss if a reasonable basis exists for the assertion of a Tax claim that would otherwise be indemnifiable (but for the expiration of the survival period or termination of the Escrow Account) and a claim is submitted for such possible Loss on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with the requirements of the Escrow Agreement. This _Section 5.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties that contemplates performance after the Closing Date.

 

 5.2 _Indemnification Obligations of the Stockholders_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_ below, the Stockholders and their successors and assigns shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company), stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees") from and after Closing, in respect of any Loss which any Parent Indemnitees suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of or by virtue of, without duplication:

 

 (a) the breach by Company of any of the covenants made by the Company in this Agreement or any certificates delivered in connection herewith; or

  (b) the breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of Company contained in this Agreement or any certificates delivered by Company in connection herewith.

 

 5.3 _Indemnification Obligations of Parent_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_ , Parent and its successors and assigns shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, officers, managers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Stockholder Indemnitees") from and after the Closing, in respect of any Loss which any Stockholder Indemnitees suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of or by virtue of, without duplication:

 

 (a) the breach by Parent of any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement or any certificates delivered in connection herewith; 

 

 (b) the breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement or any certificates delivered in connection herewith; and

 

 (c) Any indemnification made pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall be made in cash or Parent Common Stock (valued based on the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock for the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the date the indemnity is paid), at Parent\'s discretion, provided that in the event cash is to be used, Parent shall first obtain an opinion of a tax advisor (either an accounting firm or a law firm) reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Agent that the use of such cash (together with any other cash payments made with respect to the Merger) should not cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. If Parent elects to issue shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ , it shall be a condition precedent to such issuance that: (i) as of the date of issuance, the immediate resale of such shares by the recipients thereof is registered pursuant to a registration statement which is then effective under the Securities Act, (ii) such shares have been authorized for quotation or listed on Nasdaq or any other applicable securities exchange on which the Parent Common Stock is then quoted or listed, (iii) the Parent shall have confirmed in writing that such shares shall also be entitled to be treated as "Registrable Securities" under the Registration Rights Agreement, (iv) such shares shall not be subject to restrictions pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement, and none of such shares shall be required to be deposited into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and (v) no stop order, suspension of trading or suspension of listing (or threat of delisting) with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be in effect or shall have threatened by the SEC or any self-regulatory organization.

 

 5.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

 (a) No party shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses attributable to the Parent Indemnitees or the Stockholder Indemnitees, as the case may be, exceeds $500,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), _provided_ , _however_ , that thereafter the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for the full amount of such Losses without taking into account the Deductible Amount. Except as set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ , the maximum aggregate obligation of the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 5.2_ shall not exceed the 

  _Section 5.4(d)_ , the maximum aggregate obligation of the Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.3_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the value, as of the
Effective Time, of the Escrow Stock then in escrow, based on the Average Stock
Price.

 

 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ , the foregoing indemnification provisions shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and procedure for all claims for breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or agreement contained herein or in any of the Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto (including, without limitation, claims based in tort, breach or contract or otherwise), other than a suit for specific performance or fraud, and other than claims arising under the Ancillary Agreements. 

 

 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ , the availability of the Escrow Stock for the payment of claims pursuant to _Section 5.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery of the Parent Indemnitees and shall limit any other remedies available to the Parent Indemnitees hereunder or under Applicable Law (other than any claim for specific performance) for the payment of or in respect of such claims or any other claims arising hereunder. For purposes of the payment in respect of any Loss incurred by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.2_ , the value of each share of Escrow Stock shall be determined based upon the average of the closing price of Parent Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending one Business Day prior to the date of such Loss.

 

 (d) Neither the Deductible Amount nor any other limitation in this Agreement shall apply to matters involving fraud, for which there shall be no maximum or limitation with respect to the Stockholder which has committed fraud.

 

 5.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

 (a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 5.2_ and  _5.3_ (an "Indemnified Party") must give the party from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") written notice of such claim (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") within 15 days after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against or involving the Indemnified Party by a Government Entity or other third-party or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts that provide a reasonable basis for concluding such claim could result in indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article V_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time).

 

 (b) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this _Article V_ with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third-party that are subject to the indemnification provided in _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_ above shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

  (i) At its option an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party;

 

 (ii) Notwithstanding _Section 5.5(b)(i)_ above, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party\'s own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (following written notice from the Indemnified Party), in which case the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party\'s counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party; and

 

 (iii) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third-party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), and the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third-party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) unless such judgment or settlement contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party.

 

 (c) _Indemnification Payments_. The parties hereto agree to treat all indemnification payments as adjustments to the Merger Consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , if an Indemnified Party is liable for any additional Taxes as a result of the payment of amounts in respect of a Loss (other than gain to Stockholders as a result of receiving additional consideration), the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party in addition to such amounts in respect of the Loss within ten (10) days after being notified by the Indemnified Party of the payment of such liability (x) an amount equal to such additional Taxes (the "Tax Reimbursement Amount") plus (y) any additional amounts required to pay additional Taxes imposed with respect to the Tax Reimbursement Amount and with respect to amounts payable under this clause (y), with the result that the Indemnified Party shall have received from the Indemnifying Party, net of the payment of Taxes, an amount equal to the Loss.

 

 (d) _Net Tax Benefit Adjustment to Losses_. In the event an Indemnified Party derives a Tax benefit as a result of a Loss, the Indemnified Party shall pay over the amount of tax benefit actually derived, measured as a reduction in the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party compared against what the Tax liability would have been absent the Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Tax benefit shall be payable under this section unless actually realized in a taxable year beginning prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any such Tax benefit shall be offset by fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the basis of the stock in any Subsidiary of Parent is reduced by reason of such Tax benefit. This _Section 5.5(d)_ shall be administered in good faith, and in no event shall any party be entitled to review the Tax Returns of an Indemnified Party in connection with this _Section 5.5(d)_.

  **ARTICLE VII** 
  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Company;

 

 (b) by either Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been consummated by December 31, 2005 (the "Termination Date") for any reason; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;

 

 (c) by either Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and non-appealable;

 

 (d) by Company, (i) upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and which shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 10 business days following notice of such breach and (B) the Termination Date; _provided_ that Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (ii) if Parent notifies Company in writing that Parent intends to consummate a Parent Acquisition Proposal and Company notifies Parent in writing within five Business Days of such notice that Company elects to terminate this Agreement, or (iii) upon the occurrence of a Parent Subsequent Determination;
