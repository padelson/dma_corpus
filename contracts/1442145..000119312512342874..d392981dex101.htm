2.5 _Adjusted Closing Amount_.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 2.5_, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this _Section 2.5(a)_:

 

(i) "Adjusted Closing Amount" shall equal (a) the sum of the Positive Working
Capital Amount, if any, _plus_ the Positive Cash Amount, if any; _less_ (b)
the sum of the Negative Working Capital Amount, if any, plus the Negative Cash
Amount, if any. For purposes of determining the Adjusted Closing Amount, if
one or more of Positive Working Capital Amount, Positive Cash Amount,
Negative Working Capital Amount or Negative Cash Amount has no defined value
due to the then existing facts, then each such amount that has no defined
value shall be factored as a zero (0) in the calculation of Adjusted Closing
Amount.

(ii) "Cash" means (other than restricted) cash and certificates of deposit of
the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
Cash shall specifically exclude the aggregate amount of all checks, deposits
in transit and electronic withdrawals of funds which have not cleared.

(iii) "Current Assets" means (without duplication) the following items as
would be described and set forth on the Financial Statements: (A) Total
Accounts Receivable; (B) Completed Work to be Invoiced; (C) Sales Discounts;
(D) Non-Trade Receivables; and (E) Total Pre-Payments by the Company.

(iv) "Current Liabilities" means (without duplication) the following items as
would be described and set forth on the Financial Statements: (A) Total
Accounts Payable; (B) VAT Payable; (C) Accrued Expenses (including Taxes
Payable and Vacation); (D) Healthcare Reimbursement Accrual; (E) Total Pre-
Payments Paid (Deferred Income) and (F) any other current liabilities
incurred or accrued by any of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Time
that should be reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the
Acquired Companies in accordance with GAAP.

 



23 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Acquired Company is obligated to pay,
following the Closing Date, any portion of Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies or the Sellers Transaction Expenses that are neither paid at or
prior to Closing nor subtracted from the Gross Purchase Price at the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_, then such portion will be deemed to be a
"Current Liability" for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted Closing Amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)._

(b) (i) If Net Working Capital is _greater than_ Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Buyer shall owe to the Sellers (payable as to each Seller,
in an amount equal to his, her or its Pro Rata Share as reflected on the
Seller Spreadsheet and subject to reduction as set forth in _Section 2.5(h)_)
an aggregate amount equal to the amount by which Net Working Capital exceeds
Estimated Net Working Capital (the "Positive Working Capital Amount"), or
(ii) if Net Working Capital is _less than_ Estimated Net Working Capital, then
the Buyer shall be owed from the Sellers the amount by which Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds Net Working Capital (the "Negative Working Capital
Amount"), the payment of which, in each case, shall be effected through the
Adjusted Closing Amount determination and paid as set forth in _Section
2.5(g)_ hereof.

 

(c) (i) If the Cash is _greater than_ the Estimated Closing Cash, then Buyer
shall owe to the Sellers (payable as to each Seller, in an amount equal to
his, her or its Pro Rata Share as reflected on the Seller Spreadsheet and
subject to reduction as set forth in _Section 2.5(h)_) an aggregate amount
equal to the amount by which the Cash exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash (the
"Positive Cash Amount"), or (ii) if the Cash is _less than_ the Estimated
Closing Cash, then the Buyer shall be owed from the Sellers the amount by
which the Estimated Closing Cash exceeds the Cash (the "Negative Cash
Amount"), the payment of which, in each case, shall be effected through the
Adjusted Closing Amount determination and paid as set forth in _Section
2.5(g)_ hereof.

 

(d) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare, or
cause to be prepared (on the same basis as the preparation of the Financial
Statements), and deliver to Oak and the Representative an unaudited statement
(the "Post-Closing Statement"), which shall set forth the Buyers calculation
of the Adjusted Closing Amount, Net Working Capital and Cash. For purposes of
such calculation any amounts outstanding from any Acquired Company or Oak to
any other Acquired Company or Oak shall not be included in such calculation.
At the Buyers request, the Sellers and the Representative (i) shall
reasonably cooperate and assist, and shall cause their respective
representatives to assist, the Buyer and its representatives in the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and (ii) shall provide the Buyer
and its representatives with any information reasonably requested by them.

(e) Upon receipt from the Buyer, Oak and the Representative shall have thirty
(30) days to review the Post-Closing Statement (the "Review Period"). At the
request of Oak and/or the Representative, the Buyer (i) shall reasonably
cooperate and assist, and shall cause its representatives to assist, Oak, the
Representative and their respective representatives, as the case may be, in
the review of the Post-Closing Statement and (ii) shall provide Oak, the
Representative and their respective representatives with any information
reasonably requested by them. If Oak and/or the Representative disagrees with
the Buyers computation of the Adjusted Closing Amount, the Net Working
Capital or Cash, the Representative shall, on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, deliver a written notice to the Buyer (the "Notice of
Objection"), which shall set forth the specific objections to the Buyers
calculation

 



24  of the Adjusted Closing Amount, the Net Working Capital or Cash. The Notice
of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which Oak and/or the
Representative disagrees, together with a written explanation in reasonable
detail of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and
shall set forth Oaks and/or the Representatives calculation of the Adjusted
Closing Amount, Cash and/or the Net Working Capital based on such objections.
To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection delivered during the
Review Period, Oak, the Representative and the Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with the Buyers calculation of the Adjusted Closing Amount, Cash and
the Net Working Capital and no party may thereafter dispute any item or amount
not set forth in the Notice of Objection.

(f) Unless Oak or the Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Buyer within the Review Period, Oak, the Representative and the Sellers shall
be deemed to have accepted the Buyers calculation of the Adjusted Closing
Amount, Cash and the Adjusted Closing Amount set forth in the Post-Closing
Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding. If Oak and/or the
Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to the Buyer within the
Review Period, the Buyer, Oak and the Representative shall, during the thirty
(30) days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items and amounts in order to finally determine the amount of the Adjusted
Closing Amount. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, the Buyer, Oak and the Representative are unable to resolve their
disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the
Buyer, Oak and the Representative (the "Independent Expert"). The parties
shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review this _Section 2.5_
and to determine solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so
submitted whether and to what extent, if any, the Adjusted Closing Amount set
forth in the Post- Closing Statement requires adjustment. The Independent
Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions by the
Buyer, Oak and the Representative and not on an independent review. The Buyer,
Oak and the Representative shall make available to the Independent Expert all
relevant Books and Records and other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Expert. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after its retention, the Independent Expert shall deliver to
the Buyer, Oak and the Representative a report which sets forth its resolution
of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of the Adjusted Closing
Amount. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert
shall be shared equally by the Buyer and the Sellers, pro rata. The Buyer, Oak
and the Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Independent
Expert, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities in
favor of the Independent Expert.

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the Adjusted Closing Amount has been
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_:

(i) if the Adjusted Closing Amount is a positive number or zero, the Buyer
shall, subject to reduction pursuant to _Section 2.5(h),_ pay to each Seller
such Sellers Pro Rata Share (as reflected on the Seller Spreadsheet) of the
Closing Cash Holdback _plus_ the Adjusted Closing Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions set forth for
such Seller on the Seller Spreadsheet;

 



25 (ii) if the Adjusted Closing Amount is a negative number, but the
absolute value of the Adjusted Closing Amount is less than the amount of the
Closing Cash Holdback, the Buyer shall, subject to reduction pursuant to
_Section 2.5(h)_, pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share (as
reflected on the Seller Spreadsheet) of the amount by which the Closing Cash
Holdback exceeds the absolute value of the Adjusted Closing Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions
set forth for such Seller on the Seller Spreadsheet; or

(iii) if the Adjusted Closing Amount is a negative number, and the absolute
value of the Adjusted Closing Amount is greater than the amount of the
Closing Cash Holdback (such amount, the "Cash Deficiency"), each Seller shall
pay to the Buyer such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Cash Deficiency by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions
of the Buyer delivered to Oak and the Representative; the Buyer shall have the
right and option to claim any amounts of the Cash Deficiency not received
within such five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the
Adjusted Closing Amount against the Oak Indemnity Escrow and/or the Non-Oak
Sellers Indemnity Escrow, as applicable.

 

(h) In the event of a payment by the Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to either
_Section 2.5(g)(i)_ or _2.5(g)(ii)_ , the amounts otherwise payable to the
Sellers shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of the Sellers Transaction
Expenses owed to Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch pursuant to Parents
arrangements with each of them as a consequence of the adjustments to the
purchase price under such sections. The Buyer shall promptly pay the amount of
such Sellers Transaction Fees to Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.

2.6 _Withholding_. Each of the Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable by it
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it determines may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
and to request and be provided any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form
W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar
information from the Sellers and, to the extent required by applicable Tax
Laws, any beneficial owner of any interest in any of the Sellers. In the event
that any amount is so deducted and withheld, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom the payment from which such amounts were withheld was made.

 

2.7 _Approval/Waivers_. Each Seller and Oak Blocker hereby: (i) approves this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions; (ii)
waives compliance with any provisions of the Parent LLC Agreement and the
Investor Rights Agreement, including with respect to the transfer of Units
and/or the Oak Shares, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions; (iii)
amends and restates the Parent LLC Agreement effective as of the Closing to
list the Buyer as the owner of all outstanding Class A Common Units and Class
B Common Units; and (iv) terminates the Investor Rights Agreement effective
as of the Closing.

 



26 2.8 _Allocation of Consideration; Section 743 Adjustment_. The total
consideration paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the Oak
Indemnity Escrow Agreement and Non-Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall be
allocated for Tax purposes among the Oak Shares, the Class A Common Units and
the Class B Common Units in accordance with _Schedule 2.8_, to this
Agreement (the amount allocable to the Class A Common Units and the Class B
Common Units, the "Units Consideration"), and the allocation set forth on
_Schedule 2.8_ shall be binding on the parties hereto for all Tax reporting
purposes. Parent shall file an election under Section 754 of the Code (and any
equivalent election for applicable state and local income Tax purposes), which
Section 754 election (and equivalent election) shall be filed by Parent with
its U.S. federal income Tax Return (and applicable state and local income Tax
Returns) for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and shall be
effective for such year, and any other forms necessary for the completion of
a valid Section 754 election (and equivalent election) effective as of such
taxable year and any subsequent taxable year. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and provide
Representative with one or more schedules allocating the Units Consideration
among the assets of Parent and the Company, and setting forth the Section 743
basis adjustment consistent with the Section 754 election. The Representative
shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of the delivery of the foregoing
schedule or schedules to review and provide comments to the Buyer and the
Buyer will reasonably consider any and all reasonable comments provided
by Representative with respect to such schedule or schedules, provided that
the Buyer shall not have any obligation to accept or incorporate any of the
Representatives comments. Any cost associated with the Section 754 election,
including, without limitation, reasonable accounting fees, shall be paid by
the Buyer.

adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of
operations of the Acquired Companies and the changes in their cash flows, on
a consolidated basis, for such periods have been included in the Financial

them after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing
such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, (c) that

Representative or the Company or (y) the interpretation, making, performance,
breach or termination hereof or of the Purchase Agreement or (d) that such

Sellers. If any Seller or the Representative or any of their Affiliates are
compelled to disclose any such information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law, such Person shall promptly notify the

be disclosed, provided that such Person shall exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.
Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available in this
Agreement, the parties each acknowledge that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this _Section 7.5_, and that the Buyer
will be entitled to specific performance and other equitable relief by way of
injunction in respect of a breach or threatened breach of any this _Section

other parties reasonable time to comment thereon prior to issuance or
release). The Buyer may issue any press release or make any public statement
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the consent of the
Representative, Oak or any other party hereto provided that the Buyer shall
consult with the Representative

70 7.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and Oak Blocker which are
filed after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, the filing or
amendment of any Tax Returns that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. For
purposes of preparing any income Tax Returns of Parent for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.8_, the Buyer
shall allocate income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (or items thereof)
attributable to such Pre-Closing Tax Period to the Sellers in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Parent LLC Agreement, consistent with
past practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or Order. With
respect to the preparation and filing of any income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that results in the
allocation and pass-through of any of the Acquired Companies items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit to the Non-Oak Sellers or Oak Blockers
income Tax Returns, the Buyer shall provide a draft copy of such income Tax
Returns to the Representative at least twenty-three (23) days prior to the
Buyers chosen filing date for such income Tax Returns and shall make
revisions to such income Tax Returns in response to comments provided by
Representative to Buyer no less than seven (7) days prior to the Buyers
chosen filing date, provided that such proposed revisions shall only be made
if they are reasonable, in accordance with the Acquired Companies past Tax
practices, in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, not contrary to any
applicable Tax Proceeding or other Order and such revisions will not increase
the Tax Liabilities of any of the Acquired Companies, Oak Blocker or the Buyer
(as compared to if such revisions were not made) for any Taxable period that
includes any period following Closing. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Non-Oak Sellers and Oak Blocker shall include income, gain, loss,
deduction or other tax items attributable to the operations of the Acquired
Companies that arises from any Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Pre-Closing Income")
on their respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with their allocable
share of Pre-Closing Income set forth on their respective Schedule K-1s or
other Tax reporting documents attributable to their pre-Closing ownership of
Parent (and indirect ownership of any of the Acquired Companies) (with respect
to each Non-Oak Seller and Oak Blocker, its "Allocable Share") and as shall
be furnished to the Non-Oak Sellers and Oak Blocker by the Buyer or Parent for
such periods; provided, that with respect to Oak Blockers Allocable Share of
Pre-Closing Income, Oak shall be obligated to remit the amount of Taxes
incurred by Oak Blocker as a result of Oak Blockers Allocable Share of Pre-
Closing Income to the Buyer within seven (7) days of receiving: (A) written
notice from the Buyer of the amount to be remitted, and (B) the relevant
Schedule K-1s or other Tax reporting document that reflects Oak Blockers
Allocable Share of Pre-Closing Income. Upon the Buyer receiving the amount of
Taxes arising from Oak Blockers Allocable Share of Pre-Closing Income, the
Buyer shall timely remit the amount received from Oak to the appropriate
Taxing Authorities to satisfy such Tax Liability of Oak Blocker. Any Taxes to
be reported and to be paid by the Sellers as a result of such Sellers (or
Oak Blockers) Allocable Share of Pre-Closing Income shall be excluded from,
not subject to, and not limited by, the Basket or any Individual Aggregate Cap
or the Aggregate Cap.

 



71 (ii) With respect to any and all Tax Returns of Oak Blocker or any
Acquired Company that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for which the
Buyer seeks payment pursuant to _Section 7.8(a)(i)_ or for which the Buyer
may seek indemnification for Taxes pursuant to _Article X_ , the Buyer
shall: (A) provide a draft copy of such Tax Returns to the Representative at
least twenty-three (23) days prior to the Buyers chosen filing date for such
Tax Returns; and (B) reasonably consider any and all reasonable comments
provided by Representative with respect to such Tax Returns, provided that
such comments are provided to Buyer no less than fifteen (15) days prior to
the Buyers chosen filing date, provided, further, that the Buyer shall fully
control the preparation, filing and/or amending of all such Tax Returns and,
notwithstanding the Buyers consideration of the Representatives comments,
neither the Buyer nor any Acquired Company nor Oak Blocker shall have any
obligation to accept or incorporate into any such Tax Returns any of the
Representatives comments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.8(a)(ii)_, with respect to filing any Tax Return for any Acquired
Company or Oak Blocker that pertains to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in any Tax
jurisdiction where a Tax Return has not previously been filed by such Acquired
Company or Oak Blocker, in order for any Buyer Indemnitee to be eligible for
indemnification under _Article X_ with respect to any Tax Liability that may
arise from, or be identified by, any such Tax Return, either (I) the filing of
such Tax Return must be in response to the Buyers reasonably chosen
resolution of a written or verbal notice from, audit, administrative or court
proceeding involving, any Taxing Authority or as otherwise approved by the
Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), or (II) a "commercially reasonable basis" must exist for the
filing of such Tax Return. For purposes of this _Section 7.8(a)(ii)_, a
"commercially reasonable basis" shall include, without limitation, the Buyers
decision to cause Oak Blocker or any Acquired Company to engage in a
voluntary worker classification settlement program, voluntary compliance
procedure, tax amnesty program or other settlement program with any Taxing
Authority.

 

(iii) Except in connection with the settlement or other disposition of any Tax
Proceeding to which one or more of the Acquired Companies and/or Oak Blocker
is a party and that relates to the Tax treatment of the Class B Common Units
issued to any Class B Common Unit Holder (subject to the proviso at the
conclusion of this _Section 7.8(a)(iii)_) or as required by any applicable
Law enacted from and after the date hereof or any applicable ruling, binding
authority or precedent issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or the
IRS (or other applicable taxing authority) from and after the date hereof,
the Buyer agrees that the Class B Common Unit Holders shall be treated as
partners for all Tax purposes, consistent with the past practices of the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding anything set forth in _Section 7.8(b)(i)_
to the contrary, each Class B Common Unit Holder shall determine and control,
in such Class B Common Unit Holders sole discretion, any Tax Proceeding (or
portion thereof) regarding the Tax treatment of the Class B Common Units on
such Class B Common Unit Holders personal Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (x) with respect to any such Tax Proceeding, the Class B
Common Unit Holders shall act only on their own behalf, with respect to their
own personal Tax Returns and shall not represent Oak Blocker or any Acquired
Company; (y)

 



72  the Class B Common Unit Holder shall keep the Buyer informed in writing as
to any such Tax Proceeding; and (z) the Class B Common Unit Holder shall
consider in good faith any written comments submitted by the Buyer with
respect to any such Tax Proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
shall determine and control, in the Buyers sole discretion, the preparation,
prosecution, defense, settlement, disposition and/or conduct of any Tax
Proceeding (and the preparation of any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
or Oak Blocker, including, amended Tax Returns, filed as a result of the
settlement or other disposition of such Tax Proceeding) to which one or more
of the Acquired Companies or Oak Blocker is a party and that relates to the
Tax treatment by the Acquired Companies or Oak Blocker of the Class B Common
Units issued to any Class B Common Unit Holder during any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Buyer shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede such a Tax Proceeding (or the relevant portion thereof) without
the written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(b) _Tax Proceedings; Cooperation_.

 

(i) The Buyer shall determine and control (in its sole discretion) the
preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, disposition and/or conduct of
any audit, examination, claim for refund, administrative or judicial
proceeding or other Action involving any Tax Liability or refund (a "Tax
Proceeding") with respect to any Acquired Company or Oak Blocker for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any Tax
Proceeding (or portion thereof) of an Acquired Company that could reasonably
result in an adverse adjustment (when compared to the prior income
Tax filings of the Acquired Companies) to any Non-Oak Sellers Allocable
Share of Pre-Closing Income as previously reported on their personal Tax
Returns, the Buyer shall not settle, compromise and/or concede the relevant
portion of such Tax Proceeding that relates to such adverse adjustment
without the written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably, withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Buyer shall keep the
Representative informed in writing as to any such Tax Proceeding as it
affects a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Buyer shall consider in good faith
any written comments submitted to Buyer with respect to any such Tax
Proceeding.

 

(ii) The Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall each cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party such cooperation and information, as and to the
extent reasonably requested, in connection with preparing, reviewing, signing
and filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining Liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or
in conducting any audit or other Action with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings
and other determinations by Governmental Entities relating to Taxes, and
relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any
such party may possess. Each party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules,
work papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax
matters of the Acquired Companies and Oak Blocker for the Tax period first
ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later
of either (A) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notice is provided with respect thereto, any extensions thereof)
for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate or (B)
any record retention agreement entered into with any Tax Authority. Each of
the Buyer and the Representative shall give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding any such books and
records and, in the case of any proposed transfer, destruction or discarding
of such by the Representative, if the Buyer so requests, the Representative
shall allow the Buyer to take possession of such books and records, and in the
case of any proposed transfer, destruction or discarding of such by the
Buyer, if the Representative so requests, the Buyer shall retain such records
for an additional period of time reasonably requested by the Representative.
Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

 



73 (c) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.

 

(i) If an Acquired Company or Oak Blocker is permitted but not required under
applicable state, local, or foreign income Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period, then the parties shall treat that day as
the last day of a taxable period.

(ii) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, capital or revenues of the Acquired Companies
or Oak Blocker for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, (A) deductions in employment and payroll related
Taxes, including, the withholding of all income Taxes, FICA and FUTA, and (B)
the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Acquired Companies or Oak Blocker holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of any other Taxes of the
Acquired Companies or Oak Blocker for a Straddle Period which relate to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

(iii) Except as otherwise required by Law, all deductions for the Sellers
Transaction Expenses shall be reflected on the Tax Returns for the Pre-
Closing Tax Periods.

(d) _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees_. Any Transfer Taxes arising out of
or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement
shall be paid by the party upon whom the applicable Law imposes such Transfer
Tax. Such party shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes and the other party shall provide such
cooperation in connection with the preparation and filing of such
documentation and Tax Returns as may be reasonably requested by the filing
party.

 



74 (e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Sellers shall ensure that any
and all Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements or arrangements binding any Acquired Company and/or Oak Blocker
shall be terminated with respect to the Acquired Company and Oak Blocker as of
the day before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, none of
any Acquired Company or Oak Blocker shall have an obligation to make any
payments or have any Liability in respect thereof to any Person for any
period.

 

(f) _Carryovers, Refunds, and Related Matters_. Any refund of Taxes (including
any interest thereon) that relates to an Acquired Company or Oak Blocker
shall be the property of such Acquired Company or Oak Blocker, as applicable,
and shall be retained by such Acquired Company (or promptly paid by the
Sellers to such Acquired Company if any such refund (or interest thereon)
is received by a Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller) or Oak Blocker (or
promptly paid by Oak to Oak Blocker if any such refund (or interest thereon)
is received by Oak or any Affiliate of Oak). Any refund of income Taxes that
arises from an allocation and pass-through of Pre-Closing Income of the
Acquired Companies to any Seller and which was properly reported on such
Sellers income Tax Return shall be the property of such Seller, provided,
that in the case of any such income Tax refund received by Oak Blocker, Oak
Blocker shall promptly remit the amount of such income Tax refund to Oak. Any
and all Tax refunds, assets or benefits of Oak Blocker arising from or
attributable to, directly or indirectly, any expenses of any Acquired Company
incurred or deemed to have been incurred prior to or through the Closing other
than Sellers Transaction Expenses shall be the property of Oak Blocker and
shall not be paid to Oak.

 

7.9 _Access to Books and Records_. The Buyer will, and will cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating
to the respective businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries and Oak Blocker
for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date (or longer if required
by applicable requirements of Law) and will make such records and personnel
available to the Sellers and the Representative as may be reasonably required
by such party in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by,
Action or tax audits against or governmental investigations of, the Sellers
and the Representative or any of their respective Affiliates.

7.10 _Further Assurances_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the parties
hereto shall (and (i) the Sellers and Parent shall cause the Acquired
Companies to and (ii) Oak shall cause Oak Blocker to) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions. If
at any time (whether before or after the Closing) any further action is
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, that action.

7.11 _Directors  and Officers Insurance Policy_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company may obtain a six (6) year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and the Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement
with respect to claims arising in whole or in part from factors or events
that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the Closing Date.

 



75 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will fulfill and honor the obligations to indemnify, advance
expenses and exculpate the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods prior to and including the
Closing as are currently set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Company and the Subsidiaries subject to any limitation imposed from time to
time under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall have
the right to liquidate, dissolve, wind-up, merge, consolidate or otherwise
effect the corporate or entity existence of any of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries.

7.12  _Representative_.

(a) Each of the Sellers irrevocably appoints Leonard Laufer (the
"Representative") with power of designation and assignment as his, her or its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution, to
act solely and exclusively on behalf of, and in the name of, such Seller with
the full power, without the consent of such Seller, to exercise as the
Representative deems appropriate, the powers which such Seller could exercise
under the provisions of this Agreement, the Non-Oak Sellers Indemnity Escrow
Agreement or the Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative in connection
with this Agreement, the Non-Oak Sellers Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the
Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement, which shall include the power and
authority to amend, modify, waive or provide consent with respect to, any
provision of this Agreement, the Non-Oak Sellers Indemnity Escrow Agreement or
the Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement and to execute, deliver and accept such
waivers and consents and any and all notices, documents, certificates or
other papers to be delivered in connection with this Agreement, the Non-Oak
Sellers Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions as the Representative may
deem necessary or desirable. A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the
Representative shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all
of the Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive on each Seller. All
decisions, acts, consents or instructions of the Representative may be relied
upon by any third party as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
every Seller. In any Third Party Defense in which more than one Seller is
an Indemnitor, the Representative shall act on behalf of all Seller
Indemnitors. The Buyer and the Buyer Indemnitees, if applicable, will be
entitled to rely exclusively upon any notices and other acts of the
Representative as being legally binding acts of each Seller individually and
the Sellers collectively. The appointment and power of attorney granted by
each Seller to the Representative shall be deemed coupled with an interest and
all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable whether by death or
incapacity of any such Seller or the occurrence of any other event or events.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Representative will not be
liable to the Sellers for any act done or omitted hereunder as the
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will
be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Sellers will, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Representative and hold it harmless against any
Losses incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of
the Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties under this Agreement and the Non-Oak Sellers
Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 



76 (c) Each of the Sellers will reimburse the Representative for his, her or its
Pro Rata Share of any out-of-pocket, independent, third-party fees and
expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and other
advisors) incurred by the Representative that arise out of or are in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Representatives
duties under this Agreement and the Non-Oak Sellers Indemnity Escrow Agreement
and the Oak Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

7.13 _Restrictive Covenants_.

(a) For the period (the "Restricted Period") commencing on the Closing Date
and ending (i) with respect to each of Leonard Laufer, Michael Heller, Nana
Banerjee, Nicholas Daffan, Edward Niestat and Nicholas Sulkowski, on the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to each of
Michael Blumstein and Steven Underwood, on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, each such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, and each
such Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, anywhere in the world,
directly or indirectly, (i) own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed
by, or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be connected
in any manner with, (ii) perform any research or development or marketing
services for, or (iii) provide advice, services, Intellectual Property
(including Know How) or financing or economic assistance to, any Person which
is engaged in, or proposing to engage in, either directly or indirectly, the
business engaged in by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Business"). It is recognized that the Restricted Business is
expected to be conducted throughout the world and that more narrow
geographical limitations of any nature on this non-competition covenant (and
covenant set forth in _Section 7.13(b))_ are therefore not appropriate.

(b) The Sellers agree that during their respective Restricted Periods, they
shall not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to), (i) solicit
the employment or engagement of services of any Person who is or was an
employee, contractor or consultant of any Acquired Company, the Buyer or its
Affiliates, hire any such Person, or persuade, induce or attempt to persuade
or induce any such Person to leave his, her or its employment or to refrain
from providing services to any Acquired Company, the Buyer or its Affiliates
or (ii) solicit or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, or
cause or authorize any other Person to solicit or induce any Person to
cease, diminish or not commence doing business with any Acquired Company, the
Buyer or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall preclude the hiring of any employee or independent contractor of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (i) who responds to a general
solicitation of employment through an advertisement not targeted specifically
at the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or their respective employees
(such general solicitation shall not constitute a violation of this _Section
7.13(b)_), (ii) who contacts a Seller or its Affiliate on his or her own
initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by such Seller or its
Affiliate, or (iii) through the services of an employment search firm.

(c) The Sellers acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this  _Section
7.13_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Buyer and constitute a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Sellers acknowledge that any violation of this _Section 7.13_ will
result in irreparable injury to the Buyer and agree that the Buyer shall be
entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the necessity
of proving actual damages, as well as an equitable accounting of all
earnings, profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this
_Section 7.13_, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other
rights or remedies to which the Buyer may be entitled.

 



77 (d) In the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 7.13_ should
ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any
court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall
be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this _Section 7.13_ and each provision thereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

until such claim is finally resolved. The right to indemnification based on
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements.

10.6 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under the provisions of this _Article X_ (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such
Third Party Claim (such notice, a "Notice of Claim"); _provided_ that the
failure or delay in notifying the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim will
not relieve the Indemnitor of any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that such
failure or delay caused actual prejudice to the Indemnitor with respect to
such Third Party Claim.

 



88 (b) As to any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will have fifteen (15)
days from the date on which the Indemnitor receives the Notice of Claim (the
"Indemnitor Defense Review Period") to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom (a "Third Party Defense");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that such Third Party Claim is
asserted or commenced against any Buyer Indemnitee and relates to Tax the
Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled in all respects to control the defense. If
the Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel (but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnitor unless the employment
of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnitor)
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor
shall control the defense thereof; (ii) the Indemnitor will not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (iii) the Indemnitor shall be
conclusively deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within
the scope of its indemnity obligation under this Agreement; (iv) the
Indemnitor shall conduct the Third Party Defense actively and diligently and
provide reasonable updates in connection with the Third Party Defense to the
Indemnitee; and (v) the Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the
Third Party Defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if counsel for
the Indemnitee reasonably determines that there is a conflict between the
positions of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in conducting the defense of
such Action or that there are legal defenses available to such Indemnitee
different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnitor, then
counsel for the Indemnitee shall be entitled, if the Indemnitee so elects, to
conduct the defense to the extent reasonably determined by such counsel to
protect the interests of the Indemnitee, at the expense of the Indemnitor.

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense prior to the end
of the Indemnitor Defense Review Period, the Indemnitee shall have the right
to assume the Third Party Defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in such Third
Party Defense but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof. The Indemnitee shall conduct the Third Party Defense
actively and diligently, and the Indemnitor will provide reasonable
cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim in any manner without the consent of the Indemnitor which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(d) The Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if:

 

(i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief; 

(ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Action, indictment or allegation;

 



89 (iii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnitee of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third Party Defense or
the maximum foreseeable damages or amount that may be claimed exceeds the
applicable escrow amount;

 

(iv) the Third Party Claim could give rise to Losses which are more than the
amount indemnifiable by the Indemnitor pursuant to this _Article X_ ; or

(v) in the case where the Indemnitee is Buyer Indemnitee, the Third Party
Claim relates to Taxes.

10.7 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event of
a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against it,
the Indemnitee shall send a notice of claim to the Indemnitor. The notice of
claim shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate, of
the foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) and a description of the basis
for such claim. The Indemnitor will have fifteen (15) days from receipt of
such notice of claim to dispute the claim and the Indemnitee will provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance the Indemnitor in determining the
validity of the claim for indemnity. If the Indemnitor does not give notice to
the Indemnitee that it disputes such claim within fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of the notice of claim, the claim specified in such notice of claim
will be conclusively deemed a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder.

10.8 _Limitations of Liability; Determinations of Loss Amount; Exclusive
Remedies_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for any Losses to the extent such Indemnitee has been indemnified
or reimbursed for such amount under any other provisions of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, including any adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.5_, or for any Losses to the extent such Indemnitee
would have been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other
provisions of this Agreement but for certain limitations on receiving such
amount, including the limitations set forth in _Section 10.2_.

 

(b) The Losses suffered by any Indemnitee shall be calculated after giving
effect to any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee from third
parties, including insurance proceeds. If any insurance proceeds or other
recoveries from third parties are actually recovered by an Indemnitee
subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnitee of an indemnification payment
hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds or third
party recoveries relate, the Indemnitee shall hold such recovered amounts in
trust and promptly refund to each Indemnitor its pro rata share of such
amount.

 

(c) Any Indemnitee that becomes aware of any Losses for which it seeks
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses (regardless of whether mitigation
is required under applicable Law), including seeking all available insurance
and other third party recoveries and an Indemnitor shall not be liable for
any Losses to the extent that it is attributable to the Indemnitees failure
to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 10.8(c)_

 



90 (d) Except with respect to claims based on fraud by an Indemnitor or a request
for injunctive relief or specific performance or in connection with a dispute
under _Section 2.5_, the parties hereby agree that following the Closing, no
party shall have any liability, and no party shall make any claim for any
Losses or other matter under, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement whether based on contract, tort, strict liability,
other Laws or otherwise, except as provided in this _Article X_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall
be liable under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special, punitive or exemplary damages,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise and
whether or not arising from the other Partys sole, joint or
concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault.

10.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any
indemnification payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the consideration
payable under this Agreement.

11.3 _Expenses_. Each party hereto shall bear its own costs, fees and expenses
with respect to this transaction and the preparation and execution of this

provided, that no assignment of any partys rights or obligations may be made
without the written consent of the other parties hereto and any such
assignment shall provide that the assigning party will continue to be bound
by all obligations hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and
perform such obligations to the extent that its assignee fails to do so.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) this Agreement or any of the rights or
obligations of the Buyer hereunder may be assigned by the Buyer at any time
to any Affiliate of the Buyer provided that the Buyer remains primarily
responsible to pay the consideration payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, (ii) this Agreement may be assigned by any party (other than the
Buyer) (the "Assigning Party") after Closing without the consent of the other
parties (the "Non-assigning Party") to an Affiliate of the Assigning Party, in
each case provided that advance notice of such assignment is given to the
Non-assigning Party, such Affiliate enters into a written agreement with the
Non-assigning Party to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement in all
respects and to the same extent as the Assigning Party is bound and that the
Assigning Party will continue to be bound by all obligations hereunder as if
such assignment had not occurred and perform such obligations to the extent
that such Affiliate fails to do so and (ii) the Buyer may collaterally assign
its rights under this Agreement in connection with any secured loan
arrangement.

11.5 _Governing Law_. The Laws of the State of New York applicable to

exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in New York for
the purposes of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, and agrees to
commence any such Action only in such courts. Each party further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such partys respective address set forth herein shall be effective service of
process for any such Action. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this
Agreement, Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Action brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF AND THEREOF.

11.7 _Counterparts_. The parties may sign this Agreement in several
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one instrument. The parties agree that delivery of
this Agreement may be effected by means of an exchange of facsimile or other
electronic copies which shall have the same effect as signatures delivered in
person.

11.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.11_,
this Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person, including any employee, any beneficiary or dependents
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, other than the
parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
_Article X_ , the other Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, are
intended third party beneficiaries of the provisions contained in such
Article.

Exhibits, the Schedules and the other documents, instruments and other
agreements specifically referred to in this Agreement and/or such documents or
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or such documents constitute the final
and entire agreement between the parties and the complete and exclusive
expression of the parties agreement on the subject matter of this Agreement
superseding all prior oral or written agreements or policies relating to this
Agreement other than confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-compete
agreements between any of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies, which
agreements shall remain in full force and effect as of and following Closing.
The provisions of this Agreement may not be explained, supplemented, or
qualified through evidence of trade usage or a prior course of dealings or
performance.

11.10  _Captions_. All captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



94 11.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. Each of the Non-Oak Sellers Disclosure Schedule,
the Oak Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the
"Disclosure Schedules") has been arranged in sections corresponding to each
representation and warranty set forth in _Article III_ , _Article IV_ and 
_Article V_ , respectively. The disclosure in any section of the Non-Oak
Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the corresponding section in this
Agreement and such other sections of this Agreement as may be reasonably
apparent on its face from such disclosure that it is applicable to another
section of the Disclosure Schedules or to the extent disclosure in any section
of the Non-Oak Sellers Disclosure Schedule is specifically cross-referenced in
another section of the Disclosure Schedules. The disclosure in any section of
the Oak Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the corresponding section in this
Agreement and such other sections of this Agreement as may be reasonably
apparent on its face from such disclosure that it is applicable to another
section of the Disclosure Schedules or to the extent disclosure in any section
of the Oak Disclosure Schedule is specifically cross-referenced in another
section of the Disclosure Schedules. The disclosure in any section of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the corresponding section in
this Agreement and such other sections of this Agreement as may be reasonably
apparent on its face from such disclosure that it is applicable to another
section of the Disclosure Schedules or to the extent disclosure in any
section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule is specifically cross-referenced in
another section of the Disclosure Schedules. Neither the specification of any
dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement. To the extent that there is any
discrepancy between the description of an item or matter disclosed in any of
the Disclosure Schedules and the corresponding Data Room Reference number on
the Disclosure Schedules, the description of the item or matter shall control.

 

11.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Agreement, or application of that provision to any Persons or circumstances,
or in any jurisdiction, other than those as to which it is held unenforceable,
will not be affected by that unenforceability and will be enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

11.13 _Specific Performance_. The Buyer and the Sellers each agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof
and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof pursuant to and in accordance with the terms hereof acknowledging that
the purchases and sales contemplated hereby are intended to occur
contemporaneously and are each contingent one upon the other, in addition to
any other remedy at Law or equity.

 

11.14 _Interpretation_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof.

 



95 11.15 _Guaranty_. Verisk unconditionally guaranties the prompt and full
discharge by the Buyer of all of the Buyers covenants, agreements and
obligations in this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. If the
Buyer shall default in the due and punctual performance of any of the Buyers
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder, Verisk shall perform or cause
to be performed such covenants, agreements or obligations.
