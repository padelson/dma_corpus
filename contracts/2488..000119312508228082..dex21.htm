to the extent appropriate, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to) take all
steps necessary to ensure that the transfer of the Purchased Software is not

Licensed IP Assets shall be governed by the applicable provision of the
Transition Services Agreement (or related statement of work), to the extent
(and only to the extent) expressly covered thereby and expressly enumerated
therein; (y) Seller shall deliver all the forms of the Technology elements of
the Purchased Assets and of the Licensed IP Assets then in the possession of
Seller, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, by of example, the Source

with _Section 1.7(a)_; and (z) upon identification by either Party of any
prior version of Technology included in the Purchased Assets previously
undelivered, Seller shall deliver such version to Purchaser if such version

contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
(or enter into a sublease with respect to) any Purchased Asset, Contract
underlying a consent required by _Section 6.3(d)_, or other Contract, Permit
(including any Environmental Permit), Approval, certificate, authorization or
other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable (or otherwise is
prohibited) without the consent of a third party or a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an
assignment (or sublease) (" _Nonassignable Assets_ ") unless and until such
consent shall have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Real Property Transfer Agreements for Sellers
Assigned Leasehold and Subleasehold Interests in Frimley, United Kingdom and
Shanghai, China shall be in the form of a real property license or similar
occupancy agreement which shall not require the respective landlords
consent, and Purchasers employees shall have the right to occupy such
Nonassignable Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Real
Property Transfer Agreements applicable thereto. Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause each of its relevant Subsidiaries to, diligently and
expeditiously take such action as is necessary or advisable to obtain such
consents as promptly as reasonably practicable; _provided, however,_ that all
costs and expenses (other than costs and expenses of Sellers legal counsel)

other Contract, Permit (including any Environmental Permit), Approval,
certificate, authorization or other right constituting a consent required by

herein shall require Purchaser, in connection with any such required consent
or arrangement, (i) to pay or assume responsibility for any unreasonable cost
or expense or (ii) agree to additional terms and conditions that are adverse
to Purchaser in any material respect, in each case in connection with the
applicable Contract, Permit, Approval, or other instrument to which such
required consent relates). To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and
the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, in the event any such consents to
assignment cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be held, from
and after the Closing, by Seller and its Subsidiaries in trust for Purchaser
and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser
in the name of Seller and its Subsidiaries and all benefits and obligations
existing thereunder shall be for Purchasers account. Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall take or cause to be taken at Purchasers expense such
actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to
provide Purchaser with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect
collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under
the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall promptly pay
over to Purchaser all money or other consideration received by any of them in
respect of all Nonassignable Assets. From and after the Closing, Seller, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, authorizes Purchaser, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets,
at Purchasers expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all
the benefits of Seller and its Subsidiaries under the Nonassignable Assets.
If after the Closing any Nonassignable Asset becomes assignable (either
because consent for the assignment thereof is obtained or otherwise), Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser and transfer and assign such previously
Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser, as Purchaser
shall designate.

its Subsidiaries to, make available to Purchaser such non-confidential data
in personnel records of Continuing Employees, to the extent (if any) such
records have not theretofore been delivered to Purchaser as part of the
Purchased Assets, as is reasonably necessary for Purchaser to transition such
employees into Purchasers records; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall
have no obligation to make available any records the disclosure of which is
prohibited by Law.

any of its Subsidiaries, Seller shall as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after discovery thereof) forward or

of any "bulk transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to
Purchaser and its designated Subsidiaries.

under any applicable Tax Law of any other jurisdiction where any of the
Purchased Assets are situated, by the date required by applicable Law) and
any required exhibits thereto (the " _Asset Acquisition Statement_ ")

Assets. Seller shall provide such cooperation to Purchaser and BIL as may be

Seller from time to time revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement
(the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as to report any matters in the Asset
Acquisition Statement that require revision as a result of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement. If Seller disputes any

case may be), Seller shall deliver written notice of its objection to

may refer the matter for determination to an Accountant, whose determination
shall be final and binding. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne by the non-prevailing Party in such dispute.

(b) The final allocation of the Purchase Price shall be final and binding
upon the parties for all purposes, including the filing of all Tax Returns or
other returns and the preparation of all financial statements and other
documents and records, and the Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets shall
be allocated in accordance with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if
applicable, the last Revised Statement, provided by Purchaser or BIL (as
applicable) to Seller (or, if applicable, the Accountants determination),
and all Tax Returns and reports filed by Purchaser, BIL and Seller shall be
prepared consistently with such allocation, unless otherwise required pursuant
to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The parties shall make jointly the necessary elections and
execute and file, within the prescribed delays, the prescribed election forms
and any other documents required to give effect to the foregoing and shall
also prepare and file all of their respective Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with such elections.

Purchased Assets located in such jurisdiction be fixed and determined at or
prior to the Effective Time (or within any time period after the Effective
Time that is shorter than the time period set forth in this _Section
1.9(a)_), Purchaser, BIL and Seller shall agree to the allocation of such
portion prior to the Closing and shall execute and deliver at the Closing
such documentation as may be required by (or sufficient under) applicable Law
to memorialize and report such allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser, BIL and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree

Purchased Assets located in each jurisdiction other than the United States and
Canada at the Closing in connection with the form of Bill of Sale or local
asset purchase agreement (if any) applicable to each such jurisdiction.

Purchaser, except as otherwise set forth in the disclosure schedule and
schedule of exceptions delivered by Seller herewith and dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "). The parties hereto agree that

Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) the representations and warranties contained in
the corresponding section and subsection of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
any other representation and warranty contained in this Agreement, unless the

of) such other representation and warranty is readily apparent from the face
of such disclosure to a Person who has read only that reference and such
other representation and warranty and Seller has used commercially reasonable
efforts to provide express cross-references where applicable.

2.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Seller is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, and has full corporate power and authority to conduct the
Business as presently conducted and to own, use, license and lease the Assets
and Properties of the Business. Seller is duly qualified, licensed or admitted
to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification, licensing or admission is necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

Purchased Assets to Liability for violation of Law. Each Subsidiary of Seller
that holds any of the Purchased Assets, each of which set forth in _Section
2.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation, as set forth in _Section 2.1 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, and has full corporate power and authority to conduct the Business
as presently conducted and to own, use, license and lease its Assets and
Properties. Each such Seller Subsidiary is duly qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of the
Purchased Assets held by it, or the conduct of the portion of the Business
conducted by it, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary,
except for such qualifications, licenses or admissions the absence of which
would not have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

2.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Seller has full corporate power
and corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller is a party, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The board of directors of Seller (and, to the
extent required by applicable Law or the organizational documents of each
Subsidiary of Seller transferring any Assets and Properties pursuant to this
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, each such Subsidiary of Seller and its
shareholders) have approved this Agreement and the execution and delivery by
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which Seller or such Subsidiary is a party and the consummation
by Seller and its Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and the performance by Seller and its Subsidiaries of its and their
obligations hereunder and thereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action by Seller and such Subsidiary, as applicable,
and no other action on the part of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and the consummation by Seller and its Subsidiaries
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
have been or will be, as applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered
by Seller or such Subsidiary, as applicable, and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof (and, in the case of the

will constitute, as applicable, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Seller or such Subsidiary enforceable against Seller or such Subsidiary in
accordance with its respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity. Seller has the power and
authority to cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to comply with the
obligations contemplated in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
perform the transactions contemplated to be performed by such Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Subsidiaries own, are in possession of, and have good title to each of the
Purchased Assets and each of the Licensed IP Assets that they purport to own
and valid leasehold interests in each of the Purchased Assets that they
purport to lease, good title or valid license rights to each of the Licensed
IP Assets that they purport to license, and valid rights under Contract with
respect to the Purchased Assets that they purport to hold (or that arise)
under Contracts, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Exceptions and non-exclusive Licenses granted to customers and partners in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The Purchased
Assets, together with the Licensed IP Assets, constitute all of the material
Assets and Properties used or held for use by Seller and its Subsidiaries in
the Business and all of the Assets and Properties required for Purchaser to
conduct the Business immediately after the Closing Date without interruption
in the ordinary course of business as it has heretofore been conducted by
Seller without giving effect to any changes in the conduct of the Business by
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
foregoing is not intended by either Party to address issues of infringement
of third-party Intellectual Property Rights, which are addressed in _Section
2.11_ below. The Purchased Technology includes, in the aggregate, all material
Technology that is exclusively related to the Business. Upon execution and
delivery by Seller to Purchaser of the instruments of sale, assignment,
transfer and conveyance referred to in _Section 1.1_, Purchaser will become
the true and lawful owner of, and will receive good title to, the Purchased
Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens (if any) arising solely
on account of Purchasers actions or omissions and other than licenses to
which any of the Purchased IP Assets may be subject, as disclosed in _Section
2.11(d)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. The Asset Schedules accurately
set forth, for each material Purchased Asset, the location and whether such
asset is owned by Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller, and, if owned by a
Subsidiary, the identity and jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary.
_Schedules 10.1(CBP), 10.1(PBP) and 10.1(RBP)_ , taken in the aggregate, set
forth a true, correct and complete list of all of the past and present
products commercialized, or products currently planned to be designed or
developed for commercialization, by Seller or its Subsidiaries in the
Purchaser Field.

2.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller is a party do not, and Sellers
and its Subsidiaries performance of (or compliance with) their obligations
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not:

together with the EU Continuing Employees, being referred to herein as the "
_Continuing Employees_ "). The terms offered to each such Business

Subsidiaries may have against any such Continuing Employee under any such
confidentiality agreement, or against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or

transferring Employee_." Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its
Affiliates harmless with respect to all Liabilities relating to any Non-

benefits, excluding EU Transferring Employees, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure such resignations, waivers, releases and
agreements as may be required to permit the employment by Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries of the Business Employees listed in _Schedule 5.7(a_ ) (and no

Employees shall carry over to Purchaser all accrued and unused vacation time
in accordance with applicable Law. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the value of all vacation time carried over by Continuing
Employees to Purchaser, calculated on the basis of each Continuing Employees
base compensation rate as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(or on such other basis, if higher, as Seller actually uses in calculating the
payments it makes or is required to make to Continuing Employees pursuant to
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.7(d)(i)_). At least two (2)
Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
certificate of Sellers chief financial officer setting forth the amount of

accrued vacation time.

Closing Date, Seller shall cause the tax-qualified pension and 401(k) plans in
which Continuing Employees were eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Closing Date to fully vest such employees accrued benefit through the
Closing Date thereunder.

(iii) _Bonuses_. For Continuing Employees located in China and Taiwan who are
eligible (pursuant to their existing employment terms) to receive a bonus
equal to one (1) month or two (2) months (as applicable) of such Continuing
Employees salary (the " _Month Bonus_ "), in lieu of Seller paying the
accrued and unpaid amount of such Month Bonus as of the Closing Date (the "
_Accrued Bonus Amount_ ") on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall carry over the
Accrued Bonus Amount and pay the applicable Accrued Bonus Amount to
the Continuing Employee in accordance with such Continuing Employees
existing employment terms. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the aggregate Accrued Bonus Amount for all applicable Continuing
Employees. At least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate of Sellers chief financial officer
setting forth the aggregate amount of the Accrued Bonus Amount for each
Continuing Employee.

($8,000,000)), (D) the underlying calculations of the amounts under clauses
(B) and (C), and (E) a summary description of the reason that severance is
payable (" _Severance Liability List_ "). For purposes of this _Section
5.7(g)_, Seller shall be responsible to Purchaser for an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total severance amount paid or due to each Terminated
Continuing Employee, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of months that such Terminated Continuing Employee was employed by
Seller, and the denominator of which is the total number of months that such
Terminated Continuing Employee was employed by Seller (and/or a Subsidiary of
Seller) and Purchaser (and/or a Subsidiary of Purchaser). Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing, Seller shall be responsible for severance of
Terminated Continuing Employees solely under the terms of (and shall not
exceed the amounts payable under) Sellers severance plans and programs in
existence as of the Closing Date and under statutory severance obligations in
existence as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, in determining the amount of severance for which Seller shall
be responsible, the amount of severance payable to Terminated Continuing
Employees shall be calculated as if such severance were payable pursuant to
the severance plans of Seller and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof (or, if greater, on the Closing Date) and under severance statutes as
in effect as of the Closing Date.

(ii) As soon as practicable, Seller shall review and confirm the accuracy of
the Severance Liability List. If Seller disputes the accuracy of the
Severance Liability List, Seller shall deliver a written notice (" _Severance
Liability List Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser before 5 p.m. Pacific Time on
the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery of the Severance Liability List
(" _Severance Liability List Review Period_ ").

Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to
the omitted portions. (iii) If Seller delivers a Severance Liability List Dispute Notice to
Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Severance Liability List Review
Period, then Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the accuracy of the Severance Liability List. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to reach agreement on the accuracy of the Severance Liability List
within twenty (20) days after the expiration of the Severance Liability List
Review Period, either Seller or Purchaser may demand arbitration of the
dispute. The dispute shall be resolved by three (3) arbitrators, one selected
by Seller, one selected by Purchaser, and the third selected jointly by the
two arbitrators previously selected by Seller and Purchaser. The decision of a
majority of the three (3) arbitrators as to the accuracy of the Severance
Liability List shall be binding and conclusive upon Seller and Purchaser. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions of law regarding the dispute which shall set forth the
judgment of the arbitrators.

(iv) Judgment to enforce the decision rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration
shall be held in a location within the Northern District of California under
the commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. Each Party shall pay its own expenses, including attorneys
fees. The expenses and fees of each arbitrator and the administrative costs of
the arbitration and the expenses shall be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser.

(h) _No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights_. No provision of this _Section 5.7_
shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee, or
any beneficiary or dependents thereof, including the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to any Continuing
Employee or under any employee benefit plan which Purchaser may maintain.

5.8 _Personal Information_. Any personal information (as defined by applicable
privacy Laws) about Business Employees which is disclosed to Purchaser by
Seller for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement (including the
employment of such individuals by the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time), shall be held by Purchaser in confidence and shall not be
used, disclosed or retained by Purchaser for any other purposes, and shall
otherwise be handled by Purchaser in compliance in all material respects with
applicable privacy Laws.

5.9 _Preservation of Records_. Seller and Purchaser agree that each of them
shall preserve and keep the records held by it or their Affiliates relating
to the Business for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and
shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such Party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, legal proceedings against or governmental investigations
of Seller or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Seller
or Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement
and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.9_ to the contrary,
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to provide access to any
information or materials required by Law or by agreements with third parties
to be kept confidential. In the case of material protected by the attorney-
client privilege or work product immunity, Seller or Purchaser (as the case
may be) may, prior to and as a condition of furnishing such material, require
the recipient to enter into a reasonably appropriate agreement intended to
preserve such privileges and immunities.

the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of any business, whether in

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted
to acquire a majority equity or other majority ownership interest of a Person
whose principal line of business is not a Restricted Business, but which has
a division or other operations constituting a Restricted Business (any such
division or operations, an " _Acquired Competing Interest_ "), _provided_ that
(i) the annual gross sales or revenues from such Restricted Business do not
exceed twenty five million dollars ($25,000,000) and in any event such gross
sales or revenues from such Restricted Business do not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the total annual gross sales or revenues of such Person for
the last completed fiscal year of such Person, and (ii) Seller shall or shall

Acquired Competing Interest within six (6) months after the acquisition by
Seller and its Subsidiaries of the Acquired Competing Interest, then Seller
shall immediately cause the operations of the Acquired Competing Interest to
be ceased. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the
remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that
Purchaser, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.

(b) For a period from the date hereof to the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to (i)
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries who are or become employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to leave such
employment with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or (ii) hire, employ
or otherwise engage any such individual.

(c) In addition to and without in any way limiting the obligations and
restrictions set forth in _Section 5.10(b)_, Seller agrees that for a period
of one (1) year from and after the Effective Time, neither Seller nor any
Subsidiary of Seller will, directly or indirectly, solicit to employ any
employee of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries who was first introduced to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with (i) the negotiation of
this Agreement or (ii) the performance by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
of the Transition Services Agreement. The foregoing shall not prohibit or
prevent Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from soliciting any employee of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries: (A) through general solicitations in

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, (C) who first contacts Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries on his or her own initiative, (D) who (x) is no longer employed
by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) has provided notice of his or
her resignation without solicitation by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
(z) has received written notice from Purchaser or the Subsidiary of Purchaser
where he or she is employed of his or her impending termination, or (E) after
the date which is three (3) months after the date on which Purchaser enters
into an agreement for a sale by Purchaser (whether by sale of stock or assets,
or otherwise) of the division, business unit, department or other operational
area in which such employee is employed. In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this _Section 5.10(c)_ and _Section 5.10(b)_, _Section
5.10(b)_ shall control.

(d) Purchaser agrees that for a period of one (1) year from and after the
Effective Time, neither Purchaser nor any Subsidiary of Purchaser will,
directly or indirectly, solicit to employ any current employee of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries who was first introduced to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with (i) the negotiation of this Agreement or (ii)
the performance by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of the Transition
Services Agreement. The foregoing shall not prohibit or prevent Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries from soliciting any employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries: (A) through general solicitations in newspaper, trade, internet
or other advertisements, job fairs or similar methods, (B) through a third-
party recruiter, _provided_ that neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries
provides such third-party recruiter with the name, title or position of any
such employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries obtained in connection with the

Agreement, (C) who first contacts Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries on his

solicitation by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or (z) has received
written notice from Seller or the Subsidiary where he or she is employed of
his or her impending termination, or (E) after the date which is three (3)
months after the date on which Seller enters into an agreement for a sale by
Seller (whether by sale of stock or assets or otherwise) of the division,
business unit, department or other operational area in which such employee is
employed. The rights and interests of Seller and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
this _Section 5.10(d)_ may not be assigned by Seller or its Subsidiaries (by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(which consent may be withheld in Purchasers sole discretion) and any
attempt to assign such rights and interests without consent shall be void.

(e) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 5.10_ relate
to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 5.10_ will cause irreparable
injury to the parties, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, each Party
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining
order or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in
the event of any breach of this

are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in equity. In the event that
Purchaser were to seek damages for any breach of this _Section 5.10_, the
portion of the consideration delivered by Purchaser to Seller (or to others at
the direction of Seller) hereunder which is attributed by the parties to the
foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit on such
damages.

(f) Purchaser and Seller intend and agree that (i) the covenants set forth in
this _Section 5.10_ shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one
for each country in the world where the Business (or any portion thereof) is
located or conducted, including the United States of America, Canada, India,
the Peoples Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
United Kingdom, and France, and one for each state and province within such
countries (including the State of California and the Commonwealths of
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and the Province of Ontario); (ii) if any court
of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a
specified time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business
limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section 5.10_ is
unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time period,
geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is
determined to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may
be enforced against the applicable Party; and (iii) if, in any Action or
Proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants
deemed included in this _Section 5.10_, even after giving effect to clause
(ii), then such unenforceable covenant shall be deemed eliminated from these
provisions for the purpose of such Action or Proceeding to the extent
necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced.

(g) The parties agree to allocate the aggregate sum of one dollar ($1.00) of
the consideration of the Purchased Assets to the agreements, covenants and
undertakings contained in _Section 5.10_ for the purposes of the ITA and the

paragraph 56.4(3)(c) of the ITA (and analogous provincial or territorial tax
legislation) in the form of "Election for Restrictive Covenants" attached
hereto as _Exhibit N_ , or in such successor form as may be prescribed by the
Canada Revenue Agency, which shall be filed in accordance with proposed
subsection 56.4(14) of the ITA.

notice to Purchaser of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the

or warranty of Seller in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or
prior to the Closing in any material respect and (b) any failure of Seller in
any material respect to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and Purchaser
shall give prompt written notice to Seller of (x) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely
to cause any representation or warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing in any material respect and
(y) any failure of Purchaser in any material respect to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.11_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to the Party receiving such notice.

Intellectual Property Rights or Technology of the Person responsible for the
IP Communication or the holder of the Intellectual Property Rights or

Taxes or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates related

continue to occupy during Purchasers lease or sublease of a portion thereof,
each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the

7.2 _Indemnification; Escrow Provisions_.

(a) _Establishment of the Escrow Fund_. At the Closing, without any act of

any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or instrument
delivered in connection herewith or therewith or any claim by any third party

Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith or any claim by any
third party alleging, constituting or involving such a breach, violation or
inaccuracy, or (y) any of the Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser and Seller each
acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Closing, which if resolved at the Closing would
have led to a reduction in the Purchase Price.

(c) _Certain Limitations_.

(i) Except as otherwise provided herein, an Indemnified Party may not make
any claim for indemnification for Losses in excess of the Cap resulting from
the breach or violation of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement (or contained, incorporated or referred to in any
certificate delivered in connection therewith), and, further, an Indemnified
Party may not make any claim for indemnification for any breach or violation
of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty unless and until the
aggregate Losses paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued (or anticipated or
be paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued) exceed two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") (at which time claims may be
made and indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without regard to, and
without deducting or subtracting, the Threshold Amount). For purposes of this
_Article 7_ , all materiality and Business Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations and warranties contained in _Article 2_
or contained, incorporated or referred to in the certificate related thereto
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ shall be disregarded for purposes of
calculating the amount of such Losses, but shall not be disregarded for
purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in _Article 2_ (or contained, incorporated or referred to in the
certificate delivered pursuant to  _Section 6.3(c))_ has occurred. Neither
the Cap nor the Threshold Amount shall apply to claims for indemnification (A)
by an Indemnified Party for Losses resulting from fraud or willful breach by
the Indemnifying Party or any Person who is or was a director, officer,
Affiliate or stockholder of the Indemnifying Party in

therewith, (B) by Purchaser for Losses resulting from any of the Excluded
Assets or Retained Liabilities (in the case of indemnification claims by
Purchaser related thereto), (C) by Seller for Losses resulting from any of the
Assumed Liabilities (in the case of indemnification claims by Seller related
thereto), (D) by Purchaser for any Losses for which Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Sections 1.8,
5.5, 5.6 or 5.7_ , (D) by Purchaser for Losses resulting from any Excepted
Matter or (F) by Purchaser for Losses resulting from any of the matters
referred to in _Schedule 7.2(b)(iv)_ , any and all of which shall be
recoverable by the applicable Indemnified Party without respect to the Cap or
the Threshold Amount (other than Item 5 under Part II of _Schedule 7.2(b)(iv)_
, which shall be subject to the Cap but not the Threshold).

(ii) In the event of any conflict between the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement, on the one hand, and the provisions of the Transition
Services Agreement or the related statements of work attached thereto, on the
other hand, the provisions of the Transition Services Agreement and the
applicable statement of work shall control, but solely with respect to
the indemnification for obligations expressly and exclusively established by
the Transition Services Agreement and related statements of work attached
thereto and not with respect to any other matter or obligation (as to each of
which this Agreement shall govern, control and prevail).

(iii) For Losses that are not subject to the Cap and are not for Excepted
Matters as defined in _Section 7.2(c)(v)_, the maximum respective liability
of each of Seller and Purchaser under this _Article 7_ shall be equal to the
Purchase Price.

(iv) To the extent that any Loss that is the subject of a claim for
indemnification under this _Article 7_ is compensated by insurance proceeds
paid to an Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ only with respect to the amount
of Losses that are in excess of the cash proceeds received by
such Indemnified Party pursuant to such insurance, after deducting therefrom
the expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in obtaining such proceeds and
the amount of any increase in premiums payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of the claims made against such insurance in relation to such matter
(" _Net Insurance Proceeds_ "). If such Indemnified Party receives such cash
insurance proceeds prior to the time such claim is paid, then the amount
payable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to such claim shall be reduced by
the amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds. If such Indemnified Party receives
such cash insurance proceeds after such claim is paid, then upon receipt by
such Indemnified Party of any cash proceeds pursuant to such insurance with
respect to such claim, such Indemnified Party shall repay any portion of such
Net Insurance Proceeds which was previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to
such the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim. 

(v) Absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and other than for Excepted
Matters (as defined below), the indemnification provisions contained in this
_Article 7_ are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy following
the Closing as to all Losses any Indemnified Party may incur arising from or
relating to breaches and violations of, and

Assumed Liabilities, or either Partys responsibilities, obligations
and liabilities in respect of its respective covenants, agreements and

performed at or after the Closing (each an " _Excepted Matter_ " and
collectively, the " _Excepted Matters_ ").

(d) _Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination of Escrow
Period_. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the Expiration Date (the period of time from the
Effective Time through and including 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the
Expiration Date is referred to herein as the " _Escrow Period_ "), and all
property thereafter remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed as set
forth in the last sentence of this _Section 7.2(d_); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount as
may be necessary in the good faith judgment of Purchaser, subject to the
objection of Seller and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner
as provided in  _Section 7.2(h)_, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims under
this _Section 7.2_ concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the
termination of the Escrow Period which claims are specified in any Officers
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the Escrow
Period. Promptly after all such claims, if any, have been resolved, Purchaser
and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims.

(e) _Protection of Escrow Fund; Interest Income_.

(i) Purchaser and Seller shall require the Escrow Agent to hold and safeguard
the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, to treat such fund as a trust fund
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to hold and dispose of the
Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be
invested only in obligations of (or guaranteed by) the U.S. Government as
to principal and interest, or such other investments as Purchaser and Seller
shall direct in joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and
Seller agree that in no event shall the Escrow Agent have any liability under
the Escrow Agreement for investment losses incurred on any investment or
reinvestment made in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller agree
that the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any market loss on any
investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a payment required
hereunder.

_Investment Income_ ") shall be deemed for Tax purposes to constitute (and
shall be reported as) income of Seller. Such Investment Income shall be deemed
part of the Escrow Fund, subject to claims for indemnification and
distributions to Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, in each case in
accordance with this _Article 7_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and
Seller agree that twenty percent (20%) of the amount of such Investment Income
in each calendar quarter shall automatically be deducted from such income and
paid as a distribution by the Escrow Agent to Seller out of the Escrow Fund on
the last day of each calendar quarter, without regard to the procedures of
_Section 7.2(f), (g), or (h)_. Except for the Investment Income, unless and
until distributed to Seller (and then only to the extent distributed to
Seller), the Parties agree to treat the Escrow Fund as owned by Purchaser and
not received by Seller and to file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
such treatment.

(f) _Claims for Indemnification; Claims Upon Escrow Fund_. Claims
for indemnification shall be made by delivery of a certificate signed by any
officer of the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party (an " _Officer s
Certificate_"). Each Officers Certificate: (i) shall state, in substance,

in the case of indemnification claims involving anticipated Losses, that the
Indemnified Party anticipates in good faith that it will pay, incur, sustain
and/or accrue) Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of (A) any breach
or violation of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty (either as
made on the date hereof or as if made on and as of the Closing Date, other
than representations and warranties that by their express terms are made
solely as of a specified earlier date, as to which the Officers Certificate
shall state that the Losses are a result of a breach, violation or inaccuracy
as of such specified earlier date), or any breach or violation of any
covenant or agreement, made by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party in this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party in connection
herewith or therewith, or any claim by any third party alleging, constituting
or involving such a breach, violation or inaccuracy, (B) any of the Excluded
Assets or Retained Liabilities (in the case of indemnification claims by
Purchaser related thereto) or any of the Assumed Liabilities (in the case of

which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement (including, in the case of Purchaser, _Sections 1.8, 5.5, 5.6 or
5.7_ ), or (D) any matter referred to in _Schedule 7.2(b)(iv)_; and (ii)
shall specify in reasonable detail the individual items of Loss included in
the amount so stated, the date (if known) when each such item of Loss was
paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued (or, in the case of anticipated
Losses, the basis for such anticipated Loss), and the general nature of the
representation, warranty, agreement, covenant, Excluded Asset, Retained
Liability, Assumed Liability, or other matter to which such item of Loss or
anticipated Loss is related.

(g) _Objections to Claims_. A copy of the Officers Certificate shall be
delivered to the Indemnifying Party and, in the case of indemnification claims

Officers Certificate in which to object, in whole or in part, to the
indemnification claim(s) set forth in the Officers Certificate. Objection
shall be made by a

setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for objection, which shall be
delivered to the Indemnified Party (and, the case of indemnification claims
involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent) prior to 5:00
p.m. Pacific Time on the last day of such twenty (20) Business Day period. In
the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund,
if compliant objection in writing is made and timely delivered in accordance
with the requirements of this _Section 7.2(g)_, Purchaser and Seller agree
that the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to the Indemnified Party of any
portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ unless the Escrow
Agent shall have received written authorization from the Indemnifying Party to
make such delivery. If compliant objection in writing is not made or is not
timely delivered in accordance with the requirements of this _Section
7.2(g)_, Purchaser and Seller shall require the Escrow Agent, as promptly as
practicable following the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period,
to pay to the Indemnified Party, from the Escrow Fund, an amount in cash equal
to the amount of Losses claimed against the Escrow Fund in the Officers
Certificate, in accordance with  _Section 7.2(f)_; _provided_ , that where
the basis for a claim is that the Indemnified Party anticipates that it will
pay, incur, sustain and/or accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the
Escrow Fund for such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid,
incurred, sustained and/or accrued.

(h) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_. 

(i) If the Indemnifying Party has objected in writing to any claim or claims
made in any Officers Certificate in accordance with the procedures of
_Section 7.2(g)_, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both parties and, in the case of indemnification claims
involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, a copy thereof shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Seller agree that the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and to distribute funds
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

(ii) If no such agreement is reached after good-faith negotiations, the
Indemnified Party (or, in the case of indemnification claims involving a
claim against the Escrow Fund, either the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party) may demand arbitration of the dispute. If the amount of the
Loss is at issue in a pending Action or Proceeding involving a Third-Party
Claim (as defined in _Section 7.2(i)_), arbitration shall not be commenced
until such amount is determined in such Action or Proceeding (whether by
verdict, judgment, finding of fact, settlement or other order, stipulation or
agreement) or otherwise ascertained, or both parties agree to arbitration.
Any dispute regarding a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_
that is reasonably expected to require, for its determination, the application
or determination of a substantive issue of patent law, shall, at the request
of either Party, be resolved by special confidential arbitration pursuant to
the rules set forth in _Schedule 7.2(h)(ii)_. Otherwise, the dispute shall be
resolved by three arbitrators, one selected by the Indemnified Party, one
selected by the Indemnifying Party, and the third selected jointly by the two
arbitrators previously selected by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, in accordance with the following provisions and procedures:

Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to
the omitted portions. (A) The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures
designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery of information relating to
any dispute while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as determined
in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from
the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.

(B) The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel, limit or allow
discovery as they shall deem appropriate given the nature and extent of the
disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys fees and other costs incurred by the parties,
to the same extent as a court of law or equity, if the arbitrators determine
that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery
was refused or objected to by a Party without substantial justification.

(C) The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and (in the case of
indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund),
notwithstanding anything in _Section 7.2(g)_, Purchaser and Seller agree that
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision
and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of
fact and conclusions of law regarding the dispute which shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrators.

(D) Judgment upon any award, judgment, decree or order rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any
such arbitration shall be held in a location within the Northern District of
California under the commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this _Section 7.2(h)_, in
any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in
the Officers Certificate is at issue, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed
to be the non-prevailing party if the arbitrators award the Indemnified Party
less than one-half of the disputed amount of claimed Losses (exclusive of any
amounts not in dispute); otherwise, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall
pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of
the arbitration and the expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
costs, incurred by the other Party to the arbitration.

(iii) _Confidentiality_. In connection with indemnification and arbitration
matters pursuant to this _Article 7_ (including pursuant to _Schedule
7.2(h)(ii)_ ), each Party and its Representatives shall hold in strict
confidence, shall not use for any purpose other than as permitted under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and shall not disclose to any Person,
any nonpublic information from or concerning the other Party, concerning any
of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities (in the case of Seller) or
Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities (in the case of Purchaser) (including
information obtained in the course of any arbitration, in discovery pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(h)_ or concerning the Escrow Fund or claims for
indemnification (including information concerning the assertion, existence,
nature, amount, status or outcome of any claim, objection, communication or
proceeding under this _Article 7_ ).

such disclosures as are reasonably required in good faith for the conduct
of proceedings for the resolution of disputes relating to indemnification
claims, for the enforcement of arbitration awards and judgments related
thereto, (ii) to disclose such information to their Representatives and other
Persons who reasonably need to know such information for the purpose of

enabling an Indemnified Party to respond or pursue an objection to an
indemnification claim and who have agreed in writing to the same
confidentiality obligations and disclosure restrictions applicable to the
Parties hereto) and (iii) to make such disclosures as required by Law
(including federal and state securities Laws) or by stock exchange rules. 

(i) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an Indemnified Party is served
with a complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in litigation (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ ") which the Indemnified Party expects may result in a claim for
indemnification under this _Article 7_ or a demand against the Escrow Fund,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its own and sole
expense, to participate in any defense of such Third-Party Claim. Purchaser
shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to control the
defense of any Third-Party Claim against Purchaser and Purchaser shall
thereafter from time to time promptly provide to Seller copies of all
pleadings filed and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to
such Third-Party Claim, and shall consult in good faith with Seller at
reasonable periodic intervals on matters regarding the defense of such Third-
Party Claim. Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
any such Third-Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the amount of
any settlement shall only be indemnifiable if made with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party or, if made without the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
the amount of the settlement was not unreasonably high, does not result in
the Indemnifying Party incurring any obligations other than its
indemnification obligations hereunder or the settlement was not agreed to in
bad faith and without any reasonable basis, (ii) the amount of any settlement
shall not be determinative of the amount of Losses (if any) that are subject
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ and (iii) in no event shall
Purchaser settle any claim related to the matter set forth in  _Item 5 of
Part II of Schedule 7.2(b)(iv)_ without the consent of Seller. If a Third-
Party Claim in a pending Action or Proceeding against an Indemnified Party
would reasonably be expected to result in a claim for indemnification
under this _Article 7_ , then, at the Indemnifying Partys written request
within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the institution or pendency
of such Action or Proceeding, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter
from time to time promptly provide to the Indemnified Party copies of all
pleadings filed and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to
such Third-Party Claim and shall thereafter consult in good faith with the
Indemnifying Party at reasonable periodic intervals on matters relating to
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, and (B) the Indemnifying Party may,
with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, assume
control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim if, and only if, (w) the
Third-Party Claim is asserted by a Person other than a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, is solely for actual monetary damages (and not for
punitive, exemplary or similar damages, treble damages or other damages in
excess of actual damages), does not seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive or
other equitable relief, or specific performance, and the total monetary
damages that may be awarded with respect to such Third-Party Claim do not

strategic partner of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries and is not party to
a material business relationship with the Indemnifying Party that may create
a material risk of a conflict between the interests of the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, (y) the Third-Party Claim does not involve a criminal, quasi-criminal
or regulatory matter, and (z) no later than twenty (20) days after notice by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have notified the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election to assume such defense and shall have
acknowledged unconditionally that such Third-Party Claim is subject to
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article 7_. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of such a
Third-Party Claim, (AA) the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter from time to
time promptly provide to the Indemnified Party copies of all pleadings filed
and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to such Third-
Party Claim, and shall consult in good faith with the Indemnified Party at
reasonable periodic intervals on matters regarding the defense of such Third-
Party Claim; (BB) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate

of any such Third-Party Claim (other than a settlement solely for payment of
money within the amounts set forth in clause (B)(w) above that contains a
full release in favor of the Indemnified Party and its Subsidiaries). If
thereafter the Third-Party Claim shall be amended or supplemented such that it
no longer meets the criteria set forth in clauses (A) through (B) above, or if
at any time after the assumption of control of defense the Indemnifying Party
is failing, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party after written
notice to the Indemnifying Party and reasonable opportunity for cure, to
pursue the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and
vigor, the Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnifying
Party, re-assume the control and conduct of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. Where an Action or Proceeding also involves claims that are not
subject to indemnification under this _Article 7_ , the Indemnifying Partys
rights with respect to control of defense shall not extend to claims that are
not subject to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Purchaser shall have the right (and, at Sellers request, the
obligation) to conduct and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim to the
extent that it is for (and is acknowledged by Purchaser to be) an Assumed
Liability and Seller shall have the right (and, at Purchasers request, the
obligation) to conduct and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim to the
extent that it is for (and is acknowledged by Seller to be) a Retained
Liability.
