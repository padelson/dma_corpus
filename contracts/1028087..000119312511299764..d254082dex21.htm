-v-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
November 4, 2011, by and among JLL Crown Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Buyer"), JLL Crown Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory
Subsidiary"), and American Dental Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Company deems it advisable and in the best interests of
such corporation and its stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company;

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger of
the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company, with the Company being
the survivor of such merger, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as a result of which
the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and
into the Company (the "Merger") at the Effective Time.

 

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Company shall cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and
executed by the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to
effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as is agreed to by the Buyer and the Company and set forth
in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

 

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of items to be
delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that
the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such
items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 399 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by
the Buyer and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), then the
Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (a) any Business Day before
or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by the Buyer on no less
than two (2) Business Days prior notice to the Company and (b) the final day
of the Marketing Period. By mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Company, the
Closing may

 



1  take place by conference call and exchange of faxes and/or e-mails of
documents in .pdf format. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day"
shall be any day on which the principal offices of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in Washington, DC are open to accept filings,
other than a day on which banking institutions located in New York, New York
are permitted or required by applicable Law to remain closed.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company, with the Company, following the Effective
Time, continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger (sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and (b) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated, by virtue of the Merger, to read as set
forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, and, as so amended and restated, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with its terms and
the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.8(b) hereof, the Buyer shall
cause the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in
their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are
identical to the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the
Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the
Company, and, as so amended and restated, such By-laws shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $19.00 in cash per
share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be

 



2  outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer
(other than the Transitory Subsidiary) or the Company shall remain outstanding
following the Merger.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a bank or trust company mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange
Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to
make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in
exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Exchange Fund").

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly pay to the holder of such Certificate in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than
any Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Buyer may cause any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock for six months after the Effective Time to be delivered to the Buyer,
upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter be entitled to
receive only from the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration.

 



3 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by
the Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
the Buyer may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Buyer shall cause the
Exchange Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock granted subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section 2.3(b)
below) (each, a "Restricted Share"), that is outstanding and subject to such
restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically vest,
and the Companys reacquisition right with respect to each Restricted Share
shall lapse, and the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II
(including Section 2.2(f)), be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each such Restricted Share.

 

(b) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under any stock option plans or other
equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans") to be
accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(ii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option, except for such Company
Stock Options with respect to which the Buyer and the holder thereof agree
otherwise (the "Rollover Options"), to represent as of the Effective Time
solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3 and subject
to Section 2.2(f), a lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option
Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect to such Company Stock
Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock
or any other equity security of the Company, the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

 

(c) Each Company Stock Option that is not a Rollover Option (a "Cancelled
Stock Option") shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and each holder
of a Cancelled Stock Option shall receive from the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each such Cancelled Stock
Option, as soon as

 



4  practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than
five Business Days thereafter), an amount (net of applicable taxes withheld
pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any,
of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Cancelled
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Cancelled Stock Option (whether or not then vested or
exercisable), without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). In
the event that the exercise price of any Cancelled Stock Option is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Cancelled Stock Option shall be
cancelled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and
have no further force or effect.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Rollover Option, if any, shall be
automatically converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of a holder thereof, to an option to purchase common stock
(or common units in the case of a non-corporate entity) of any direct or
indirect parent of the Surviving Corporation, with the number of shares or
units underlying such option, and the applicable exercise price, equitably
adjusted to prevent any increase or decrease in the intrinsic value of such
Rollover Option as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Following the execution of this Agreement, (i) if and as required by the
Company Stock Plans, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of
Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for
Cancelled Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Cancelled Stock
Options and (ii) the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.3 and to terminate
the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time (including any necessary or
appropriate Company Board action). The Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time
maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of
Cancelled Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3.

(f) The Company shall take any and all actions necessary under the Companys
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to prevent the commencement of any new offering
periods thereunder following the date hereof and prior to the Closing.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly made a demand
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time
as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal
rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall, subject to Section
2.4(b), not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL or otherwise), then the right of
the holder of such Dissenting Shares to be paid such consideration as is
determined due pursuant to the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and
shall represent only, the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except such rights provided in this Section
2.4.

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice
or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to
control, and make decisions in respect of, all negotiations

 



5  and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer
shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") or as disclosed in any Company SEC
Report filed on or after January 1, 2010 and prior to the date hereof and
only as and to the extent disclosed therein (the "Filed Company SEC Reports"),
other than disclosure in the Filed Company SEC Reports referred to in the
"Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Statements" sections thereof or any
statements included in such Filed Company SEC Reports that are forward-looking
in nature:

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties, rights and assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and (b) is duly qualified to do
business and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties, rights and assets it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except, solely in the case
of clause (b), for such failures to be so qualified or in good standing that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event,
circumstance or development, in each case that, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such changes, events, circumstances or developments,
is, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse with respect to,
or has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect
on, the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the
following, or any change, event, circumstance or development arising or
resulting from any of the following, shall constitute, or shall constitute a
basis for determining that there has occurred, a Company Material Adverse
Effect:

 

(a) general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or
region in the world, or conditions in the global economy generally;

(b) conditions in the securities markets, credit markets, currency markets or
other financial markets in the United States or any other country or region
in the world, including (i) changes in interest rates in the United States or
any other country or region in the world and changes in exchange rates for the
currencies of any countries and (ii) any suspension of trading in securities
(whether equity, debt, derivative or hybrid securities) generally on any
securities exchange or over-the-counter market operating in the United States
or any other country or region in the world; 

(c) conditions in the industries or markets in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate;

 

(d) political conditions in the United States or any other country or region
in the world or acts of war, sabotage or terrorism (including any escalation
or general worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism) in the
United States or any other country or region in the world;

(e) earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides, wild
fires or other natural disasters, weather conditions and other force majeure
events in the United States or any other country or region in the world;

(f) other than for purposes of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c) and, to the extent related thereto, the
condition in Section 7.2(a), the public announcement of this

 



6  Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the impact thereof on relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with dental groups, dental professionals or their
patients, vendors, suppliers or employees;

(g) changes in Laws or other legal or regulatory conditions (or the
interpretation thereof) or changes in GAAP or other accounting standards (or
the interpretation thereof), in each case arising after the date of this
Agreement, or that result from any action reasonably required to be taken
to comply with any of the foregoing;

(h) any action taken or failure to take action, in each case, that the Buyer
has approved, consented to or requested in writing;

(i) any fees or expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(j) any (i) changes in the Companys stock price or the trading volume of the
Companys stock, or (ii) failure by the Company to meet any public estimates
or expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations for any period, or (iii) failure by the
Company to meet any internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations (but in each
case described in any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), the
underlying cause of such changes or failures may be considered in determining
whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect, unless such changes
or failures would otherwise be excepted from this definition); and

 

(k) any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

provided, however, that any change, event, circumstance or development
referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) may be taken into
account in determining whether or not there has been a Company Material
Adverse Effect to the extent such change, event, circumstance or development
has a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

other equity interests of, or voting interests in, the Company or any
security or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
such shares or other equity interests or voting rights, or obligating the

value of, or otherwise relating to, the capital stock of the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting (including voting
trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer (including agreements imposing
transfer restrictions) of any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and except
to the extent arising pursuant to applicable state takeover or similar Laws,
there are no registration rights, and there is no rights agreement, "poison
pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar agreement or understanding to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or they are
bound with respect to any equity security of any class of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(d) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares of
Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Section 3.2(b) above,
upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any

Company Common Stock or the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to provide funds to, or make any material investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company or any other person for any such purpose other
than as provided in award agreements relating to Company Stock Options or
Restricted Shares as they relate to using shares of Company Common Stock to
pay the exercise price thereof or to pay required withholding of income
Taxes.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there was no outstanding indebtedness
for borrowed money of the Company or its Subsidiaries other than as reflected
in the Company Balance Sheet or incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent in all material respects with past practice (the "Ordinary
Course of Business") after the date of the Company Balance Sheet.

all necessary corporate action, (ii) each grant was made in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, all applicable Laws, and the
rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and (iii) the per

liability company or other non-corporate business enterprise in which such
party (or another Subsidiary of such party) holds stock or other ownership
interests representing (i) more than 50% of the voting power of all
outstanding stock or ownership interests of such entity or (ii) the right to
receive more than 50% of the net assets of such entity available for
distribution to the holders of outstanding stock or ownership interests upon a

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign company (to the extent such concepts are
applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good
standing that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity securities or interests
of each Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares are
owned, of record and beneficially, by the Company or another of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations on the Companys voting rights,
charges or other encumbrances. There are no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or that are binding on any of them providing for the
issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of
the Company. There is no outstanding equity compensation with respect to any
Subsidiary of the Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of any capital stock
of any Subsidiary of the Company.

or indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
business association or entity that is not a Subsidiary of the Company.

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company

and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be subject to any state takeover Law or similar Law that
might otherwise apply to such execution, delivery, performance or
consummation. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary in Section 4.6, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,

9  Company Stockholder Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of

subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception").

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated

breach of, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Company or of the charter, by-laws or other organizational document of any
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) subject to obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Vote and compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (i)

or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, or obligation or fee
under, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, license,
lease, sublease or other instrument or obligation (each, a "Contract") to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective
properties are bound or result in the creation of any Lien on the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties, rights or assets, except,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.4(b), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, losses, rights or other occurrences
that would not (A) prevent or materially delay the Company from performing
its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect or (B) have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity or
any stock market or stock exchange on which shares of Company Common Stock
are listed for trading is required by or with respect to the Company or any of

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under applicable state securities laws and (v) such other consents, approvals,
licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations,
notices and filings that, if not obtained or made, would not (A) prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect or (B) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary in Section 4.6, the affirmative vote for
adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the holders of at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on the record date for
determination of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of the
Companys stockholders (the "Company Meeting") to consider the Company Voting
Proposal (the "Required Company Stockholder Vote") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock or other
securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.

case of unaudited interim financial statements, as permitted by the SEC on
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented or will fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments, none of which are expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The consolidated audited balance sheet of the
Company as of December 31, 2010 is referred to herein as the "Company Balance
Sheet."

 

(c) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion in the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Company Meeting (as amended or supplemented

therein, the "Proxy Statement") shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company or on any other date of filing
with the SEC, or at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any statement
that, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein
not false or misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were or
shall be made; or, with respect to the Proxy Statement, omit to state any

material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Affiliate", when used with respect to any party,
means any person who is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of
Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material
information concerning the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The
Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (a) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal controls

 



11  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (b) any
fraud, to the Companys Knowledge, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made available to
the Buyer all such disclosures made by management to the Companys auditors
and audit committee from January 1, 2010 to the date of this Agreement. As of
the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers of the
Company within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended and including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). Since January 1, 2010, subject to any applicable
grace periods, the Company and each of its officers and directors have been in
compliance with (i) the applicable listing and other rules and regulations of
The Nasdaq Global Select Market and (ii) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Company Balance

the date of the Company Balance Sheet and except for (a) liabilities incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business after the date of the Company Balance
Sheet and (b) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
There are no (i) unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) off-
balance sheet arrangements of any type required to be disclosed pursuant to
Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act (or any
other material off-balance sheet liabilities) that have not been so disclosed
in the Company SEC Reports, nor any obligations to enter into any such
arrangements.

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business and (b) there
has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect. From June 30, 2011 through the
date hereof, there has not occurred any other action or event that would have
required the consent of the Buyer under clauses (a)(i), (a)(iii), (c), (d),
(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (l) or (o) of Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

Taxes that are due, other than any such Taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings, have not been finally determined and

Balance Sheet (other than in the notes thereto). The unpaid Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof

by a material amount the accruals and reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals
and reserves for deferred Taxes) set forth on the Company Balance Sheet
(other than in the notes thereto).

adjustment of, any material Tax has been asserted or assessed by any
Governmental Entity in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their assets or properties, except for deficiencies or adjustments
that have been satisfied by payment in full, settled or withdrawn. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any
jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries did not file a
Tax Return that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed or is
subject to Tax in such jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has (i) waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes
or agreed or requested to extend the period for assessment or collection of
any Taxes, which waiver or extension is still in effect, (ii) requested any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has
not yet been filed, or (iii) executed or filed any power of attorney with any

Subsidiaries for taxable periods or portions thereof beginning on or after the
Closing Date.

 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of

beginning on or after the Closing Date as a result of (i) indebtedness
discharged with respect to which an election has been made under Section
108(i) of the Code, (ii) a prepaid amount received on or before the Closing
Date, (iii) a change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or

intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law).

thereof, and (ii) "Tax Returns" means any and all reports,
returns, declarations, claim for refund or information return or statements

use or value of the assets subject thereto (the items described in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) collectively, "Permitted Liens"),

landlord, tenant, subtenant, or pursuant to any other occupancy arrangement)
any real property or interests in real property (the "Leased Real
Property"). The Company or one of the Subsidiaries has delivered to the Buyer

licenses, concessions or other agreements, written or oral, granting to any
party (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) the right of use or
occupancy of any portion of or interest in the Leased Real Property, other
than any possession or grant that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

3.10 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries own the material Intellectual Property

or create on behalf of any third party the right to terminate, accelerate,
cancel or modify or otherwise result in the loss or impairment of the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights under (i) any license,
sublicense or other agreement relating to any Intellectual Property owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted (the
"Company Intellectual Property") or (ii) any license, sublicense or other
agreement as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use
any third party Intellectual Property that is material to the business of the

with a per license annual cost of less than $10,000 (the "Third Party
Intellectual Property").

(c) Section 3.10(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete

and copyrights that are owned or licensed for use by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and that are material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted, are subsisting and
have not expired or been cancelled and, to the Companys Knowledge, are valid
and enforceable. No action, suit, proceeding or claim is pending, or, to the
Companys Knowledge, is threatened, challenging the validity, enforceability,

Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written charge, complaint, claim,
demand or notice (including cease and desist letters or invitations to take a
patent license) alleging any such infringement, violation
or misappropriation.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to maintain in confidence in accordance with adequate protection procedures
all Intellectual Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is material
to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and that derives

known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its
disclosure or use. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) maintain commercially reasonable
policies and procedures regarding the privacy and security of all medical,
employee and other personally identifiable information in their possession and
control, which policies and procedures are in material compliance with

of Business), or (xi) that prohibits the payment of dividends or
distributions in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prohibits the pledging of the capital stock of the Company or

(b) Each Company Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, any counterparty thereto, and is in full force and effect except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the Companys Knowledge, any other party to any Company Material Contract
is or is alleged to be in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any condition that, upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company Material
Contract, and since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary,
as the case may be, has waived any material right or relinquished any material
benefit under any such Company Material Contract, except for matters that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2010,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received or sent any notice of nor,
to the Companys Knowledge, does there exist any breach, threatened breach or
threat to suspend performance, terminate, materially alter or not renew, or
commence any litigation in respect of, any such Company Material Contract.

 

(c) Except for any conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, losses, penalties or Liens, and for any
consents or waivers not obtained, that would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
material benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a
change in control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in
the imposition of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on the Companys or
any of its Subsidiarys properties, rights or assets under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Company Material Contract.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any

stock unit, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or
benefits or post-retirement compensation or benefits, or involving the terms
or conditions of any employment, consulting or other service relationship
(including compensation, severance, retention, change in control, termination
or other similar payments or benefits) and all unexpired severance agreements,
for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate; (ii) "ERISA"
means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; and
(iii) "ERISA Affiliate" means any entity that is a member of (A) a controlled
group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group
of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of
the Code), or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined under Section
414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any
of which includes or included the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has made available
to the Buyer a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan
(and any amendments thereto), (ii) the most recent annual report (Form 5500)
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), (iii) each trust
agreement, group annuity contract, the most recent summary plan description
and summaries of material modifications, if any, and the most recent
actuarial reports, if any, relating to such Company Employee Plan, (iv) the
most recent IRS determination letter, if applicable, and (v) for the last
three years, all material correspondence with any Governmental
Entity regarding such Company Employee Plan. There are no actions (other than
routine claims for benefits) outstanding relating to or seeking benefits under
any Company Employee Plan that are pending, or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Employee Plan or any fiduciary of any Company Employee Plan. No Company
Employee Plan is subject to the law of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States.

 

(c) Each Company Employee Plan is being administered in all material respects
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms. Each Company Employee
Plan that is or forms a part of a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS
guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A") (i) has at all times been
administered in material compliance with the requirements of Section 409A and
(ii) either (A) has at all times been in a form that materially complies with
the requirements of Section 409A, or (B) has been timely amended under
guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A so that its terms and provisions
materially comply with the requirements of Section 409A; in all cases so that
the additional tax described in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code will not be
assessed against the individuals participating in any such non-qualified
deferred compensation plan with respect to benefits due or
accruing thereunder. The Companys U.S. federal income tax return is not
under examination by the IRS with respect to nonqualified deferred
compensation. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or otherwise obligated under, any Company Employee Plan that provides for any
gross-up of any Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

(d) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the IRS to
the effect that such Company Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and, to the Companys Knowledge,
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification or
exemption.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates has, within the current or preceding six years, (i)
maintained or contributed to or otherwise had any liability with respect to an
Employee Benefit Plan that was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) been obligated to
contribute to or otherwise had any liability with respect to a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

 



19 (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any (i)
agreement with any stockholder, director, executive officer or other employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are
contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement, or the
occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in
each case, whether alone or in combination with any other event(s)), (B)
providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing
severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of employment of
such director, executive officer or employee; or (ii) agreement or plan
binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock option
plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase
plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall be
increased, or the vesting or payment of the benefits of which shall be
accelerated, by the execution or delivery of this Agreement, stockholder
approval of this Agreement, or the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, whether alone or in combination
with any other event(s)) or the value of any of the benefits of which shall be
calculated or adjusted on the basis of the execution or delivery of this
Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement or the occurrence of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in
combination with any other event(s)). None of the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement or the occurrence of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, whether alone
or in combination with any other event(s)), could result in the payment of any
amount that is reasonably likely to, individually or in combination with
any other payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(g) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable Law or pursuant to and consistent with the terms of severance under
individual employment, severance, retention or change in control agreements,
each of which is set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(h) The Buyer specifically acknowledges that the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.6 and 3.15 do not relate to employee benefit
matters and that any employee benefit matters that would otherwise be
addressed by Sections 3.6 and 3.15 are exclusively addressed in this Section
3.14.

3.15 _Compliance With Laws_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are,
and have been since January 1, 2010, in compliance in all material respects
with, not in violation in any material respect of, and have not received any
written notice alleging any material violation with respect to, any state or
federal statutes, laws, common laws, ordinances, codes, rules, orders,
judgments, injunctions, rulings, opinions, writs, decrees, decisions,
determinations, directives, regulations, governmental guidelines or
interpretations having the force of law, permits, licenses, franchises,
regulations, decrees and orders of Governmental Entities (collectively,
"Laws") with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership
or operation of its properties, rights or assets, including Laws promulgated
by any state dental board or other accrediting agency or by any Governmental
Entity under any healthcare reimbursement program, except for failures to
comply or violations that would not prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger. To the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or any entity to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries provides management services has received any written notice
alleging any material violation of law or any demand or request for documents
or testimony from any government agency or government administrative or
program integrity contractor outside the Ordinary Course of Business. To the
Companys Knowledge, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or entity to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provides management services has
material outstanding overpayments or refunds due to governmental programs or
private programs except amounts arising in the Ordinary Course of Business
that are subject to the Companys, its Subsidiaries or such managed entities
regular practices of identifying and resolving such overpayments or refunds
due and there is no pattern or practice of submitting bills or claims to
governmental programs or private programs for services, items or goods not
actually provided to persons qualified under such governmental programs or
private programs to receive such services, items or goods.

 



20 3.16 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all material
permits, licenses and franchises (collectively, "Company Permits") from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as currently being
conducted and all such Company Permits are in full force and effect and no
cancellation or suspension of any Company Permit is pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Company Permits.

 

3.17 _Labor Matters_. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
list as of the date of this Agreement of all employees of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries whose annual rate of base compensation exceeds
$100,000 per year or who is a member of the "national leadership team", along
with the position, the annual rate of base compensation and annual bonus
opportunity, of each such person. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the subject of, or, to the Companys Knowledge, is threatened
to be the subject of, any charge, claim, complaint or proceeding asserting
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor
organization that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened labor strikes, disputes,
walkouts, work stoppages, slow-downs or lockouts involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement or labor union contract and no employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are represented by any labor union or
organization or works council. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to
labor and employment, including but not limited to Laws relating to
discrimination, disability, labor relations, hours of work, payment of wages
and overtime wages, pay equity, immigration, workers compensation, working
conditions, employee scheduling, occupational safety and health, family and
medical leave, employment and reemployment of members of the uniformed
services and employee terminations. No individual who has performed services
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been improperly excluded from
participation in any Company Employee Plan, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect liability, whether actual or
contingent, with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee, with respect to any
employee leased from another employer, or with respect to any
misclassification of an employee as exempt versus non-exempt.

3.18 _Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance policies
with reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a character and in
such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly situated companies in
the same or similar businesses. Except as would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, all such insurance policies (i) are in full force and effect
and no notice of cancellation or modification has been received thereunder and
(ii) will not be affected by, or terminate or lapse by reason of, this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Edgewater Indemnity Company ("Edgewater") maintains loss reserves calculated
in accordance with proper actuarial principles and conducts its insurance
operations in compliance in all material respects with applicable Laws,
including the insurance laws and regulations of the State of Vermont. There
are no material disputes between Edgewater and any fronting carrier.

3.19 _Opinions of Financial Advisors_. The Special Committee has received from
Greenhill and Co., LLC ("Greenhill") and the Company Board has received from
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated ("BofA Merrill Lynch") an
opinion to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock is fair, from
a financial point of view, to such holders. Copies of such written opinions
will promptly be provided to the Buyer, solely for informational purposes,
following receipt thereof by the Company. It is understood and agreed that
Greenhills opinion is for the benefit of the Special Committee, and BofA
Merrill Lynchs opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board, and neither
opinion may be relied on by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary.

 

3.20 _Section 203 of the DGCL_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary set forth in
Section 4.6, the Company Board has taken all actions necessary so that the
restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business
combination" (as defined in Section 203) shall not apply to the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

financial advisor or other firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a
result of any action, agreement or commitment by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Affiliates, to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for those persons or entities
identified on Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the Company. The Company has made
available to the Buyer a complete and accurate copy of all agreements pursuant
to which any person or entity identified on Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Letter is entitled to any fees and expenses in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary represent and warrant to the Company

conducted, and (b) is duly qualified to do business and, where applicable as a
legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties, rights and assets it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except, solely in the case of clause (b), for such
failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer
Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event, circumstance or development,
in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate, is materially adverse
with respect to, or would be reasonably expected to have any material adverse
effect on, the ability of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or timely perform
any of their other respective obligations hereunder.

4.2 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary has all requisite

or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under,
require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change in control under,
require the payment of a penalty under or result in the imposition of any Lien
on the Buyers or the Transitory Subsidiarys assets under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any lease, license, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to

 



22  which the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to
obtaining the Transitory Subsidiary Stockholder Approval and compliance with

respective properties, rights or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 4.2(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses, penalties or
Liens, and for any consents or waivers not obtained, that would not have a

Buyer are listed for trading is required by or with respect to the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or the
consummation by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the pre-merger notification
requirements under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (ii) the filing of

stock or other securities is necessary for the consummation by the Buyer of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.3 _SEC Filings; Information Provided_.

(a) Neither the Buyer nor any subsidiary or parent of the Buyer (other than
portfolio companies of the Buyer or parent of the Buyer not participating in
the Merger) is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

(b) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement or in any Schedule 13E-3 shall not, on the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time of
the Company Meeting, or, in the case of any Schedule 13E-3, on the date it is
filed with the SEC, contain any statement that, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made therein not false or misleading, or,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, omit to state any material fact necessary
to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting that has become false or
misleading.

4.4 _Absence of Litigation and Certain Changes or Events_. As of the date
hereof, there is no action pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyer,
threatened against the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets except as would not have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary is subject to
any order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree, except as would not have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

4.5 _Operations of the Transitory Subsidiary_. The Transitory Subsidiary was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Financing), has engaged in no other business
activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.6  _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither the Buyer nor the
Transitory Subsidiary, nor, to the Buyers knowledge, any of the Buyers
"affiliates" or "associates", is an "interested stockholder" of
the outstanding Company Common Stock, as such terms are defined in Section
203 of the DGCL.

 



23 4.7 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Buyer has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i)
a fully executed commitment letter from the financial institutions named
therein (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which such financial
institutions (the "Financing Sources") have committed, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt financing
described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) a fully executed commitment letter from JLL Partners Fund
VI, L.P. (the "Investor") (such letter, the "Equity Commitment Letter"),
pursuant to which the Investor has committed, upon the terms and subject only
to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the equity financing described
therein in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter and any other debt commitment letter
executed pursuant to Section 5.4 are hereinafter referred to together as the
"Debt Commitment Letters;" and the Debt Commitment Letters and the Equity
Commitment Letter are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Commitment
Letters." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters
is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt Financing" and the financing
contemplated pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter is hereinafter referred
to as the "Equity Financing." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letter, respectively, is
hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Financing."

(b) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect
and are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary,
the other parties thereto (and the Company has been designated as a third
party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter as provided therein) and
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary, the other parties thereto (subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception); all commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have
been paid in full or will be duly paid in full as and when due and the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary have otherwise satisfied all of the other terms
and conditions required to be satisfied by them pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof; the Commitment Letters have
not been amended, modified or terminated on or prior to the date hereof and
no such amendment, modification or termination is contemplated as of the date
hereof; and as of the date hereof, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
thereunder. The consummation of the Financing is subject to no conditions
other than those expressly set forth in the copies of the Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company. Except (i) for a fee letter relating to fees with
respect to the Debt Financing (a redacted copy of which, removing fee
provisions and market flex provisions and amounts and any other
thresholds, caps or other items not affecting conditionality, has been
provided to the Company) and (ii) for a sponsor letter relating to payment of
certain expenses with respect to the Debt Financing (a copy of which has been
provided to the Company), there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the Financing, other than
as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, subject to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III,
neither the Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing applicable to it will not be
satisfied or the Financing will not be consummated as contemplated in the
Commitment Letters. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing, assuming funding
thereof, together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company as of
the Effective Time, will be sufficient to enable the Buyer to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by it, the Surviving Corporation and the
Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration and
all payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and performance by
the Company of its obligations under Sections 5.1 and 5.4.

(c) Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Article III, neither the Buyer nor the Transitory
Subsidiary is, as of the date hereof, aware of any fact, occurrence or

 



24  condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in any
Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect or that would cause the
commitments provided in any Commitment Letter to be terminated or
ineffective.

(d) The equity investment by the Investor under the Equity Commitment Letter
is not subject to any condition other than the conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter.

(e) Neither the Buyer nor the Investor has any agreement with any Financing
Source to provide any debt financing to the Buyer on an exclusive basis or
that would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent such Financing Source
from providing financing in connection with an Acquisition Proposal made
during the Non-Exclusivity Period in accordance with Section 6.1.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that (i) the Buyers
or the Transitory Subsidiarys obtaining any financing is not a condition to
the obligations of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary to effect the
Merger and (ii) the existence or satisfaction of any conditions contained in
the Commitment Letters shall not constitute, nor be construed to constitute, a
condition to such obligations.

 

4.8 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the payment of all amounts to be paid on the
Closing Date (including the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration
and fees and expenses required to be paid hereunder) and the repayment or
refinancing of any indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement or the
Commitment Letters, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Article III (without giving effect to any
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or any
Knowledge qualifications) (c) the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Buyers obligation to consummate the Merger or the waiver of such conditions
and (d) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that have been provided to the Buyer have been prepared in good
faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, the
Surviving Corporation shall, as of the Effective Time and immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, be able to pay its
debts as they become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value
greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities). Immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
closing of the Financing, the Surviving Corporation shall not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of its business in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged at such time. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of any
financing to be obtained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in order to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation.

4.9  _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Buyer has delivered to the Company the duly executed guarantee of the Investor
(the "Guarantee"). The Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect (except
to the extent the Guarantee has terminated after the date hereof in
accordance with its terms), and as of the date hereof, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of any Investor under the Guarantee.

4.10 _Agreements with Company Stockholders, Directors, Officers and
Employees_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Buyer nor the
Transitory Subsidiary is a party to any contract or agreement (whether or not
binding) with any holder of the Companys capital stock or any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that in any way
relates to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.11 _No Other Information_. Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
acknowledges and agrees that the Company makes no representations or
warranties as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly set forth in
Article III of this Agreement. The representations and warranties set forth
in Article III of this Agreement are made solely by the Company, and no
Representative of the Company shall have any responsibility or liability
related or with respect thereto, except in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 



25 4.12 _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Each of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an
opportunity to discuss the business and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with the management of the Company, (b) has had reasonable access
to (i) the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the
electronic dataroom maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) has been afforded the opportunity to ask
questions of and receive answers from officers of the Company and (d) has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or other statement
by any person on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than
the representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in
Article III of this Agreement and that all other representations
and warranties are specifically disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary further acknowledges and
agrees that, except as set forth in Article III, none of the Company or any of
its stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors,
agents or other Representatives has made any representation or warranty
concerning any estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans or other
forward-looking information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses and operations. Each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to develop such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans
and other forward-looking information with which the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary are familiar, that the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and
other forward-looking information furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information), and that

Investor and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement,
dated as of September 18, 2011, as amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the other applicable provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company hereby releases the Buyer and
its Affiliates from their respective obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement not to provide confidential information to or enter into
discussions, agreements, arrangements or understandings with potential sources
of 

 



28  equity who are limited partners of the active investment funds of the
Investor or prospective limited partners in such investment funds or, subject
to Section 5.4(f), potential sources of debt financing with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.3 _Equity Financing Commitment_.

(a) The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary acknowledge that they shall be
fully responsible for obtaining the Equity Financing and each shall use
reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or
cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Equity Financing, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) complying with all covenants and agreements of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, (iii)
satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter that are
within their control (other than the consummation of the Debt Financing, it
being understood that the obligations of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary with respect to the consummation of the Debt Financing are set
forth in Section 5.4), (iv) consummating the Equity Financing contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter (subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein) at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the Outside
Date), and (v) enforcing the obligations of the Investor and its respective
investment Affiliates (and the rights of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary) under the Equity Commitment Letter. In no event shall the Buyer
or Transitory Subsidiary be required to seek or obtain equity financing other
than the Equity Financing and in no event shall the Investor be required to
provide Equity Financing in an amount in excess of the amount set forth in
its Equity Commitment Letter.

(b) Neither the Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary shall amend, alter or
waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or
inaction) any term of the Equity Commitment Letter without the prior written
consent of the Company, if such amendment, alteration or waiver would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing below the amount to be
provided as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter unless the Debt
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions,
to the receipt of the Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (A) prevent, delay or impair the Closing, (B) make the funding of
the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Equity Financing) less likely to occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, the ability of the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary agrees to notify the Company
promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time prior
to the Closing Date (i) the Equity Commitment Letter expires or is terminated
for any reason (or if any person attempts or purports to terminate the Equity
Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination is
valid), (ii) any Investor refuses to provide the full Equity Financing on the
terms set forth in its Equity Commitment Letter or (iii) the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary believe that they will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter.

5.4 _Debt Financing Commitments_.

(a) The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary acknowledge that they shall be
fully responsible for obtaining the Debt Financing and each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letters, if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent, materially delay
or impair the Closing, (B) make the funding of the Debt Financing 

 



29  (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less
likely to occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters, the ability of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; for the avoidance of
doubt, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary may replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letters or Debt Financing Documents to add commercial banks,
investment banks or other institutional investors as lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities with
commitments thereunder and increase the amount of such commitments in an
amount equivalent to the purchase price in connection with any acquisition
permitted hereby and undertaken in compliance herewith; provided, further,
that the Companys consent to any amendment to the Debt Commitment Letters
that reduces the aggregate amount of Debt Financing available under such Debt
Commitment Letters shall not be unreasonably withheld if, concurrently
therewith, the Company shall enter into additional commitment letters
providing for debt financing in the amount of such proposed reduction.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect
each Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate Debt Financing Documents that
contain terms and conditions set forth in such Debt Commitment Letter (or
terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary, taken as a whole, (including with respect to
the conditionality thereof) than the terms and conditions in such Debt
Commitment Letter), (2) comply with all covenants and agreements of the Buyer
or the Transitory Subsidiary set forth in each Debt Commitment Letter that are
within its control, (3) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary set forth in each Debt Commitment
Letter (including by consummating the financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter upon terms and conditions pursuant thereto) that are within
their control and (4) in the event that all of the conditions to the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied (other than the availability of funding
of any of the financing contemplated under the Equity Commitment Letter)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (and in any event on
or prior to the Outside Date). In the event that all conditions precedent in a
Debt Commitment Letter (other than the availability of funding of any of the
financing contemplated under the Equity Commitment Letter) have been satisfied
or, upon funding will be satisfied, each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders party to
the Debt Commitment Letters to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise enforce its rights under such Debt Commitment Letter. To the extent
not done on or prior to the date hereof, the Buyer will furnish correct and
complete copies of each Debt Commitment Letter to the Company promptly upon
its execution.

(c) The Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed upon request with
respect to the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing and
shall give the Company prompt notice if it becomes aware that the Debt
Financing has become unavailable. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary agrees to notify the Company promptly, and
in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time prior to the Closing
Date (i) a Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or
if any person attempts or purports to terminate a Debt Commitment Letter,
whether or not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii)
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary has actual knowledge of any breach or
default by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary receives any written notice or other written
communication from any person with respect to any breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or (iv)
a Financing Source refuses in writing to provide, expresses an intent in
writing to refuse to provide, or expresses in writing any material concern or
reservation regarding its obligation and/or ability to provide, all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by a Debt Commitment Letter on the
terms set forth therein.

 

(d) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Commitment Letter, each of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts (i)
to arrange to promptly obtain such Debt Financing from alternative sources in
an amount that is sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that
is available and together with any cash

 



30  or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Time, to pay in
cash all amounts required to be paid by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and the Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, the Option
Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain a new debt
financing commitment letter and a new definitive agreement with respect
thereto that provides for debt financing on terms (including structure,
covenants and pricing) not less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary taken as a whole and in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available
together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the
Effective Time, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation and the Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses
related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) The Company agrees, at the Buyers sole cost and expense, to use its
reasonable best efforts to provide (and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to
provide) the Buyer with such cooperation in connection with the financing of
the Merger (including the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters) as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer and as customary in
connection with the arrangement of financing similar in all material respects
to the Financing, provided that (i) no liability or obligation (including any
liability or obligation to pay any commitment or other similar fee) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under
any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the
Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Effective Time) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Subject in all cases to the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, such cooperation shall include the following: (A) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders
and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing; (B)
delivery to the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and their Financing Sources
of the Financing Information as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Buyers request; (C) participation by senior management of the Company in
the negotiation of, and (subject to clause (i) of the preceding sentence) the
execution and delivery of Debt Financing Documents; (D) using its reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Buyer,
the Transitory Subsidiary or their Financing Sources to facilitate the
satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions precedent contained in
paragraphs 8, 10, 11 and 12 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letters; and
(E) using reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters,
lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at
Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all Indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters to be
paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date (the "Existing Company
Debt"). The Company will provide to the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and
their Financing Sources such information as may be necessary so that the
Financing Information and Marketing Material are complete and correct in all
material respects and do not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading. The Company hereby consents to
the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section
5.4(e) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreements; provided that the Company agrees that the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary may share non-public or otherwise confidential information with the
Financing Sources, and that the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and such
Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing Sources
in connection with the

 



31  marketing of the Debt Financing if the recipients of such information agree
to customary confidentiality arrangements. The Buyer shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.4(e). The Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company approved by the Company for use therein).

 

(f) Neither the Buyer nor the Investor shall engage any Financing Source on an
exclusive basis or otherwise on terms that would reasonably be expected to
prevent such Financing Source from providing financing in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal made during the Non-Exclusivity Period in accordance with
Section 6.1.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

requested by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or their Financing Sources.

(ii) "Financing Information" means all information with respect to business,
operations, financial condition, projections and prospects of the Company as

Debt Commitment Letters.

(iii) "Marketing Material" means "public side" and "private side" bank books,
information memoranda, ratings agency presentations and other information
packages and presentations regarding the business, operations, financial
condition, projections and prospects of the Company customarily provided by a
borrower in a secured financing transaction.

(iv) "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of twenty (20)
consecutive Business Days throughout which (x) the Buyer shall have been in
possession of all of the Financing Information and (y) the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied, assuming that
the Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time during such twenty (20)
consecutive Business Day period; provided, that such consecutive twenty (20)
Business Day period shall end on or prior to December 17, 2011 or, if

contained in the Financing Information or (y) the financial statements
included in the Financing Information that is available to the Buyer on the
first day of any such twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period would be
required to be updated under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to be

Day period to permit a registration statement using such financial statements
to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such twenty (20)
consecutive Business Day period, in which case the Marketing Period shall not
be deemed to commence until the receipt by the Buyer of updated Financing
Information that would be required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit
a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new twenty (20)
consecutive Business Day period; and provided further that the Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which the Debt
Financing is obtained.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder.

No later than the third Business Day after the commencement of the Exclusivity
Period, the Company shall notify the Buyer of the number and identity of the
Excluded Parties and provide the Buyer with a written summary of the material
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal made by such Excluded Parties
and, if applicable, copies of all documents relating thereto received prior
to such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may continue to take any of the actions described in
clauses (i) and (ii) above during the Exclusivity Period with respect to any
Excluded Party. Subject to Section 6.1(c) and except as may relate to an
Excluded Party, immediately upon commencement of the Exclusivity Period the
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any persons
conducted theretofore by the Company or any of the Companys Representatives
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request that such person return
or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, during the Exclusivity Period the Company (A) shall not, and shall
not permit any of the Companys Representatives to, provide any non-public
information to any Excluded Party without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) will promptly provide to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any Excluded Party that was not
previously provided or made available to the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(b), if
at any time during the Exclusivity Period and prior to obtaining the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, (i) the Company has otherwise complied with its
obligations under this Section 6.1 in all material respects and has received a
written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Company Board or the
Special Committee believes in good faith to be bona fide, and (ii) the Company
Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, and (iii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or the Special Committee
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person making such Acquisition Proposal and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company (A) will not, and will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose
any non-public information to such person without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) will promptly provide to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other person that was not
previously provided or made available to the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary and (C) in the event it receives such Acquisition Proposal, will
promptly, and in any case within 48 hours after receipt thereof, notify the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary of such Acquisition Proposal, including
the material terms and

 



34  conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal, and
provide copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements, and shall keep the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
reasonably informed as to the status and any material developments concerning
the same. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1(c) shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board or the Special Committee from (x) taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (y) making any other disclosure with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal required by applicable Law; provided, however, with
respect to clause (x) that any such disclosure that is not a recommendation of
rejection of such offer or a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and does not publicly reaffirm the recommendation of the Company
Board or the Special Committee of the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.1(d), prior to obtaining
the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board shall not, directly
or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary), the recommendation
by the Company Board with respect to the Company Voting Proposal or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, or otherwise declare advisable any alternative Acquisition Proposal
or publicly propose to do the foregoing (any such action described in clause
(A) or (B) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or relating to
any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
and, to the extent an Acquisition Proposal involves the issuance of
securities to stockholders of the Company, other than an appropriate
confidentiality agreement that allows the Company to receive and review
confidential information with respect to a proposed issuer of any such
securities) (a "Company Acquisition Agreement"); provided that the Company
shall not be prohibited (whether before or after the commencement of the
Exclusivity Period) from terminating this Agreement and entering into
a Permitted Alternative Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(f), subject
to compliance with this Section 6.1 and Section 8.1(f). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Stockholder
Vote, if there occurs a change in circumstances affecting the Company and its
Subsidiaries that does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) it determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that, in light of such change in circumstances, failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, (ii) the Company Board notifies the Buyer in writing of its
intention to make such Adverse Recommendation Change at least five Business
Days prior to doing so, which notice shall contain a reasonably detailed
description of the change in circumstances, (iii) for the five Business Days
following delivery of the notice described in clause (ii), the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Buyer (to the
extent the Buyer desires to negotiate) in good faith to make such adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Guarantee so
that such failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would not
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and
(iv) following such five Business Day period described in clause (ii), the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Guarantee proposed in writing by the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary in response to the notice described in
clause (ii), that failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. 

 



35 (e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that
contains customary terms and conditions with respect to transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement not materially less restrictive than the
Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making of an Acquisition Proposal); 

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer for,
in one transaction or a series of related transactions, a merger,
reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, dissolution, recapitalization,
share exchange or other business combination or similar transaction involving
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than (1) mergers, consolidations,
tender offers, recapitalizations, share exchanges or other business
combinations involving solely the Company and/or one or more Subsidiaries of
the Company and (2) mergers, consolidations, tender
offers, recapitalizations, share exchanges or other business combinations or
similar transactions that if consummated would result in the holders of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such
transaction owning more than 80% of the equity securities of the Company, or
any successor or acquiring entity, immediately thereafter), (ii) any proposal
for the issuance by the Company of over 20% of its equity securities or (iii)
any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over
20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

"Excluded Party" means any person or group of related persons from whom the
Company has received, during the Non-Exclusivity Period, a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith prior to
the commencement of the Exclusivity Period, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside counsel, is bona fide and
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party
to acquire more than 50% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a
merger, a consolidation or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms which the
Company Board or Special Committee determines in its good faith judgment to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (after having
complied with and taken into account all of the adjustments that have been
offered by the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary pursuant to Section
8.1(f)) and (ii) that the Company Board or Special Committee has determined to
be reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account all financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal and the person making the proposal,
and taking into account the likelihood and timing of consummation as compared
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.2 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date
hereof), the Company, in cooperation with the Buyer, shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond to any comments of
the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time
after the resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify the Buyer
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall supply the Buyer with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or
its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. The Company (x) shall provide the Buyer with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to
filing with the SEC and any responses to comments or inquiries by the SEC with
respect to any filings of the Proxy Statement, (y) shall consider in good
faith including in the Proxy Statement and such responses all comments
reasonably proposed by the Buyer in respect of the

 



36  filings and (z) shall provide the Buyer and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any material discussions or meetings with the
SEC or its staff with respect to such filings to the extent permitted by the
SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all documents
that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities
under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

 

6.3 _NASDAQ Quotation_. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to continue the quotation of the Company Common Stock on The NASDAQ Global
Select Market during the Pre-Closing Period. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with the Buyer and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of The NASDAQ Stock Market to cause the
delisting of the Company Common Stock from The NASDAQ Global Select Market and
the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

6.4 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyers officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives, including financing
sources, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business
hours and in a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with business
operations, to all of its properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel
and records as the Buyer shall reasonably request, provided, however, that
the Company shall not be required to, nor shall the Company be required to
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford access, or disclose any information, (a)
except as otherwise provided by Section 6.1, in connection with or related to
an Acquisition Proposal or (b) that in the good faith judgment of the Company
(after consultation with, and upon the advice of, outside counsel, and after
providing to the Buyer notice of such judgment and the facts and
circumstances of such

judgment (including a general description of the subject matter of such
information)) would (i) violate any obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality, (ii) jeopardize protections
afforded the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the attorney-client
privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, or (iii) violate any
applicable Law. The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Any information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws and the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market to promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable
the Company Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company
Voting Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be required to call, give notice of or convene the
Company Meeting or mail the Proxy Statement, in each case prior to the
commencement of the Exclusivity Period; provided that the Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the
record date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the later of (i) the date on which the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement and
(ii) the commencement of the Exclusivity Period. Subject to the occurrence of
an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.1, (a) the Company
Board shall recommend adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the
stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (b) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject
to the occurrence of an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.1,
the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal
and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the

 



37  vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by the rules of
The NASDAQ Stock Market or the DGCL to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Meeting to provide any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders in advance of the Company
Meeting (solely in the event that such supplement or amendment is determined
by the Company Board in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
to be required to comply with its fiduciary duty of disclosure to the
Companys stockholders or applicable securities Laws and then, only for so
long as the Company Board determines in good faith, after having taken into
account the advice of outside counsel, that such action is necessary to give
the Companys stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosures that the Company has sent to stockholders or otherwise made
available by issuing a press release or filing materials with the SEC), or if
as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting in favor to
approve the Company Voting Proposal or to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Meeting but only until a Company Meeting
may be held at which there are a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain a quorum or the
Company Required Vote (and in no event more than the earlier of 30 days after
the originally scheduled meeting and the Outside Date).

6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.6(b), the
Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal
or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Law
and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable
Law; and

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
providing copies of all such documents filed to the non-filing partys outside
counsel; provided that materials may be redacted to remove references
concerning valuation of the Company. Each of the Company, the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each
other all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law (including all
information required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
6.6(a) shall limit the parties obligations under the other provisions of
this Section 6.6.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for the Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton

 



38  Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
federal, state or foreign Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for
information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust
Order") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with,
and provide to the other partys outside counsel any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law; provided that materials may be
redacted to remove references concerning valuation of the Company.

(c) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to give (or to cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any
notices to third parties other than Governmental Entities, and use, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consents from third parties other than Governmental
Entities required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required
to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (or that would be required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter if any materiality or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers in the representations and warranties of
the Company were disregarded), or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of
an event that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the Effective Time, it
being understood that neither the Company nor the Buyer shall be required to
make any payments in connection with the fulfillment of its obligations under
this Section 6.6(c).

 

6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or stock market
regulations, the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer. Each of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
parties before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement (including if such
public statement is required by applicable Law or stock market regulations).
The restrictions set forth in this Section 6.7 shall not apply to any
communication made by the Company regarding an Acquisition Proposal or the
withholding, withdrawal or modification of the approval or recommendation by
the Company Board with respect to the Company Voting Proposal which shall be
governed by Section 6.1.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, while a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
provided that such advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery
to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to
repay

 



39  all amounts so advanced if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
such Indemnified Party did not act in good faith or in a manner that such
Indemnified Party believed to be in the best interest of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are currently set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to purchase prior to the
Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided that the one-time premium therefor would not be in excess of
three times the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time which
amount is set forth on Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Annual DandO Premium"). If such prepaid "tail policy" is obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) If the Company shall not obtain a tail policy in accordance with Section
6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to the next sentence,
maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not be in excess of 300% of the Annual DandO Premium (such 300%, the "Maximum
Premium"). If the Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not
in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less
advantageous, in the aggregate, to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance.

 

(e) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.8
that results in a judgment against the Buyer for any amount due hereunder.

 

(f) The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents or
in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by Law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

(g) If the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and

 



40  in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation or the
Buyer, as the case may be, set forth in this Section 6.8.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of the notifying party (or, in the case of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) (with respect
to representations and warranties made by the Company) or Section
7.3(a) (with respect to representations and warranties by the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary) would not be satisfied, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
failure of such party (or, in the case of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary) to perform in all material respects any obligation to be performed
by it under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b)
(with respect to obligations of the Company) or Section 7.3(b) (with respect
to obligations of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary) would not be
satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.9 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

6.11 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall use its
best reasonable efforts to give each employee of the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time ("Continuing Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company
or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any
Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), and (b) determination of benefit
levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or
severance, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but
except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or was
not recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of any
comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, the
Buyer shall use its best reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived,
any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and
out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-
of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs, to the same extent such payments are recognized
under any comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer Employee Plan" means any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) sponsored or
maintained by the Buyer for its employees or the employees of the Surviving
Corporation. This Section 6.11 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, shall confer upon any current or former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Continuing Employee or other third
party, any third party beneficiary rights or remedies (including,
without limitation, any right to employment or continued

 



41  employment for any specified period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under
or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing herein is intended to interfere with
the Buyers right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any
Employee Benefit Plan, including any Company Employee Plan or Buyer Benefit
Plan, or the employment of any Continuing Employee.

6.12 _Company Employee Arrangements_. Prior to the Effective Time, if the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates enters
into any contract or agreement, or makes or enters into any formal or
informal arrangements (whether or not binding), with any officer or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that in any way relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer or
Transitory Subsidiary shall notify the Special Committee thereof.

6.13 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to the Buyer resignations executed by each director of the Company in office
immediately prior to the

Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time
and which resignations shall not have been revoked.

43 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time (with respect to Sections 8.1(b) through 8.1(j), by written
notice by the terminating party to the other party), whether before or,
subject to the terms hereof, after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Company; or

 

(b) by either the Buyer or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by March 31, 2012 (the "Outside Date") (provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur
on or before the Outside Date); or

(c) by either the Buyer or the Company, if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling
or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect
of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
(provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in
such order, decree, ruling or other action); or

(d) by either the Buyer or the Company, if at the Company Meeting at which a
vote on the Company Voting Proposal is taken, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the Required Company Stockholder Vote in favor of the
Company Voting Proposal shall not have been obtained; or

(e) by the Buyer prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required
Company Stockholder Vote, if (i) the Company Board shall have failed to
recommend approval of the Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy Statement or
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change or publicly proposed an
Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) the Company Board shall have approved,
endorsed or recommended to the stockholders of the Company an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger); (iii) the Company is in
material breach of its obligations under Section 6.1; or (iv) a tender offer
or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been commenced (other than by the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer) and the
Company Board recommends that the stockholders of the Company tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within ten Business Days after the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend
against acceptance of such offer, including, for these purposes, by taking no
position with respect to acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by its
stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer, within ten Business Days after such
commencement; or

 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, upon the Company Board resolving to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement; provided, that (i) the Company Board shall not so
resolve unless (A) the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with its obligations under Section 6.1, (B) the Company Board or the Special
Committee shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal to
which such Company Acquisition Agreement relates constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board or the Special Committee to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (C) the Company shall have
first provided the Buyer with written notice that the Company Board is
prepared to effect such resolution, which notice shall include all material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or any amendment or
modification thereof, be accompanied by copies of the proposed Company
Acquisition Agreement and any other material documents with the party making
such Acquisition Proposal, and disclose to the Buyer the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (D) for the

 



44  five Business Days following delivery of the notice described in clause
(i)(C) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate
with the Buyer (to the extent the Buyer desires to negotiate) in good faith
to make such adjustments to the terms of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, (ii)
following such five Business Day period described in clause (i)(D),
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes
to this Agreement proposed in writing by the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary in response to the notice described in clause (i)(C), that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement (a "Permitted Alternative Agreement") with respect to such Superior
Proposal following such resolution of the Company Board, and (iv) the Company
immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination pays
to the Buyer or its designees in immediately available funds any fees
required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.3. The Company shall make a copy of
such executed Permitted Alternative Agreement available to the Buyer (provided
that failure of the Company to comply with this obligation shall not affect
any of the Companys rights under this Section 8.1(f)). Any material amendment
to the financial terms or other material amendment of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (i)(C) and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 8.1(f);
provided that references to five Business Days shall be deemed to be
references to a two Business Day period;

 

(g) by the Buyer, if there has been a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Company or a failure to perform a covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall
not have been cured, or is not capable of being cured, within 20 days
following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach, inaccuracy
or failure to perform from the Buyer (or, if earlier, by the Outside Date); or

 

(h) by the Company, if there has been a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or a
failure to perform a covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
or 7.3(b) not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured, or is not
capable of being cured, within 20 days following receipt by the Buyer of
written notice of such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform from the
Company (or, if earlier, by the Outside Date); or

(i) by the Company, if all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2
have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and the
Company has indicated in writing that the Company is ready and willing to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days following the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.3.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and

of Sections 5.2 (Confidentiality), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination),
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 8.4 (Amendment), Section 8.5
(Extension; Waiver) and Article IX (Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the
indemnification and reimbursement provisions of Section 5.4(e) of this
Agreement, and the liabilities and obligations of the parties pursuant to
such Sections, shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement and (b) such termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party hereto from liability for fraud. Nothing shall limit or
prevent any party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under
Section 9.10 hereof in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1.

 



45 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

within two Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement (it
being understood that in no event shall the Buyer be required to pay the

at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events).

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)(x)
the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Buyer
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall, subject to Section 9.10,
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Investor, the Financing Sources and any
of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, affiliates, employees,
representatives or agents ("Buyer Related Parties") for any loss suffered as
a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral

 



46  representations made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith,
in each case, in any circumstance in which the Company is permitted to
terminate this Agreement and receive the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.3 and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Buyer,
Transitory Subsidiary, the Investor, the financing sources under the Debt
Commitment Letters or any of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity
or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise (except that such parties shall
remain obligated for, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, and the
indemnification, reimbursement and expense obligations of the Buyer contained
in Section 5.4(e)), the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter and (y) in
connection with any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant
or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made
in connection herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which
the Company is permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Buyer
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company agrees that the
maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary shall be
limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee, and in
no event shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such
amount and (ii) if the Buyer has the right to receive a termination fee from
the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, the termination fee shall, subject
to Section 9.10, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer, Transitory
Subsidiary, the Guarantor and their respective Affiliates against the Company,
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers,
members, Affiliates, employees, representatives or agents for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement giving rise to or associated with such termination, and upon payment
of such amounts, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates,
employees, representatives or agents shall have any further liability or
obligations relating to or arising out of any such loss. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with Section 9.10 (to the extent permitted thereby) and the payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and any money damages,
including all or a portion of the Buyer Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2, none of the Company, the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made that by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors
(or the Special Committee, in the case of the Company), may, to the extent
legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed
to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

and solely pursuant to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement; (ii)
against the Investor (and its legal successors and assigns of their
obligations hereunder) under, and solely pursuant to the terms of, the

49  terms of the fifth paragraph thereof; and (iv) against the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary in accordance with and solely pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (the claims described in clauses (i) through (iv)
collectively, the "Retained Claims").

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided, that the
Buyer may assign or transfer the rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate
without the prior written consent of the Company provided that the Commitment
Letters and the Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect; and provided,
further, that each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary may assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to the Financing Parties providing the
Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms thereof to the extent necessary
for the purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning
as collateral in respect of such Debt Commitment Letter, but no such
assignment shall release any assigning party from its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. 

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power described in the immediately
preceding sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. No summary
of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of

 



50  the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of
Delaware.

 

9.10 _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such person, and
the exercise by a person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, including Section 5.4, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing,
the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause the Buyer
and/or the Transitory Subsidiary to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Commitment Letter and to cause the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with Section 1.3, on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, if, but only if, (A) all conditions in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at Closing) have been satisfied, (B) the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing within ten Business Days of the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.3, (C) the Debt
Financing (or if alternative financing is being used in accordance with
Section 5.4, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically the Buyers
and/or the Transitory Subsidiarys obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing).

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an adequate remedy at
Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity.

(d) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or nature (whether in Law or in equity) against a Financing Source (and/or
any of their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
advisors, agents, attorneys or representatives) relating to this Agreement or
the Debt Commitment Letter. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has
no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in
each case with respect to damages of the Company and its Affiliates, any
Financing Source whether by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Buyer
against any Financing Source, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable law, or otherwise. Recourse against the Buyer to the extent
permitted in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Affiliates against the Financing Parties in respect of any
liabilities arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or
proceeding between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) subject to the
last sentence of this Section 9.11, agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding 

 



51  shall be heard and determined only in any such court, (c) agrees that it
shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding against a party arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees
that any claim, controversy or dispute arising in connection with any Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, and agrees that the Financing Parties are beneficiaries of any
liability cap or limitation on damages or remedies in this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other person with respect thereto. Any
party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section
9.11, however, shall affect the right of any person to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or permit any of their Affiliates
to bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Parties in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter, in any forum other than any New York State
court or federal court sitting in the City of New York in the Borough of
Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

 

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER; (C) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

9.13 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in Sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in this
Agreement. The disclosure in any Section, whether related to representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements, shall qualify the corresponding Section
of this Agreement. The disclosure in any Section of this Agreement in Article
III or Article IV shall qualify each other Section in Article III or Article
IV to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

9.14 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of
the individuals identified in Section 9.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law,
subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of

adopted by the board of directors may be amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by
written ballot.

SIXTH: (a) No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director
notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability; provided,
however, that, to the extent provided by applicable law, this provision shall
not eliminate the liability of a director i) for any breach of a directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation
Law of Delaware, or iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director
occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

 

(b) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or testifies in,
any threatened, pending or completed action, claim, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee
benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, against all claims, losses,
liabilities, expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements), damages,
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to
the fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, and the Corporation may adopt bylaws or enter into agreements
with any such person for the purpose of providing for such indemnification.

(c) To the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article SIXTH, or in defense
of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith.

 



54 (d) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in
defending or testifying in a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, claim, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or
was an officer or director of the Corporation (or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust
or other enterprise) shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, claim, suit or proceeding within ten business
days of the Corporations receipt of a request for advancement of such
expenses from such director or officer and, to the extent required by law,
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any such director or officer
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation against such
expenses as authorized by the relevant sections of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, and the Corporation may adopt bylaws or enter into
agreements with such persons for the purpose of providing for such advances.

(e) The indemnification permitted by this Article SIXTH shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding an office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

(f) The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against
such liability under the provisions of this Article SIXTH or otherwise.
