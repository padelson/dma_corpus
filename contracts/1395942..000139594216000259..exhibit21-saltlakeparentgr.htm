Financial Statements were prepared in a manner consistent with past practice,
and fairly and accurately present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows and changes in equityholders'
equity as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
covered thereby. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7, the Year-End Financial
Statements contain and reflect adequate provisions for all reasonably

Sheet has been disposed of only in the ordinary course of business.

(c) All of the Accounts Receivable reflected in the Most Recent Year-End
Balance Sheet, and all Accounts Receivable arising subsequent to the date
thereof, have arisen out of bona fide sales and deliveries of goods,
performance of services and other business transactions in the ordinary course
of business as to which full performance has been rendered by the applicable
Seller.

(d) The Seller, to its Knowledge, maintain accurate books and records
reflecting their assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate
internal accounting controls that provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions are executed with management's authorization; (ii) transactions

statements of the Seller and to maintain accountability for the Seller's
consolidated assets; (iii) access to the Seller's assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's authorization; (iv) adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection of accounts, notes and other receivables
on a timely basis, and (v) there are adequate procedures in place regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Seller's assets.

or at the Closing, be terminated:

(a) by either the Buyer or the Selling Parties if a material Breach of any
provision of this Agreement has been committed by any other Party and such
Breach has not been waived;

(b) by the Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 6.1 has not been
satisfied as of the Outside Date or if satisfaction of such a condition is or
becomes impossible (other than through the failure of the Buyer to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement) and the Buyer has not waived such
condition on or before the Outside Date;

(c) by the Selling Parties, if any of the conditions in Section 6.2 has not
been satisfied as of the Outside Date or if satisfaction of such a condition
is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of any Selling Party
to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and the Selling Parties
have not waived such condition on or before the Outside Date;

(d) by the Buyer, if the FTC, Antitrust Division or any other Governmental
Authority requires the submission of additional information or documentary
material (second request), pursuant to the provisions of the HSR Act
(including 18 U.S.C. §18A(e)) or any other applicable Antitrust Laws;

(e) by the Selling Parties, if (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.2 (other than those that require deliveries or are tested at the time of
Closing, which conditions could be satisfied if the Closing had occurred at
the time of such termination) are satisfied or waived on the date that the
Closing should have been consummated in accordance with Article VIII, (ii) the
Selling Parties have irrevocably certified in writing that they are ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing, and (iii) the Buyer fails to

following receipt of written notice from the Selling Parties as to the
satisfaction of such conditions and the Selling Parties' willingness to
consummate the Closing; or

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. Each Party's right of termination under
Section 7.1 is in addition to any other rights it, he or she may have under
this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will
not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, all further obligations of the Parties will terminate, except
that the obligations in Sections 7.3, 11.6, 11.9 and 11.14 will survive.

Section 7.3 Break-Up Fee. If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or the Selling Parties pursuant to Section 7.1(e), within five
(5) Business Days after the date of such termination, the Buyer shall pay the
Selling Parties a fee in the amount of Four Million Eight Hundred Thirty Six
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($4,836,000.00) ("Break-Up Fee"), which payment

Parties would likely sustain by way of such termination, and that damages to
the Selling Parties would be difficult to ascertain. In the event the Buyer is

pays the Break-up Fee, payment of such fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Selling Parties against the Buyer and its Affiliates for any Losses suffered
or incurred as a result of, or in connection with, the failure of the Closing
to occur (and such payment of the Break-Up Fee shall constitute liquidated
damages, and not a penalty), and in such case, following the termination of
this Agreement none of the Buyer or its Affiliates shall have any Liability
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby other than Buyer's obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee when due pursuant
to this Section 7.3; provided further that in the event an action is commenced
by either the Selling Parties against the Buyer, or the Buyer against the
Selling Parties, in connection with payment or collection of the Break-up Fee,
the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover attorneys'
fees, expenses, and court costs incurred in connection therewith.

(m) any (i) Taxes (A) imposed on the Seller (which for purposes of this
Section 9.1(m) shall include the Shareholders with respect to their respective

otherwise known by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No disclosure to the
Buyer or its representatives, or investigation made by or on behalf of the
Buyer, including, but not limited to, any knowledge obtained by the Buyer or
any of its agents or representatives as a result of such investigation,
whether such disclosure or investigation is prior to or following the date of
this Agreement, shall modify or limit the scope of the representations and
warranties of the Selling Parties in this Agreement or limit Liability of the
Selling Parties for (including any indemnification obligation pursuant to this
Article IX with respect to) any breach thereof.

Section 9.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. From and after the Closing, the
Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and save the Selling Parties and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents and affiliates (each, a
"Seller Indemnified Party") forever harmless from and against any and all
Losses sustained or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party relating to,
resulting from, arising out of, or otherwise by virtue of: (a) any
misrepresentation in or breach of the representations and warranties of the
Buyer contained in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or in any
Schedule or Exhibit hereto or thereto; (b) the failure of the Buyer to perform
any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement or the other

Indemnified Party of any Liability for the Buyer's failure to pay the Assumed

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedure. If a Buyer Indemnified Party or a
Seller Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Article IX, such
party (the "Indemnified Party") shall give reasonably prompt written notice to
the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") of the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the claim. If any suit, action, claim or Liability shall be
brought or asserted by any third party which, if adversely determined, would
entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnifying Party may, if it so elects by written notice to the Indemnified
Party given within fifteen (15) days of the Indemnifying





Party's receipt of the notice of commencement thereof (which written notice
shall include an acknowledgement that such claim is one for which the
Indemnifying Party is responsible under this Article IX), assume and control
the defense thereof (and shall consult with the Indemnified Party with respect
thereto), including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the payment of all necessary expenses; provided that,
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of such
defense if the claim as to which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume
control involves or relates to: (a) a claim for non-monetary relief; (b)
criminal or quasi-criminal allegations; (c) a claim asserted by or on behalf
of a customer, supplier or borrower of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
and the loss of the commercial relationship with such customer, supplier or
borrower, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, would be
materially adverse to the Indemnified Party; or (d) a proceeding in which the
Indemnifying Party is also a named party and the interests of the Indemnifying
Party would reasonably be expected to conflict with the interests of the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party has the right to
retain exclusive control of the defense of such claim due to a failure of the
Indemnifying Party to satisfy any of the requirements set forth above, the
Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts, consistent with prudent
business judgment, to defend such claim. If the Indemnifying Party is
permitted to assume and control the defense and elects to do so, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and to participate in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i)
the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying
Party in writing; (ii) the Indemnifying Party has been advised by counsel that
a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel; in which case the fees
and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made by
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in this Section
9.3 shall not be binding upon the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
as the case may be, without its prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.4 Failure to Give Timely Notice. A failure by an Indemnified Party
to give timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in Section 9.3 will
not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, any party entitled to receive
such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under its
applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise directly and materially damaged
as a result of such failure to give timely notice.

Section 9.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Except as provided in Section 9.5(f) and Section 9.5(g), the Selling
Parties indemnification obligations to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
Section 9.1 will not commence unless and until the Losses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Party as a result thereof equals or exceeds in the aggregate

obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for all Losses incurred

indemnification obligations to the Seller Indemnified Parties under Section

Basket Amount, at which time the Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties for all Losses incurred by all Seller Indemnified
Parties from the first dollar of such Losses.

(c) Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), Section 9.5(f) and Section 9.5(g),
the aggregate amount of Losses for which any of the Selling Parties shall be
liable for breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to Section
9.1(a) shall not exceed $7,979,400.00 (the "General Cap Amount").

(d) Except as provided in Section 9.5(f) and Section 9.5(g), the aggregate
amount of Losses for which any of the Selling Parties shall be liable for
breaches of Fundamental Representations, Special Representations and pursuant
to any clause of Section 9.1 other than Section 9.1(a) shall not exceed
$22,165,000.00 (the "Special Cap Amount").

(e) Except as provided in Section 9.5(f) and Section 9.5(g), the aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Buyer shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.2
shall not exceed an amount equal to the General Cap Amount.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 9.5(a),
Section 9.5(b), Section 9.5(c), Section 9.5(d) and Section 9.5(e) shall not
apply to Losses in connection with, incident to, resulting from or arising out
of, directly or indirectly, Taxes, any intentional misrepresentation, fraud or
criminal activity and such Losses shall not be subject to the Basket Amount
and shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether the General Cap
Amount or Special Cap Amount has been met or exceeded.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 9.5(a)
shall not apply to Losses in connection with, incident to, resulting from or
arising out of, directly or indirectly, Floorplan Loan Liabilities, Compliance
Liabilities, Employee Liabilities and such Losses shall not be subject to the
Basket Amount.

Section 9.6 Survival. The representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for eighteen months (18) months after the
Closing Date, except that claims based upon or arising out of:

(a) Special Representations, and any claim for indemnification relating to
Taxes pursuant to Section 9.1(m) shall survive the Closing for ninety (90)
days after the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations, including
any extensions thereof; and

(b) Fundamental Representations shall survive indefinitely.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party delivers written notice
to an Indemnifying Party of an indemnification claim relating to a particular
representation or warranty on or before the close of business on the date on
which such representation or warranty expires as set forth above,





any such claim, and the representations and warranties on which such claim is
based, shall survive until such claim is resolved or judicially determined.

Section 9.7 Payments; Right of Set-Off.

(a) Payments.

(i) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the resolution of any
indemnification claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder pursuant to
which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to any payment, (A) if there
are funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Seller's
Representative and the Buyer shall execute and cause a joint written direction
(a "Joint Direction") to be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, which Joint Direction shall direct the Escrow
Agent to make such payment out of the Indemnity Escrow Account, and (B) if the
Indemnity Escrow Account contains insufficient funds to satisfy in full any
claim or portion thereof to be paid to any Buyer Indemnified Party, such
payment shall be made by the Selling Parties.

(ii) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the resolution of any
indemnification claim by any Seller Indemnified Party hereunder pursuant to
which such Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to any payment, such payment
shall be made by the Buyer.

(iii) The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for any and
all reasonable, out-of-pocket costs or expenses of any nature or kind
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, all reasonable attorney's fees)
incurred in seeking to collect any payments under this Section 9.7(a).

(b) Right of Set-Off. In addition to any other rights and remedies of the
Buyer under this Agreement (including this Article IX), the other Transaction
Documents or otherwise arising by Law, to the extent that recourse against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount fails to satisfy an indemnification obligation
pursuant to this Article IX within the time periods prescribed in Section 9.6,
the Buyer may, in its sole discretion, set off the amount of such
indemnification obligation or any portion thereof against any amounts the
Buyer may owe to any Selling Party under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.2, Section 2.7 and this Article IX) or any other
Transaction Document.

Section 9.8 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any indemnification received under
this Article IX shall be, to the extent permitted by Law, an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

Section 9.9 Allocation of Tax Liability for Straddle Periods. In the case of
any taxable period that includes (but does not end) on the Closing Date (each
a "Straddle Period") (a) the amount of any Taxes imposed with respect to the
Business or the Assets based or measured by income or receipts for the portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and (b) the amount of any other Taxes for the Straddle Period for the portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied





by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period.

Section 9.10 Exclusive Remedies. Except as provided in Section 7.3, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with

ARTICLE X 
COVENANTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

Section 10.1 Employees. The Buyer, its assigns, and/or its Affiliates, shall
offer employment to certain employees of the Seller who are in good standing
as of the Closing Date as determined by the Buyer, its assigns and/or its
Affiliates in their sole and absolute discretion. Those employees who accept
such offers of employment shall be referred to herein as the "Transferred
Employees". Such employment shall not create any continuing right to
employment for any such Transferred Employees except as may be set forth by
contract or by applicable law. The Parties agree that the Seller shall be
solely responsible for all Liabilities relating, directly or indirectly, to
any Person who is not a Transferred Employee, including, without limitation,
Liabilities relating to or arising out of compensation, severance matters,
discrimination or retaliation charges or complaints, workers' compensation
claims, and WARN Act. The Seller shall also be responsible, as between the
Buyer, its assigns and/or its Affiliates on the one hand and the Seller on the
other hand, for any employment-related claims, charges, and complaints
including any related Liabilities filed by any current or former employees
(including temporary and leased employees) or independent contractors of the
Seller (whether or not any such individual is hired by the Buyer) which were
(a) filed prior to the Closing Date or (b) filed after the Closing Date but
which arose from facts and circumstances which existed prior to the Closing
Date or as a result of the Contemplated Transaction. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, following the Closing Date nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the Buyer's, its assigns and/or its Affiliates ability
to (i) terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time and
for any reason, including without cause, but such termination shall in no way
cause Liability to the Seller, or (ii) change the terms and conditions of
employment of such Transferred Employees. Nothing herein shall confer upon any
Personnel any rights or remedies hereunder, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period or continued participation in
any Employee Benefit Plan of the Seller or other benefit plan, of any nature
or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The Seller shall be
liable for the provision of notices and COBRA continuation coverage for each
individual who is or becomes an "MandA Qualified Beneficiary" (as such term is
defined in Treas. Reg. Section 54.4980B-9) as a result of the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 10.2 Non-Competition; Confidentiality. The Parties agree that the
Buyer is relying on the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section
10.2, and that the Purchase Price is sufficient consideration to make the
covenants and agreements set forth herein enforceable.

(a) Non-Competition. In furtherance of the transfer of the Assets to the Buyer
hereunder by virtue of the Contemplated Transactions, to more effectively
protect the value of the Assets so transferred, and to induce to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions, each Selling Party covenants and agrees that,
for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Term"), such Selling Party will not, nor
will such Selling Party permit any of its, his or her Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly, (i) individually or as a shareholder, director, officer,
member, partner, joint venturer, employee or agent of any other Person, engage
in the Business (except as an employee or independent contractor of the Buyer
or one of its assigns or Affiliates), or in any business which is competitive
with the Business, or in any Affiliate Business, anywhere within North
America; (ii) solicit any Person who is or was a customer or supplier of the
Seller, or who becomes a customer or supplier of the Buyer, its assigns and/or
its Affiliates at any time during the Term, for the purpose of, directly or
indirectly, engaging in, or assisting any Person in engaging in, any business
which competes, directly or indirectly, with the Business; or (iii) solicit
for employment and/or hire any employee of Seller hired by the Buyer or any
other Person who is on the Closing Date, or becomes at any time during the
Term, an employee of the Buyer, or any such person who was employed by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates at any time during the six (6) months prior to such
solicitation or hiring. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Section 10.2(a) shall prohibit any Selling Party or any of its, his or
her Affiliates from owning not more than an aggregate of two percent (2%) of
any class of stock listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the
over-the-counter market; provided that no Selling Party or its, his or her
Affiliates is actively engaged in the Business or the Buyer's business, (B)
the individuals listed on Exhibit 10.2-B from engaging in the permitted
activities listed on Exhibit 10.2-B, so long as such individuals received
prior written approval from the Buyer and are not an employee of the





Buyer or its Affiliates at the time of such engagement, (C) any Selling Party
or any of its, his or her Affiliates from owning not more than an aggregate of
ten percent (10%) of any equity securities in a Person engaged in the
permitted activities listed on Exhibit 10.2-B, or (D) the individuals listed
on Exhibit 10.2-D from owning equity securities pursuant to the terms and
conditions as set forth on Exhibit 10.2-D.

(b) Confidentiality. Each of the Parties hereto recognize and acknowledge that
(i) as of the Closing, they have knowledge of confidential information
concerning the other, the Business and the Assets ("Confidential Information")
and (ii) in some cases, may continue to have access to Confidential
Information after the Closing through their relationship and affiliation. In
light of the foregoing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information
and not use such Confidential Information, except to the extent disclosure of
any such information is required by Law or expressly authorized by or
reasonably occurs in connection with disputes over the terms of this
Agreement. In the event that any Party reasonably believes after consultation
with counsel that it, he or she is required by Law to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Party will (A) provide the other Parties with
prompt notice before such disclosure in order that such other Parties may
attempt to obtain a protective order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information, and (B) cooperate
with such other Parties in attempting to obtain such order or assurance.

(c) Remedies. Without limiting the right of the Buyer or the Selling Parties
to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to them for
violations of this Section 10.2, it is agreed that other remedies cannot fully
compensate Buyer or the Selling Parties, as the case may be, for such a
violation and that each of them shall be entitled to injunctive relief
(without the necessity of posting a bond) to prevent violation or continuing
violation thereof. It is the intent of and understanding of each Party that
if, in any action before any court legally empowered to enforce this Section
10.2, any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this Section 10.2 is found
to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term,
restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency.

Section 10.3 Consents.

(a) Obtaining Consents. Prior to and after the Closing,

(i) Each Selling Party will as promptly as reasonably practicable take all
commercially reasonable steps necessary to obtain all Consents required of
such Selling Party to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including,
without limitation, any Consents required under any Contracts to which any
Selling Party is a party or by which any of such Selling Party's properties or
assets is bound.

(ii) Each Selling Party shall provide such other information and
communications to any Governmental Authority or other Persons as such
Governmental Authority or other Persons may reasonably request in connection
therewith.





(iii) The Seller's Representative will provide, or cause to be provided,
notification to the Buyer when any such Consent referred to above is obtained,
taken, made or given, as applicable, and will advise the Buyer of any
communications (and, unless precluded by Law, provide copies of any such
communications that are in writing) with any Governmental Authority or other
Person regarding any of the Contemplated Transactions.

(b) Nonassignable Contracts. To the extent that the assignment hereunder by
the Seller to the Buyer of any Contract is not permitted or is not permitted
without the Consent of any other party to the Contract, this Agreement shall
not be deemed to constitute an assignment of any such Contract if such Consent
is not given or if such assignment otherwise would constitute a breach of, or
cause a loss of contractual benefits under, any such Contract, and the Buyer
shall not assume any Liabilities thereunder. With respect to any such
Contract, the Selling Parties shall continue to use their respective
reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents and shall cooperate with the Buyer
in any arrangement designed to provide the Buyer with the rights and benefits
(subject to the obligations) under any such Contracts.

Section 10.4 Payment of Excluded Liabilities. After the Closing, the Selling
Parties, jointly and severally, agree to pay in full and discharge all of the
Excluded Liabilities in accordance with their stated terms, as applicable, and
in a manner that is not materially detrimental to any relationships of the
Business with lessors, employees, customers, suppliers or others. The Selling
Parties will refer to the Buyer all inquiries relating to the Business.

Section 10.5 Delivery of Correspondence. From and after the Closing, each
Selling Party agrees that such Selling Party shall promptly forward to the
Buyer any written correspondence from third parties received by such Selling
Party in connection with the Business, and shall advise the Buyer of any oral
communications with third parties related to the Business. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Selling Party agrees to promptly forward
to the Buyer any letters, notices, or other written communication received by
it regarding the Contracts.

Section 10.6 Transferee/Successor Liability. The Parties agree that the Buyer
will not, by virtue of the Contemplated Transactions, assume any Liabilities
of the Seller other than the Assumed Liabilities and, accordingly, the Selling
Parties will take all reasonable actions to fully protect the Buyer from and
against transferee or successor Liability (other than with respect to the
Assumed Liabilities) arising out of the Contemplated Transactions, including,
without limitation, any and all Liabilities relating to COBRA, Taxes,
Environmental and Safety Requirements and Employee Benefit Plans.

Section 10.7 The Seller's Names. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that all
of its respective rights in and to, and ownership of, the Trade Names shall be
transferred hereunder to the Buyer. From and after the Closing, the Seller
shall be prohibited from using the Trade Names or a name similar to the Trade
Names.

Section 10.8 Access to Information.

assigns) shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the

law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial
by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions.

the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. The Buyer may assign this Agreement and all rights relating thereto,

hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Selling Party may assign any of its, his or her rights or delegate any of its,

without the written consent of the Buyer. The Selling Parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that the Buyer intends to assign its right to purchase the Assets

event of such assignment, the Purchase Price payable by each such assignee
shall be allocated among the Seller in accordance with Schedule 2.6.

Sections of this Agreement are included for purposes of convenience only and
shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any of its provisions.

Section 11.13 Construction. Where specific language is used to clarify by
example a general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not
be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the
general statement to which it relates. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Party.

Section 11.14 Invalid Provisions. Except for Section 10.2, which shall be
governed by Section 10.2(c), if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable;
(b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
by its severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible; provided
however, that except as contemplated in this Agreement, in no such event shall
the Seller enter into a separate agreement with Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
in connection with the sale of the equity or assets of Seller.

Section 11.15 Appointment of Seller's Representative.

(a) The Selling Parties hereby designate Robert J. Brasher, or such other
Person as shall be designated in writing by the Selling Parties (the "Seller's
Representative"), to serve as the representative of the Selling Parties with
respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents to be performed by the Seller's Representative.

(b) Each Selling Party, by the execution of this Agreement, hereby irrevocably
appoints the Seller's Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact
for such Selling Party for all purposes of this Agreement and the documents
associated herewith, including the full power and authority on such Selling
Party's behalf.

(i) to determine the presence (or absence) and directing payment of proceeds
of claims for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Article IX;

(ii) to deliver all notices required to be delivered by such Selling Party
under this Agreement, including a claim for which indemnification is sought
under Article IX;

(iii) to receive all notices required to be delivered to such Selling Party
under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any notice of a claim for
which indemnification is sought under Article IX;

(iv) to take any and all action on behalf of such Selling Party from time to
time as the Seller's Representative may deem necessary or desirable to defend,
pursue, resolve and/or settle disputes or claims under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, claims for indemnification under Article IX;

(v) to consent on behalf of such Selling Party with respect to matters under
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;

(vi) to engage and employ agents and representatives (including accountants,
legal counsel and other professionals) and to incur such other expenses as it
deems necessary or prudent in connection with the administration of the
foregoing; and

(vii) to take any and all action on behalf of such Selling Party to assign to
the Buyer all Assets and to evidence any such assignments, including, without
limitation, execution and, if necessary, filing with the proper Governmental
Authorities documents evidencing such assignments of the Assets.





Each Selling Party agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller's
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Selling Party. All decisions and actions by
the Seller's Representative (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall
be binding upon each Selling Party, and no Selling Party shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) Each Selling Party agrees that the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any
action taken by the Seller's Representative, on behalf of such Selling Party,
pursuant to Section 11.15(b) above (an "Authorized Action"), and that each
Authorized Action shall be binding on each Selling Party as fully as if such
Selling Party had taken such Authorized Action.

(d) Each Selling Party hereby severally, for itself, himself or herself only
and not jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller's Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by the Seller's Representative in connection with any Proceeding to
which the Seller's Representative is made a party by reason of the fact it is
or was acting as the Seller's Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.
