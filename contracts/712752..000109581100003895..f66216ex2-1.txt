Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock and all shares of Company Common Stock owned by any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.   (b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (c) Conversion of Shares. Except as provided in clause (a)
of this Section 3.01, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Shares") shall be converted
into the right to receive such number of fully paid and nonassessable Parent
Ordinary Shares as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Exchange Ratio" shall mean
1.286. At the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a "Certificate") formerly representing any of such Shares shall thereafter
represent only     -9-  14  the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares and
any dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.03(c), in each case,
without interest.   (d) Certain Adjustments. In the event that, subsequent
to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, any change in
the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur
as a result of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend,
recapitalization, redenomination of share capital or other similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio and other items dependent thereon shall be
appropriately adjusted.   (e) Issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares and HoldCo
Promissory Notes. In consideration for the issuance by Parent of the Parent
Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.01(c),
HoldCo shall issue one or more promissory notes to Parent in the form and
amounts to be mutually agreed upon by Parent and HoldCo (the "HoldCo
Promissory Notes"). The amount required to be contributed by HoldCo to pay up
the Parent Ordinary Shares (stortings-plicht) shall be the aggregate nominal
value; any excess contributed shall be accepted by Parent as nonmandatory
share premium (niet-bedongen agio). In consideration for the other steps
referred to in this Section 3.01 (including the issuance of the HoldCo
Promissory Notes by HoldCo), Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
pursuant to Section 3.02, the Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in the
Merger for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock entitled
thereto pursuant to Section 3.01(c) for the purposes of giving effect to the
conversion and exchange referred to in this Article III.   Section 3.02
Exchange of Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purposes of exchanging the Certificates for the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares.
As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five Business Days, after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause to be sent, to each
holder of record of Shares as of the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other
customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation or Parent may
reasonably specify) providing instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares.   Section 3.03 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
(i) for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the aggregate number of Parent
Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01(c) and (ii) an amount
of cash sufficient to permit the Exchange Agent to make the necessary
payments of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance
with Section 3.03(e)(such cash and Parent Ordinary Shares, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"), to be held for the benefit of and distributed to the
Company\'s stockholders in accordance with this Section. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the
Surviving Corporation on a daily basis in reasonably prudent     -10- 
15  investments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the letter of transmittal referred to in
Section 3.02 duly executed and completed in accordance with its terms, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) a certificate or certificates representing the Merger Consideration into
which the Shares represented by such Certificate have been converted
in accordance with Section 3.01(c), (ii) the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective
Time which theretofore became payable with respect to the Parent Ordinary
Shares constituting such Merger Consideration, and (iii) the cash amount
payable in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with
Section 3.03(e), in each case, which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In no event shall the holder of any
Certificate be entitled to receive interest on any funds to be received in
the Merger. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate or
certificates representing the Merger Consideration into which such Shares
have been converted in accordance with Section 3.01(c), plus the cash amount
payable in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with
Section 3.03(e), may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid by the stockholder.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.03(b) and subject to
Section 3.03(c), each Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into
which the number of Shares shown thereon has been converted in
accordance with Section 3.01(c), plus the cash amount payable in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 3.03(e).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates representing Shares surrendered
for exchange by any Person constituting a "Rule 145/Pooling Affiliate" of the
Company for purposes of Section 6.13 shall not be exchanged until Parent has
received the letter required by Section 6.13 from such Rule 145/Pooling
Affiliate.   (c) Distributions With Respect To Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date on
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares represented thereby
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.03(e) until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Section. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
of the certificates representing Parent Ordinary Shares, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time
which theretofore became payable, but which were not paid by reason of the
immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to
such Parent Ordinary Shares.     -11-  16  Dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time, but prior to
surrender of Certificates by holders thereof payable in respect of Parent
Ordinary Shares held by the Exchange Agent, shall be held in trust for the
benefit of such holders of Certificates.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights
In Company Common Stock. All Parent Ordinary Shares issued and all cash paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.03(e) ) shall be deemed
to have been issued at the Effective Time in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares represented thereby. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers thereon of the Shares. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Section.   (e) No Fractional Shares.   (i) No certificate or scrip
representing fractional Parent Ordinary Shares shall be issued in the Merger
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
of Parent will relate to such fractional Parent Ordinary Shares, and such
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights of a holder of Parent Ordinary Shares.   (ii) As promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (a) the number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) over
(b) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Ordinary Shares to be
distributed to former holders of Shares pursuant to Section 3.03(b)(such
excess being herein called the "Excess Shares"). Following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of the former holders of Shares,
sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NASDAQ
Stock Market\'s National Market ("NASDAQ"), all in the manner provided in
Section 3.03(e)(iii).   (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on the NASDAQ in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use reasonable efforts to complete the
sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the
Exchange Agent\'s sole judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the
best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until
the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of Certificates formerly representing Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders (the "Shares Trust"). All
commissions, transfer Taxes and other outofpocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in
connection with such sale of the Excess Shares, shall be paid from the Shares
Trust (the "Expenses"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the
Shares Trust to which each former holder of Shares is entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Shares
Trust (less the aggregate amount of the Expenses) by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such former holder of Shares is entitled (after taking into account
all Shares held at the     -12-  17  Effective Time by such holder)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all former holders of Shares are entitled.   (iv)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.03(e)(ii) and (iii), Parent may
elect at its option, exercised prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the
issuance and sale of Excess Shares and the making of the payments herein
above contemplated, to pay each former holder of Shares an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the average of the last
reported sales prices of Parent Ordinary Shares, as reported on NASDAQ, on
each of the five Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date by (B) the fractional Parent Ordinary
Share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.   (f) Termination
of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the Company\'s stockholders for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to or as directed by Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) as a general creditor for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Ordinary Shares. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any Certificate for Parent
Ordinary Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash
payable in respect of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares, delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any securities or cash amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of Certificates five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented thereby have been converted, any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Ordinary Shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions in respect of
or on Parent Ordinary Shares deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.   (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Parent Ordinary
Shares (and any dividends or distributions thereon) and cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares otherwise payable hereunder to any holder
of Certificates in respect of the Shares formerly represented thereby such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any applicable provision of federal, state or local
income Tax Law. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or Parent so
withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this     -13-  18  Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   Section 3.04
Company Stock Options and Stock Rights.   (a) At the Effective Time and
subject to the terms and conditions of any of the agreements or plans set
forth in Section 3.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and except as set
forth in Section 3.04(b), each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under the Company Stock
Option Plans, whether or not exercisable, shall be assumed or substituted in
a manner consistent with applicable Laws by Parent. Each Company Stock Option
so assumed or substituted in a manner consistent with the applicable Laws by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase
rights), except that (i) each Company Stock Option shall be exercisable (or
shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option shall be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent.   (b) The Company shall take all actions necessary,
including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company\'s 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") (i) to cause the rights of participants in
the ESPP with respect to any offering period underway as of the Effective
Time pursuant to the ESPP to be determined by treating the last Business Day
prior to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and to
prevent any offering period from commencing or occurring after the
termination of such offering period, (ii) to make such other prorata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the reduced offering period but
otherwise treating such offering period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes of the ESPP, and (iii) to cause the ESPP and
all rights of participants therein and any other employees of the Company and
all obligations of the Company thereunder (except for ordinary and necessary
administrative obligations) to be terminated at or prior to the Effective
Time.   (c) The Company Stock Options assumed or substituted by
Parent pursuant to Section 3.04(a) shall qualify, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options
qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (d) Parent shall reserve a sufficient number of Parent
Ordinary Shares for issuance under this Section 3.04.     -14-  19  
(e) Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) for the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable with respect
to assumed Company Stock Options as promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date, but in no event later than 15 days thereafter, and shall use its best
efforts to maintain such registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form), including the current status of any related prospectus or
prospectuses, for so long as any Company Stock Options remain
outstanding.   (f) Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may
be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.04 and
any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who (i) is a director or officer of Company or (ii) at the Effective Time,
shall become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with
the No Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent,
HoldCo and Merger Sub (the "Parent Companies") as follows except as (i) set
forth with respect to a specifically identified representation and warranty
in the disclosure schedule heretofore delivered to the Parent Companies by
the Company (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), provided that to the extent
such disclosure contains sufficient information to qualify any other
representation and warranty, such disclosure also shall be deemed to qualify
such other representation and warranty; or (ii) disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure should qualify a specific
representation and warranty.   Section 4.01 Due Organization, Good Standing

standing or its equivalent, if any (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize the concept of good standing), under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its organization and has the requisite corporate or other power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority could not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing or its equivalent, if any
(with respect to jurisdictions which recognize the concept of good standing)
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The respective Organizational Documents of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries do not contain any provision limiting or otherwise
restricting the ability of     -15-  20  the Company to control its
Subsidiaries. Section 4.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

No Violations. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, result in any violation of, default or event of
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

against the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the     -19-  24  Company or its Subsidiaries, at
law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority which could

liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) liabilities and

the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective or, in the case
of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at
the time of the initial mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments or
supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in     -31-  36  light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement, as of its
effective date, will comply (with respect to information relating to the
Parent Companies) as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, and as of the date of its initial mailing and as of
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Proxy Statement will comply
(with respect to information relating to the Parent Companies) as to form in

knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its directors, officers,

for accounting purposes or (ii) the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   Section
5.11 Litigation. There is no investigation, action, suit or proceeding

Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold, to
the extent legally required, all Permits that are required for the operation
of the respective businesses of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries as now
conducted, except where the failure to hold any such Permit could not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any default under any
such Permit, except to the extent that such default could not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   ARTICLE VI   COVENANTS   Section 6.01 Conduct of the

the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective for the

Netherlands Merger Committee, the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as Parent\'s prospectus and any other filings

Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the date on which it is cleared by the SEC and the
Registration Statement is declared effective. Parent shall take any
action required to be taken under any applicable foreign securities Laws or
state securities or blue sky Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Ordinary Shares in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all
information     -37-  42  concerning the Company and its stockholders
as may reasonably be requested in connection with any such action. No
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company

Ordinary Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC

Company or Parent discovers any information relating to either party, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.   (c) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement
and if and to the extent required under the Laws of the Netherlands, Parent
shall file with the AEX a prospectus with respect to the listing of Parent
Ordinary Shares with the AEX (this prospectus and such documents included
therein, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "AEX
Documents"). Parent and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the AEX Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the AEX Documents
as so corrected to be filed with the AEX and as so corrected to be publicly
made available in the Netherlands, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws of the Netherlands. The Company and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the AEX Documents
prior to their being filed with the AEX or being publicly made available in
the Netherlands. Parent agrees to provide the Company and its counsel with
any comments Parent or its counsel may receive from the AEX or its staff with
respect to the AEX Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and
shall provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to review and
comment on the response of Parent to such comments.   Section 6.05 No
Solicitation.   (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys
and other advisors, representatives and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, activity, discussions or negotiations with third parties with
respect to any Takeover Proposal. From and after the date hereof, the Company
shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries, nor
shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of or any
financial advisor, attorney or other advisor, representative or agent of it
or any of its Subsidiaries, to (i) directly or indirectly, solicit,
facilitate, initiate or encourage, including by way of furnishing    
-38-  43  information, the making or submission of any Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to
any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person (other than a party to this
Agreement) any information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal or (iv)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of the Company\'s equity securities or any other equity
interest; provided that, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
in response to an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that did not result from the
breach of this Section 6.05 and following delivery to Parent of written
notice of the Takeover Proposal in compliance with its obligations under
Section 6.05(c), the Company may participate in discussions or negotiations
with or furnish information (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with
customary terms) to any third party which makes a bona fide written
unsolicited Takeover Proposal if and only to the extent that (a) a majority
of the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (b) a majority of the Company\'s
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.05 by any of its, or any of its Subsidiaries\',
officers, employees, or directors or any advisor, representative, consultant
or agent retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall
constitute a breach of this Section 6.05 by the Company.   For purposes of
this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or group relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of 15% or more of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity securities or other equity
interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities or other equity interest
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, sale of all of the assets, recapitalization,
liquidation or a dissolution of, or similar transaction of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries other than the Merger or (iv) any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
transactions (whether or not related); and "Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide written Takeover Proposal to purchase all or substantially all of
the outstanding equity securities of the Company (x) on terms which a
majority of the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors) to be superior to the Company and
its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) (taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and identity of the offeror) as compared to the transactions
contemplated hereby and any alternative proposed by Parent and (y) which is
reasonably capable of being consummated.     -39-  44   (b) Except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.05, neither the Board of Directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to any Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining
Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company receives
a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if
it determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation
with its outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, withdraw or modify the Recommendation, or take a position
permitted by Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act in order to
comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (provided that
any such withdrawal or modification shall not change the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statute or other state Law or the Rights Agreement to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), but only at a time that is
after the third Business Day following Parent\'s compliance with
its obligations set forth in Section 6.05(c) with the intent of enabling
Parent to agree to a modification of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected.  
(c) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.05, as promptly as

place. The Company agrees that it shall inform Parent of any material changes
of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company agrees that it
shall simultaneously provide to Parent any nonpublic information concerning
the Company provided to any other Person or group in connection with any
Takeover Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.   Section
6.06 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and the Parent Companies shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur could be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or any covenant, condition
or agreement not to be complied with or satisfied at any time from the date
of this Agreement to the Effective Time. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other communication
from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.     -40-  45   Section 6.07 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject
to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company and each of the

or other third party or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Authority or other third party in connection with this
Agreement.   Section 6.09 Antitrust Filings.   (a) Without limiting the
generality of Section 6.08, the Company and each of the Parent Companies

other in connection with any such filing and with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
commenced by any Governmental Authority (including the Federal Trade

covenants of the Company and Parent contained in Section 6.08 and Section
6.09(a), each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Antitrust Law. If any administrative, judicial or legislative action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative
of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and use
its commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event     -41-  46  shall Parent be
required to, or the Company be permitted to, agree to any divestiture of any
businesses, assets or product lines of the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in order to enable any approval under any Antitrust
Law that is necessary to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, in accordance with their respective terms, to
be received.   (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform
the other of any material communication received by such party or any of
its Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and
Parent shall advise the other promptly of any understandings, undertakings
or agreements which such party or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries
proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 6.10 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\'

Effective Time.   (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent and HoldCo shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to keep in effect in its Organizational
Documents a provision for a period of not less than six years from the

Time which have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, until such matters are finally resolved) which provides for
indemnification of the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL. Parent and HoldCo shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor the indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors
and officers as set forth in Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (c) Parent and HoldCo shall cause to be maintained in effect
for not less than six years from the Effective Time the current policies of
the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance ("DandO; Insurance")

therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties and
provided there shall be no lapse of coverage) with respect to matters
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent
and HoldCo shall not be required to pay an annual premium for DandO; Insurance

possible for such amount.   Section 6.11 Public Announcements. The Parent
Companies and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such

"affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and for the purposes of applicable interpretations regarding
the pooling-of-interests business combination method ("Rule 145/Pooling
Affiliates"). Each party shall exercise all reasonable best efforts to

dependents than those presently in effect. Nothing contained herein shall
prohibit Parent, HoldCo or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with
applicable Law.   (b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication
of benefits, Parent and HoldCo shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give employees of the Company full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent
in which such employees are eligible to participate for such employees\'
service with the Company to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent and HoldCo shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees under
any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to     -43- 
48  participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) provide each such employee with credit for any co-payment offsets, out-
of-pocket deductibles and similar expenses paid prior to the Effective Time
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket and similar expense
requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time.   (c) Parent and HoldCo agree that
the Company shall honor, in accordance with their respective terms and, on
and after the Effective Time, Parent and HoldCo shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, all written employment, severance and similar

If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
antitakeover Law shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any provision of the DGCL, or any antitakeover provision
contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, each of the Parent Companies and the Company, and the
Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of Parent and the Boards of
Directors of the Company, HoldCo and Merger Sub shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the

Pooling-of-Interests; Tax Treatment.   (a) Each of the Parent Companies and
the Company agrees that it shall not take any action, or fail to take any
action, which action or failure to act could be reasonably likely to cause
the Merger to fail to qualify (i) as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) for pooling-of-interest business
combination accounting treatment under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 16.   (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the tax opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to the Company, referred to in Section 7.02(d) and (ii)
the letter from Deloitte and Touche LLP, its independent accountants, referred
to in Section 7.03(e)(ii).   (c) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain (i) the tax opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP, counsel to Parent, referred to in Section 7.03(f) ; and (ii) the letter
from Deloitte and Touche LLP, its independent accountants, referred to in
Section 7.03(e)(i).   (d) The Company, Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub each
agree that if the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.02(d) and
7.03(f) shall not be satisfied because either Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, or Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and    
-44-  49  Flom LLP, as applicable, is unable to opine that the Merger shall
be treated for Federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code as it is currently structured, the
parties will use reasonable best efforts to amend this Agreement to
restructure the proposed Merger as the merger of a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent with and into the Company in a transaction treated for
Federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(a) of the Code.   (e) The parties agree that no amount paid or
payable with respect to any statutory appraisal rights will be paid or
reimbursed by any of the Parent Companies.   Section 6.17 Letters of
Accountants. Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent letters of Deloitte and Touche LLP,
in its capacity as the Company\'s independent accountants and Deloitte and
Touche LLP, in its capacity as the Parent\'s independent accountants,
respectively, dated the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective and as of the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (and
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent), that are customary in form,
scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with transactions such as those contemplated by this Agreement
and the Registration Statement.   Section 6.18 Series 1 Preferred Stock. As
promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall notify the holders of outstanding shares of the Company
Series 1 Preferred Stock that pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of
Designations of the Company Series 1 Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of
Designations") (i) the consummation of the Merger was deemed to be a
liquidation of the Company and (ii) that each share of Company Series 1
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was automatically
and without further action canceled, retired and ceased to exist as of the
Effective Time and thereafter represented only the right to receive from
Parent, upon surrender by the holder thereof to the Surviving Corporation of
the certificate representing such share, the number of Parent Ordinary
Shares that such holder would have been entitled to receive if such holder
had converted the shares represented by the surrendered certificates into
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of
Designations and thereafter such shares had been converted in the Merger as
set forth in Section 3.01(c). Upon the surrender of any certificate
representing shares of Company Series 1 Preferred Stock, Parent shall
promptly deliver to the holder of such shares of Company Series 1 Preferred
Stock the number of Parent Ordinary Shares that such holder would have been
entitled to receive if such holder had converted the shares represented by
the surrendered certificates into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the terms of the Certificate of Designations and thereafter such shares had
been converted in the Merger as set forth in Section 3.01(c)   Section 6.19
Employment Agreements. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent in its
efforts to negotiate employment or other agreements with key employees
identified by Parent between the date hereof and the Effective Time.  
Section 6.20 U.S. Operations. Parent acknowledges and agrees that it intends
to maintain a substantial presence in the United States to support research,

(f) by either the Company or Parent, if there shall have been a material

this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement is terminated by Parent in

available funds upon the earlier of (a) the consummation of a Takeover
Proposal or any transaction that, if it had been proposed prior to the
termination of this Agreement would have constituted a Takeover Proposal and
(b) the entering into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a
definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction. If the Company
fails to pay to Parent any fee due hereunder (including the Termination Fee),
the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on
