Company Equity Plan.

  



  

Section 3.2. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering any Company Equity Plan) will take all actions, including the
obtaining of any required waivers or consents, as it deems necessary or
appropriate to give effect to this _Section 3.2_ to provide that:

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is then outstanding and that has an exercise price per Share equal to
or less than the Cash Merger Consideration in respect of one Share (whether
or not then vested or exercisable) (each such Company Option, a " _Cash-Out
Option_ ") shall be cancelled and terminated, and each holder of a Cash-Out
Option shall have the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in
respect of such Cash-Out Option, (i) an amount in cash (less
applicable withholding taxes, if any) equal to (A) the number of Shares
subject to such Cash-Out Option, _multiplied by_ (B) the excess of (1) the
Cash Merger Consideration, if any, over (2) the exercise price per share of
such Cash-Out Option, payable as part of the next full payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date and (ii) the Spinco
Consideration Equivalent Amount in respect of the number of Shares subject to
such Cash-Out Option. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is then outstanding and that has an exercise price per
Share greater than the Cash Merger Consideration (each such Company Option, a
" _Non-Cash-Out Option_ ") shall be cancelled and terminated, and each holder
thereof shall have the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in
respect of such Non-Cash-Out Option, the Spinco Consideration
Equivalent Amount in respect of the number of Shares subject to such Non-
Cash-Out Option.

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Share that is then outstanding shall be cancelled and terminated, and
each holder of a Company Restricted Share shall have the right to receive
from the Surviving Corporation, in respect of such Company Restricted Share,
(i) an amount in cash (less applicable withholding taxes, if any) equal to (A)
the number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share award,
_multiplied by_ (B) the Cash Merger Consideration, payable as part of the next
full payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date
and (ii) the Spinco Consideration.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Stock Unit that is then outstanding shall be cancelled and terminated,
and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit shall have the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, in respect of such Company Restricted
Stock Unit, (i)(A) an amount in cash (less applicable withholding taxes, if
any) equal to the number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit award (assuming, in the case of Company Restricted Stock Unit awards that
are subject to performance-based vesting, that the performance goals are
satisfied at 133% of target level performance), _multiplied by_  (B) the Cash
Merger Consideration, payable as part of the next full payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date and (ii) the Spinco
Consideration in respect of the number of Shares subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit award (assuming, in the case of Company Restricted
Stock Unit awards that are subject to performance-based vesting, that the
performance goals are satisfied at 133% of target level performance).

  



  

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate the Company Equity Plans and any other Company Plan (or provision
thereof) that provides for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect
of Shares. The Company shall not be required to terminate the Company's
401(k) Plan pursuant to the preceding sentence other than any provision
thereof that requires the issuance of any interest in respect of Shares at or
following the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, neither the Company
nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries shall be bound by any rights under the
Company Equity Plans or any other Company Plan (or provision thereof) that
provides for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of Shares,
except for the Company's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has complied in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and after the
Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such appraisal
rights will not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided under
Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him, her or it
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right to
appraisal, in which case such Shares will be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of certificates or book-entry shares, pursuant to _Section
3.4_. The Proxy Statement will include a notice complying with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL concerning the rights of the stockholders of the
Company to exercise appraisal rights and a copy of the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL.

  



  

(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any
written demands for appraisal (including copies of such demands),
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

  



    

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) If any Company stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares
effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such stockholder's right to obtain payment of the fair value of such
stockholder's Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such
stockholder's Shares will no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the
occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective
Time, will be treated as if the stockholder had, as of the Effective Time,
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, as set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_. Parent shall promptly deposit with
the Paying Agent any additional funds necessary to pay in full the Cash
Merger Consideration so due and payable to such stockholder who shall have
withdrawn or lost such right to obtain payment of the fair market value of
such Dissenting Shares.

  



  

Section 3.4. _Surrender of Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the stockholders of the Company (other than any holders of
Dissenting Shares) the aggregate consideration payable to the holders of
Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_  (but which cash shall not, for the
avoidance of doubt, be for payments in respect of Cash-Out Options, Company
Restricted Shares or Company Restricted Units, which shall be paid by the
Company through its payroll system as part of its next full payroll
cycle following the Closing Date). In addition, at the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to the Paying Agent a single stock certificate, endorsed by the
Company, representing all of the outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock
then owned by the Company, which number of shares shall equal the aggregate
Spinco Consideration. Such cash may be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent;  _provided_ , that such investments will be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

  



  

(b) No fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Shares, no dividends or other distributions of
Spinco shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Spinco. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Spinco shall direct the Paying Agent to determine the number of whole shares
and fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock allocable to each holder of
record or beneficial owner of Company Common Stock, Cash-Out Options and
Company Restricted Stock Units as of the Record Date, to aggregate all such
fractional shares and sell the whole shares obtained thereby at the direction
of Spinco, in open market transactions, at then-prevailing trading prices,
and to cause to be distributed to each such holder or for the benefit of each
such beneficial owner to which a fractional share shall be allocable such
holder's or owner's ratable share of the proceeds of such sale, after making
appropriate deductions of the amount required to be withheld for federal
income tax purposes and after deducting an amount equal to all brokerage
charges, commissions and income and transfer taxes attributed to such sale.
The Company and the Paying Agent shall use their reasonable commercial
efforts to aggregate the shares of Company Common Stock that may be held
by any beneficial owner thereof through more than one account in determining
the fractional share allocable to such beneficial owner.

  



    

18

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or evidence of a book-entry share, which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, whose Shares were
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate or book-
entry shares will pass only upon delivery of the certificates or book-entry
shares to the Paying Agent, and will be in such form and have such other
provisions acceptable to the Company and Parent) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
certificates or book-entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate or book-entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and properly completed, the holder of such certificate or book-entry
Share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Cash Merger
Consideration and the Spinco Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such certificate or book-entry Share, and the certificate or
book-entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.4(c)_ , each certificate or
book-entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will
not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a
stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation. The Spinco Common Stock into which the Shares shall be
converted pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the
Effective Time for purposes of entitlement to dividends declared, if any,
after the Effective Time; provided, that no dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Spinco Common Stock, with a record date after the
Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share with
respect to the shares of Spinco Common Stock they are entitled to
receive until such Shares are surrendered by such holder.

  



  

(d) At any time following the date that is one (1) year after the
Effective Time, Parent will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
and any shares of Spinco Common Stock that have been made available to the
Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates and
book-entry Shares (including all dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such shares and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_ ), and thereafter such holders will be entitled
to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon surrender of their certificates and book-entry Shares. Subject
to Section 2.3(b) of the Separation Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will
pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. None
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any portion of the funds or shares of Spinco Common
Stock delivered to the Paying Agent hereunder that is delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such
date on which any Merger Consideration (including all dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares and all cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_ ) shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed, and thereafter there will be no further
registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, certificates and book-entry Shares
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer will be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in, this _ARTICLE III_.

  



  

(f) In the event that any certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder's delivery of an affidavit of loss to the Paying
Agent, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Shares represented by such certificate.

  



  

Section 3.5. _Section 16_. The Company Board will, to the extent
necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Closing Date, to
approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act the disposition
and cancellation of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.6. _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards or any
other recipient of consideration pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under Code or the Treasury
Regulations thereunder or pursuant to any other Legal Requirement. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

Section 3.7. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the
Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered certificate or book-entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it
will be a condition of payment that the certificate or book-entry Share, as
applicable, so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or
book-entry Share, as applicable, surrendered or will have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Any other transfer Taxes will be paid by Parent.

4.5(b)_  have been made, conflict with or violate any Legal Requirement

(b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
each other Transaction Agreement to which it is, or at the Closing will be, a

aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder, or prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

  



  

Section 4.6. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has filed or furnished to the SEC all required
reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and
registration, proxy and other statements required to be filed or furnished to
the SEC, as applicable, since December 29, 2012. None of the
Company's Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of their respective dates, each of the SEC
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each
as in effect on the date so filed. Except to the extent amended or superseded
by a subsequent filing with the SEC made prior to the date hereof, as of
their respective dates (and if so amended or superseded, then on the date
of such subsequent filing), none of the SEC Reports contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect
to the SEC Reports. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the SEC Reports
is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

  



  

(b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes thereto) of the Company included in the
SEC Reports (the " _Financial Statements_ "), as amended or supplemented
prior to the date of this Agreement, have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by
the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects in
conformity with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of cash flows,
as well as the stockholders' equity for the periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited Financial Statements, to normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments and as indicated in the notes thereto,
none of which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, with respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K
and each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q included in the SEC Reports, the
financial statements and other financial information included in such
reports fairly present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in all
material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company as of, and for, the periods presented in such SEC Reports.

(c) The Company has implemented and maintains a system of internal
control over financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, such system of internal control over financial reporting is
effective. For purposes of this _Section 4.6(c)_ , "knowledge of the Company"
means the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company and will not have the meaning ascribed
thereto in _Article I_. The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act)
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames
specified by the SEC's rules and forms (and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective), and has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses known to it in the design or operation of its internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud known to it, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial

sale, sale or use of the products and services of the OEM Solutions Business)
does not infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate, and as conducted
in the past four (4) years, has not materially infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise violated, any third Person's
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no Person is

any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Intellectual Property.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received in the past four
(4) years any written notice of any pending claim, order or proceeding (i)

any Intellectual Property right of any third party, or (ii) challenging the
validity, enforceability, use or exclusive ownership of any Owned Company
Intellectual Property. No Owned Company Intellectual Property is being used

abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Owned Company
Intellectual Property. The Owned Company Intellectual Property is not subject
to any outstanding order restricting the use thereof in any material respect.

  



  

(e) The Company and the Retained Subsidiaries have taken reasonable

Subsidiaries that is material to their businesses as currently conducted or
contemplated to be conducted has been used, disclosed to or discovered by any
Person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure, license or

Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no
employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or the Retained
Subsidiaries is in default or breach of any non-disclosure or confidentiality
agreement, covenant or obligation.

  



  

(f) No open source software or freeware has been incorporated into

Agency_ "), necessary for the lawful operation of the business of the Company
and the Retained Subsidiaries. All of the Permits are valid, and in full

cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any Permit.
The Company and each of the Retained Subsidiaries are in compliance in all

information and data utilized by the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries

Regulatory Agency.

  



  

(d) Since December 29, 2012, neither the Company nor any of the
Retained Subsidiaries, have committed any act, made any statement or
failed to make any statement that would reasonably be expected to provide a
basis for the FDA or any other Company Regulatory Agency to invoke its policy
with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and
Illegal Gratuities", or similar policies set forth in any applicable Legal
Requirements, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company or any of the Retained Subsidiaries.

be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable regulatory authorities. The present value of the accrued
liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is
required under applicable Legal Requirements to be funded, determined as of
the end of the most recently ended fiscal year of the Company or Retained
Subsidiary, as applicable, on the basis of reasonable actuarial assumptions,
did not exceed the then-current value of the assets of such Non-U.S. Plan
allocable to such accrued liabilities. No current or former employee of the
Company or any of the Retained Subsidiaries is entitled to any enhanced
benefits on early retirement or redundancy.

local government or any subdivision thereof or of any foreign government
respecting (a) employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health, and (b)
contributions to employee benefits of whatever nature which the Company and
the Retained Subsidiaries are required by law (including any mandatory
collective agreement) to make in their capacity as an employer. Neither the
Company nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
labor or collective bargaining agreement (other than any industry-wide or
statutorily mandated agreement or any non-material agreement in a non-U.S.
jurisdiction). There is no unfair labor practice charge pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened which if determined adversely to the
Company or the Retained Subsidiaries would be material to the Company or any
of the Retained Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
organizational campaigns, petitions or other activities or proceedings of any
labor union, workers' council or labor organization seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit with respect to, or otherwise attempting to
represent, any of the employees of the Company or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries or compel the Company or any of the Retained Subsidiaries to
bargain with any such labor union, works council or labor organization. There
are no strikes, slowdowns, walkouts or work stoppages pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any of the
Retained Subsidiaries has experienced any such strike, slowdown, walkout, or
work stoppage within the past three (3) years.

_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ ") (provided, that provisions in the Fee Letter
related solely to fees, economic terms (other than covenants) and

or modification is contemplated or pending (other than amendments or
modifications to the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead

creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of
commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). All commitments
and other fees required to be paid under the Commitment Letters prior to the
date hereof have been paid in full, and as of the date hereof Parent is
unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that would
reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Commitment Letters inaccurate or that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Commitment Letters to be ineffective. As
of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and
_7.3_ are satisfied at Closing, Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount
of the Financing will not be available in full to Holdings, Parent and Merger
Sub on the Closing Date. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ and the funding of the Debt Financing in accordance
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the
Commitment Letters when funded, together with cash and cash equivalents
available to Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, will be
sufficient for Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration to
be paid at the Closing and any other amounts required to be paid by Holdings,
Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all related fees and expenses
of Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub required to be paid at the Closing in
connection therewith.

_Section 6.3(a)_ will constitute "Evaluation Materials" under

encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal
or engage in any negotiations with respect thereto, (ii) except for a

_provided_ , that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be
prohibited or deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation. The Company will
immediately cease any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Person
by the Company, the Retained Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent the Company is
contractually permitted to do so, will request the return or destruction of

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
6.4(a)_ , if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, (i) the
Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes is _bona fide_ , and (ii) the Company Board determines that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to or result
in a Superior Proposal or that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then the Company may, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval (but in no event after
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval), and subject to clauses (1) and
(2) below, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Retained Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives and (B) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (1) the
Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or the Retained
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent and (2) the Company will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, disclose any
material non-public information to such Person unless the Company has,
or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
substantially similar confidentiality provisions, in the aggregate, as those
in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company
from complying with this _Section 6.4_.

  



  

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company receives
any Acquisition Proposal or written indication by any Person that it is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
or indication and the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
or indication. The Company will provide Parent promptly (and in any event
within such twenty-four (24) hour period) a copy of any such Acquisition
Proposal or indication and copies of any other written materials received
from or on behalf of such Person relating to such Acquisition Proposal or
indication. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
changes in any Acquisition Proposal or indication, including furnishing copies
of any written correspondence and draft documentation.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.4(a)_ to the contrary,
but subject to the provisions of _Section 6.3(e)_ , if (i) the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes is
_bona fide_ , and (ii) the Company Board concludes such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements, (A) effect a Change of Board Recommendation and/or (B)
terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
transaction that is a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated by the Company in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_.

  



    

48 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.4(d)_  with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has complied in all
material respects with this _Section 6.4_ , (ii) the Company has provided
prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance of
its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal,
which notice specifies the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and includes a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, (iii)
during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith
(to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iv)
following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require the Company
to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 6.4(e)_.

  



  

Section 6.5. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and each of the
Retained Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Closing and ending on
December 31, 2015, to maintain for the individuals employed by the Company or
the Retained Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and who (i) remain employed
by the Surviving Corporation or the Retained Subsidiaries or (ii) become
employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Surviving
Corporation or the Retained Subsidiaries), in each case, following the
Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") (A) base compensation and annual
target cash incentive compensation (expressed as a percentage of base
compensation or as a fixed dollar amount, as applicable, and excluding any
cash incentive compensation required to be disclosed pursuant to _Section
4.13(f)(i)_ (other than any amounts described in _Section 6.5(c)_ below) at
least as favorable to the employee as at the Effective Time and (B) benefits
provided under employee benefit plans of Parent or its Affiliates that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits maintained for and
provided to Current Employees as a group immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.5_ will
prevent the amendment or termination of any particular Company Plan or the
termination of employment of any Current Employee or interfere with the
Surviving Corporation's right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary, or act in any other manner, to conform with applicable Legal
Requirements.

  



  

(b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
service rendered by Current Employees with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting
and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, under any defined
benefit plan) under employee benefit plans of Parent or its affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation and the Retained Subsidiaries, to the same extent as
such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans for
those purposes, except where such service credit would result in the
duplication of benefits. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i)
Current Employees will not be subject to any eligibility requirements or pre-
existing condition limitations under any employee health benefit plan of
Parent or its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation or the Retained
Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Current Employees are given credit under
such employee benefit plans for pre-Closing co-payments made and amounts paid
toward deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limitations in the year in which
the Effective Time occurs.

  



    

49

--- 

    



  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each employee of the
Company and the Retained Subsidiaries who then participates in the
Company's 2014 Cash Bonus Program (the " _Cash Bonus Program_ ") and who
remains employed through the Effective Time shall vest in and become entitled
to receive a cash payment from the Company, payable on the Closing Date, equal
to the product of (i) the annual bonus award that would be earned by the
employee for the year in which the Effective Time occurs under the Cash
Bonus Program (assuming a full year of performance) based upon actual
performance through the Closing Date, as reasonably determined by the
Company, and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
elapsed in the plan year from the commencement of the plan year until the
date on which the Effective Time occurs and the denominator of which is 365
(the " _Bonus_ ");  _provided_ , that the aggregate Bonus amount payable to
all employees of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 6.5(c)_ shall not exceed $4,100,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to those employees of the Company who are employed by Spinco or
its Subsidiaries or whose employment is transferred to Spinco in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement and who
participate in the Cash Bonus Program immediately prior to the Closing (the "
_Spinco Bonus Employees_ "), immediately prior to the Effective Time the
Company will, in lieu of the foregoing, transfer to Spinco an amount in cash
equal to the aggregate Bonus amount payable to the Spinco Bonus Employees as
of the Effective Time as calculated in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence; _provided_ , that the aggregate Bonus amount payable to
Spinco in respect of the Spinco Bonus Employees Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 6.5(c)_ shall not exceed $1,600,000.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement in their capacities as such. No provision of
this _Section 6.5_ shall (i) give any third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this _Section 6.5_ , (ii) obligate Parent, the Company, any
Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing to retain the
employment of any particular employee for any period of time or preclude
Parent, the Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing from terminating the employment of any such employee at any time and
for any or no reason, or (iii) be deemed to constitute the adoption of, or an
amendment to, any Company Plan or other employee benefit arrangement governing
any current or former employee or individual consultant of Parent, the
Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 6.6. _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub will cause the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities of present and former directors, officers and
employees of the Company (each, together with such person's heirs, executors
or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") than are currently provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the indemnification agreements currently in place
between the Company and any such Persons and set forth on _Section 6.6(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, which provisions will not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, or, in the event that any Proceeding is pending or asserted or
any claim made during such period, until the disposition of any such
Proceeding or claim, unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required
by applicable Legal Requirements, in which case Parent agrees, and will cause
the Surviving Corporation, to make such changes to the certificate
of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the least adverse affect on the
rights of the individuals referenced in this _Section 6.6_.

  



    

50 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) The Company will purchase by the Effective Time tail policies to
the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
at such time by the Company, which tail policies (i) will be effective for a
period from the Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years
after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and (ii) will
contain coverage that is at least as protective to such directors and
officers as the coverage provided by such existing policies. Parent will cause
such policies to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(c) This  _Section 6.6_ will survive the consummation of the Merger
and is intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, any
Indemnified Party. The rights provided for in this _Section 6.6_ will not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume the
applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

Section 6.7. _Further Action; Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to
the Effective Time, each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements to
consummate the Separation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree to (i) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days
after the date of the Agreement), and (ii) supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act. The parties will also consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree (A) to give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust
Laws, (B) to give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such
meetings, (C) to the extent practicable, to give each other reasonable advance
notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (D) if any Governmental Entity initiates a
substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, to promptly
notify the other party of the substance of such communication, (E) to provide
each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon
all written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental Entity
regarding any Antitrust Laws and (F) to provide each other with copies of all
written communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to
any Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or
any of its Affiliates be required to sell, divest or dispose of assets,
properties or businesses (including assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it under this Agreement) having an aggregate value at the time
such assets, properties or businesses are proposed to be sold, divested or
disposed of, in excess of $2,000,000. Any such disclosures or provision of
copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis if
appropriate. In no event shall Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub be required to
(nor will the Company, without Parent's consent, which may be withheld at
Parent's sole discretion) pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contractual
Obligation. Nothing in this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

  



    

51

--- 

    



  

(b) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Entity challenging the Merger, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will cooperate in all respects with each other and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, each party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third
parties with respect to any Contractual Obligations to which it is a party as
may be necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or required by the terms of any Contractual Obligation as a
result of the execution, performance or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event will the Company
or its Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee,
penalty or other consideration to any third party to obtain any
consent, approval or waiver required with respect to any such Contractual
Obligation.

  



  

Section 6.8. _Proxy Statement; SpinCo Registration Statement;
Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) The Company will prepare and will cause to be filed with the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement a
proxy statement/prospectus (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the meeting of
the Company's stockholders to be held to consider the adoption and approval of
this Agreement, and the Merger, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
clear the Proxy Statement with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable. The
Company will include in the Proxy Statement the text of this Agreement, the
Fairness Opinion, and the Company Recommendation (unless the Company Board
has made a Change of Board Recommendation in compliance with _Section 6.4_ or
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3_ ), and will use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement. None of the
information included in the Proxy Statement or the Spinco Registration
Statement will, at the time the Spinco Registration Statement is declared
effective, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, or at the time of the Stockholders'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Spinco Registration Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement, the Spinco Registration Statement or the other filings shall not

opportunity to review and comment on such documents or responses and shall
include comments reasonably proposed by Parent in such documents or
responses, and (ii) prior to filing the Spinco Registration Statement

Meeting shall not be affected by a Change of Board Recommendation, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, use its reasonable best
efforts to advise Parent during the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the
date of the Stockholders' Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

Section 6.22. _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including, to the extent required in accordance with
the terms thereof, the exercise of so-called "flex" provisions in the Fee
Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions precedent to funding applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements to be entered into
pursuant thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and, upon the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_
and _7.3_ , such Commitment Letters and such Financing Agreements, to
consummate the Financing no later than the Closing in accordance with _Section
2.2_ , and (B) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters until
the funding of the Financing and to negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to such Debt Financing consistent with the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to any
applicable "flex" provisions of the Fee Letter) or, if applicable, on terms
that are no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any "flex" provisions
applicable thereto) (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) upon the
satisfaction of all conditions precedent to funding in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Financing Agreements, enforce the obligations of the Financing
Sources to fund the Debt Financing, and (iii) comply in all material respects
with their obligations under the Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements, to the extent within their control. Upon the reasonable request
of the Company, Parent shall reasonably promptly update the Company in
reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of the
Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company, upon
reasonable request, with copies of any Financing Agreements and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (subject to any applicable "flex" provisions of the Fee
Letter), (A) Parent shall notify the Company, and (B) Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative
Financing_ "), upon terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, in an aggregate amount that, when taken together with the
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and the
available portion of the Debt Financing and cash and cash equivalents
available to Parent and Merger Sub, would be sufficient to pay the aggregate
Cash Merger Consideration to be paid by Merger Sub at the Closing and any
other amounts required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to pay all related fees and expenses of Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub
required to be paid at the Closing in connection therewith. In the event any
Alternative Financing is obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.22(a)_ ,
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to refer
to such Alternative Financing to the extent the Debt Financing has been
replaced thereby, if one or more commitment letters are entered into in
connection with such Alternative Financing (such commitment letters, the "
_Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ "), references in this Agreement to the
Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed to refer to the Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent the Debt Commitment Letter has been replaced
thereby, and all obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company pursuant
to this _Section 6.22(a)_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as
the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company with respect to the Debt
Financing replaced thereby. None of Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub shall
permit or consent to (1) any amendment, supplement or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision under, any Commitment Letter if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver (w) imposes new or additional conditions,
or otherwise expands any of the conditions, to the initial funding of the
Financing at Closing from those set forth therein on the date hereof, (x)
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
applicable Commitment Letter ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may
replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof), (y) would reasonably be
expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent the availability
of all or a portion of the Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (z) would reduce the aggregate cash amount
of the Financing to an amount that, when taken together with other funds
available to Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, is not
sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration to be paid by
Merger Sub at the Closing and any other amounts required to be paid by
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all related
fees and expenses of Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub required to be paid at
the Closing in connection therewith, or (2) early termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than in connection with Alternative Financing) or
the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of
any amendment, modification or waiver of any Commitment Letter following
execution thereof, in each case, to the extent entered into prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , that any amendment to the Fee Letter may be redacted to
the extent permitted under _Section 5.11_. Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing (I) of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to any Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement of which Parent obtains
knowledge, (II) of the receipt by any of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice
or other written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any
actual, threatened or alleged material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement
or any provision of the Financing contemplated pursuant to the Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreement (including any proposal by any Financing Source
to withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the terms of (including
the amount of Financing contemplated by) the Commitment Letters), (III)
if for any reason any of Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letters or the Financing Agreements and (IV) of the termination or expiration
prior to Closing of any Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
material information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of
the circumstances referred to in this _Section 6.22(a)_.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, investment bankers, legal counsel, agents,
financial advisors and other advisors and representatives (collectively the "
_Representatives_ ") to provide, all cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including: (i) furnishing Parent
and the Commitment Parties, as promptly as practicable, with the
Required Bank Information and all other available pertinent information and
disclosures relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects) as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in order to consummate the Debt
Financing; (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as arrangers or agents
for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and senior
management and representatives (with appropriate seniority and expertise) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries), presentations, road shows, drafting
sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with prospective lenders and
investors and ratings agencies in connection with the Debt Financing; (iii)
assisting Parent and the Commitment Parties in the preparation of any offering
documents, private placement memoranda, lender presentations, bank
information memoranda, materials for rating agency presentations, projections
and similar documents reasonably required in connection with the Debt
Financing (including the execution and delivery of customary representation or
authorization letters (the " _Authorization Documents_ ")); (iv) facilitating
the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents related to
the Debt Financing on the terms contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and
which will become effective at or after the Effective Time and, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, making available appropriate members of the
Company's senior management to assist in the negotiation of any such
agreements and other documents and instruments; (v) facilitating
the providing of guarantees and the granting of security interests (and
perfection thereof) in collateral and the obtaining of
environmental assessments, third-party consents, surveys and title insurance
at the sole expense of, and as reasonably requested by, Parent;  _provided_ ,
that no perfected security interest, pledge or guarantee shall be effective
until the Effective Time; (vi) requesting from the Company's existing lenders
such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien
terminations, instruments of termination or discharge to be delivered at the
Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all Indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid
off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date; (vii) providing to Parent
and the Commitment Parties all documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, in any case as is requested in writing
by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and
(viii) obtaining legal opinions, landlord and mortgagee waivers, bailee
letters and similar documents customary for financings similar to the Debt
Financing. The Company further agrees to supplement reasonably promptly the
information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.22(b)_ to the extent that
any such information, to the knowledge of the Company, contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make
such information not misleading in any material respect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except to the extent of the execution and delivery of the
Authorization Documents: (A) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or the ongoing operations of the
Company and/or the Company's Subsidiaries; (B) nothing in this _Section
6.22(b)_ shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (1) cause any
condition to the Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ to not be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or (2) reasonably
be expected to conflict with or violate the Company's organizational
documents or any Legal Requirement, or result in the contravention of, or
result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract;
(C) prior to the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability or obligation in connection with the financings contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter except in the case of expenses that are
advanced or reimbursed as provided in _Section 6.22(c)_ ; (D) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into, perform or
authorize any agreement with respect to the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would
be effective prior to the Closing Date; and (E) nothing shall obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide, or cause to be provided, any
legal opinion by its counsel, or to provide any information or take any action
to the extent it would result in a violation of applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
without limiting the Company's cooperation obligations under this _Section
6.22(b)_ with respect to any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or
Alternative Financing, if (i) Parent seeks to obtain any Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing, (ii) the cooperation required to
be provided pursuant to this _Section 6.22(b)_ in connection with such
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing is more
onerous to the Company than what is required to be provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.22(b)_ with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the
date hereof and without giving effect to any Debt Financing Commitment Letter
or the Debt Financing contemplated thereunder (to the extent more onerous, the
" _Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation_ "), and (iii) the Company fails to
provide any portion of such Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation, then such
failure to provide such Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation (A) shall not
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.22(b)_ for purposes of _Article
VIII_ of this Agreement and (B) shall not be the basis for a determination of
non-compliance with clause (a) of the definition of "Marketing Period" (it
being understood that this sentence shall in no way apply to the Company's
cooperation obligations under this _Section 6.22(b)_ with respect to any
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing that does
not constitute Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation). The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

their respective obligations under this _Section 6.22(c)_  and any
information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent such
liabilities or obligations arose out of or resulted from (i) information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries
or any of its or their respective Representatives or (ii) the gross
negligence, fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives. Parent shall,

become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the termination
rights provided in this  _Section 8.2(a)_ will not be available to any party

the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, or such party will have failed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to oppose any such order, decree, ruling or other action;

  



  

(b) if the Stockholders' Meeting (including any adjournments or

or _Section 7.2(b)_ , as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_ unless any such breach or
failure to be true has not been cured within twenty (20) days after written
notice by the Company to Parent informing Parent of such breach or failure to
be true, except that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by
its nature cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section 8.3(a)_ if the Company is then in breach of this Agreement in
any material respect;

  



  

(b) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Company
has complied with _Section 6.4(d)_  and _Section 6.4(e)_ ; or

  



  

(c) if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and after the end of the

terminated and the Merger may be abandoned by Parent at any time prior to the
Closing:

  



  

(a) if the Company has breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case,
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ ,
as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.4(a)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true has not been
cured within twenty (20) days after written notice by Parent to the Company
informing the Company of such breach or failure to be true, except that no
cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the Outside Date; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent may not

(b) if (i) the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Board
Recommendation, (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for Shares
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval and the Company Board fails to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders
(including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders, which
shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days after
commencement, (iii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) the Company fails to include in
the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

  



  

Section 8.5. _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) Any termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to this
_ARTICLE VIII_ will also constitute an effective termination by Merger Sub.

  



  

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , this
Agreement (other than _Section 6.3(b)_ , _ARTICLE VIII_ and _ARTICLE IX_ )
will become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
(or of any of its Representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that, no such
termination will relieve any Person of any liability for damages resulting
from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement, subject to the
provisions of _Section 8.5(f)_.

  



  

(c) In the event that:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_ ;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.4(b)_ ; or

  



  

(iii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional
or withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal, (B) thereafter, this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or
_Section 8.2(c)_ , or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ (with respect to
a breach of _Section 6.4_ ), and (C) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is
terminated;

  



  

then in any such case, the Company will pay Parent a termination fee of
$13,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent. Any payment
required to be made (1) pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this  _Section
8.5(c)_ will be paid promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following termination of this Agreement and (2) pursuant to clause (iii) of
this _Section 8.5(c)_ will be paid promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following the earlier of the execution of a definitive
agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company will not be required to pay the Termination Fee more than
once. For purposes of _Section 8.5(c)(iii)_ , "Acquisition Proposal" will have
the meaning ascribed thereto in _Article I_ , except that the references in
the definition to "twenty percent (20%)" will be replaced by "fifty percent
(50%)". If Parent receives full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 8.5(c)_ , the collection of such fee shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any Proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

  



    

66 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ , then the Company shall pay Parent or
its designees, as promptly as possible (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice for all
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Financing (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), an
amount in cash equal to the lesser of the Parent Expenses and $1,000,000.
Payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.5(d)_
shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 8.5(c)_.

  



  

(e) In the event that:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)_ ; or

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.3(c)_ ;

  



  

then in any such case, if at such time, all conditions to Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger Shall have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are expected to be satisfied as of
the Closing or by actions taken at the Closing or other conditions that are
not satisfied as a result of the events which gave rise to the right to
terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.5(e)_ ), then Parent shall pay to the
Company a termination fee of $27,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_
"). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent will not be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee more than once. If the Company receives full payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.5(e)_ , the collection of
such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters, the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but
subject to the Company's rights set forth in _Section 9.12_ , the
Company's right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.5(e)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, and the stockholders of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub,
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, Financing Sources, managers, members, directors,
officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment
of such amounts none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except that Parent also shall be obligated
with respect to _Section 8.5(g)_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, but subject to Parent's rights in _Section 9.12_ , Parent's
right to receive payment from the Company of (i) the Parent Expenses pursuant
to _Section 8.5(d)_ and/or (ii) the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.5(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except that the Company shall also be
obligated with respect to _Section 8.5(g)_ ). For the avoidance of doubt, (A)
under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in
excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and (B) while the Company
may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section
9.12_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 8.5(d)_ ,
under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the preceding
sentence and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Company Related Party (other than Parent and Merger Sub) shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; 
_provided_ , that following the consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will
not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under any
definitive documentation or commitment letter related thereto.

  



  

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, the
other parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ , and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, commences legal proceeding which results
in a judgment against the other party, with respect to Parent or Merger Sub,
or parties, with respect to the Company for the payment set forth in this
_Section 8.5_ , such paying party shall pay the other party or parties, as
applicable, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received.

--- 

    



  

Section 8.6. _Expenses_. Each party will bear its own fees and
expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that Parent will bear the expenses and costs incurred by the
parties hereto in connection with any HSR Act filings which may be required
for the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.7. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval of this Agreement by the holders of Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares, no amendment
may be made that by applicable Legal Requirements or applicable rule or
regulation of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the holders
of Shares without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither this
_Section 8.7_ nor _Section 8.5(e)_ , _Section 8.5(f)_ , _Section 9.4_ ,
_Section 9.5_ , _Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.9_ or _Section 9.11_ (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of such
Sections) may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived in a manner that
is adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources in any respect without
the written consent of the Financing Sources.

  



  

Section 8.8. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements,
waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies will
not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.
