excess of that which it would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, it shall forthwith make the necessary payments to the
other of them such that each of them shall have received their pro rata
entitlements to the amount of the SPA Deposit and interest earned on the SPA

- 23 \- 

         | (c) |

In the event that the Meritage Closing does not occur as a result of a breach
by KKR of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement
(including circumstances where SemGroup does not complete the Contribution
Closing because the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 are not
satisfied as a result of a breach by KKR of its representations, warranties
or covenants under this Agreement), and all or a portion of the SPA Deposit is
retained by Meritage pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, KKR shall pay
to SemGroup an amount equal to the SemGroup Deposit Amount as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty as a result of the Meritage Closing and the
Contribution Closing not occurring. The remedy set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Party against
KKR in the event of termination of this Agreement.

     | (d) |

In the event that the Meritage Closing does not occur as a result of a breach
by SemGroup of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement (including circumstances where KKR does not complete the
Contribution Closing because the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2
are not satisfied as a result of a breach by SemGroup of its representations,
warranties or covenants under this Agreement), and all or a portion of the SPA
Deposit is retained by Meritage pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement,
SemGroup shall pay to KKR an amount equal to the KKR Deposit Amount as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty as a result of the Meritage Closing
and the Contribution Closing not occurring. The remedy set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Party against SemGroup in the event of termination of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

In the event that the Meritage Closing does not occur as a result of
circumstances such that a payment is required under both of Sections 3.2(c)
and 3.2(d), then neither SemGroup nor KKR shall be entitled to claim for
damages. For greater certainty, in such circumstances, Section 3.2(b) would
continue to apply to the return of all or any part of the SPA Deposit to the
Corporation. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Except as a result of a breach of this Agreement, in no event shall the
Corporation or any other Party be liable to KKR or SemGroup for any interest
on the KKR Deposit Amount or the SemGroup Deposit Amount, respectively, or for
any amount of the SPA Deposit not returned by Meritage.

in relation to any of the Required Transactions. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

To the extent that any of the matters in subparagraphs (iv) through (xv) of
Section 4.4(b) occur:  

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

SemGroup shall promptly provide written notice thereof to KKR, which notice
shall include a description of the transaction, the type and amount of
amount, benefit, value or Taxes involved and the plan for repayment in
accordance with paragraph (ii) below, together with such additional
information as may reasonably be requested by KKR;  

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

SemGroup shall pay to SemCAMS or the Corporation (on a dollar-for-dollar
basis) in cash an amount equal to all amounts, benefits or values removed from
SemCAMS in respect thereof, or all Taxes for which  

---|---|--- 
 



- 28 \- 

         |  SemCAMS has become liable, as applicable, together with
interest on each relevant amount at the Interest Rate from and including the
date on which the relevant amount, value or benefit was received by SemGroup
or its Affiliate, or SemCAMS became liable for the relevant Taxes, as
applicable, until (but excluding) the date of payment in full to SemCAMS or
the Corporation, as applicable, under this Section 4.4(c); and  
---|--- 



     | (iii) |

SemGroup shall promptly provide to KKR reasonable evidence of repayment of the
amounts referenced in paragraph (ii) above. 

---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

 



     | (iv) |

unless subparagraph (v) below applies, any amount payable by SemGroup to
SemCAMS or the Corporation under subparagraph (ii) above shall: 

---|---|--- 



     | (A) |

if paid prior to the Closing Time, be paid as a contribution by SemGroup to
SemCAMS in exchange for additional Contributed Shares; 

---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

if paid at the Closing Time, be paid by way of a deduction to the
Consideration Cash (and, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable
Laws, for all purposes (including tax purposes), the Parties shall treat same
as an adjustment to the purchase price paid by the Corporation in exchange for
the SemGroup Contribution, effective as of the date of the Contribution
Closing); 

---|---|--- 



     | (C) |

if paid after the Closing Time, be paid to the Corporation as an indemnity
payment, and Sections 10.13 and 10.14 shall apply to such payment, _mutatis
mutandis_ ; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

any amounts reimbursed to SemCAMS in respect of withholding tax liability or
remittances of SemCAMS pursuant to the Required Transactions shall be treated
as a reimbursement and not a contribution in exchange for additional
Contributed Shares. 

---|---|--- 
 

A claim under this Section 4.4(c) shall be the sole remedy available to the
Corporation and KKR as a result of, or in relation to, a breach by SemGroup
of Section 4.4(b).



     | (d) |

For the purposes of this Section 4.4, value shall be deemed to have been

owing by it to SemGroup or any of its Affiliates using cash. 

---|---|--- 



   4.5 |

_Adjustments to the KKR Contribution and Consideration Cash_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

The KKR Contribution and the Consideration Cash amount shall be increased by
49% of the amount of any capital contributions made by SemGroup to SemCAMS
from and after the Effective Date until the receipt of the Regulatory
Approvals 

---|---|--- 
 



- 29 \- 

         |  (excluding any refunds, reimbursements or other payments made
pursuant to Section 4.4(c)) plus an amount equal to the interest on such
portion of such capital contribution at the Interest Rate, calculated daily
but not compounded for the period from (and including) the date such
contribution was made to (but excluding) the date on which the Contribution
Closing occurs. SemGroup shall promptly provide written notice of any
such capital contribution to KKR, which notice shall include a description of
the amount of such capital contribution, proposed use of proceeds and the
number of Contributed Shares issued in respect thereof. The number of Common
Shares to be issued to KKR and SemGroup at the Contribution Closing shall be
correspondingly adjusted (provided that no adjustment shall be made in respect
of any amount paid on account of interest), having regard to the principle
that each of SemGroup and KKR are to be issued Common Shares on a $1.00 per
share basis for the net value contributed by each of them, respectively. 
---|--- 



     | (b) |

The KKR Contribution and the Consideration Cash shall be: (i) increased by 49%
of the amount, if any, by which the Net Value Adjustment as of December 31,
2018 exceeds zero dollars; or (ii) decreased by 49% of the amount, if any, by
which the Net Value Adjustment as of December 31, 2018 is less than zero
dollars, provided that the foregoing adjustments shall be based on the Net
Value Adjustment set forth in the Working Capital Statement as prepared and
delivered by SemGroup pursuant to Section 4.6 (such amount, the "Estimated Net
Value Adjustment"). The number of Common Shares to be issued to KKR and
SemGroup at the Contribution Closing shall be correspondingly adjusted, having
regard to the principle that each of SemGroup and KKR are to be issued Common
Shares on a $1.00 per share basis for the net value contributed by each of
them, respectively. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the amounts specified in
the Working Capital Statement are finally determined pursuant to Section 4.7: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

if the Net Value Adjustment specified in the Working Capital Statement as
finally determined pursuant to Section 4.7 is less than the Estimated Net
Value Adjustment, SemGroup shall pay or cause to be paid to the Corporation by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the difference
as a decrease in respect of the Consideration Cash; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

if the Net Value Adjustment specified in the Working Capital Statement as
finally determined pursuant to Section 4.7 is greater than the Estimated Net
Value Adjustment, the Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to SemGroup by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the difference
as an increase in respect of the Consideration Cash. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

The Parties shall work together in good faith to assess and agree upon whether
to fund the Additional Transaction Expenses payable by the Corporation at the
Closing Time by increasing the amount drawn on debt facilities at the Debt
Financing Closing or through additional equity contributions by KKR and
SemGroup to the Corporation. In the event that the Parties are unable to
reach 

---|---|--- 
 



- 30 \- 

         |  agreement by the Closing Time, to the extent that the
Corporation requires additional funding in order to pay the Additional
Transaction Expenses, such funding will be provided by way of additional
equity contributions by KKR and SemGroup to the Corporation at the
Contribution Closing. In either case, (i) the KKR Contribution shall be
increased by 49% of the amount, if any, of the aggregate amount of the
Additional Transaction Expenses that will be funded by shareholder
contributions (and KKR shall be issued one (1) Common Share for each $1.00 of
contribution so made by it), and (ii) the Consideration Cash shall be
decreased by 51% of the amount, if any, of the aggregate amount of the
Additional Transaction Expenses that will be funded by shareholder
contributions (and SemGroup shall be issued one (1) Common Share for each
$1.00 of contribution so made by it). Unless otherwise agreed by
Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement),
any Additional Transaction Expenses payable after the Closing Time will be
funded through debt facilities available to the Corporation.

   4.6 |

_Working Capital Statement_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

As soon as practicable and in any event no later than February 15, 2019,
SemGroup shall prepare and deliver to KKR a statement which includes
calculations of the Net Value Adjustment as of December 31, 2018, based on
actual amounts, and any required adjustment to the KKR Contribution and the
Consideration Cash in accordance with Section 4.5 (the "Working Capital
Statement"). Each amount included in the Working Capital Statement shall be
calculated in accordance with this Agreement and be accompanied by reasonable
supporting detail to evidence SemGroups calculations, explanations and
assumptions for the calculation of such amounts. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Following receipt of the Working Capital Statement, KKR will have thirty (30)
days to review it (the "Review Period"). During the Review Period, SemGroup
shall assist KKR in reviewing and verifying the Working Capital Statement and
make any revisions thereto reasonably required as a result of such review and
shall ensure that KKR and its Representatives are given full access, upon
every reasonable request, to the supporting documentation of SemGroup prepared
in connection with the preparation of the Working Capital Statement to verify
the accuracy, presentation and other matters relating to the preparation of
the Working Capital Statement, and to enable KKR to exercise its rights under
Section 4.7. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

SemGroup and KKR shall each bear their own fees and expenses, including the
fees and expenses of their respective accountants, in preparing or reviewing,
as the case may be, the Working Capital Statement. If a dispute regarding the
Working Capital Statement is submitted for determination to the Independent
Accountant under Section 4.7, the fees and expenses of the Parties and the
Independent Accountant will be paid in accordance with Section 4.7. 

---|---|--- 
 



- 31 \- 

       4.7 |

_Acceptance or Dispute of the_ _Working Capital Statement_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Following receipt of the Working Capital Statement as contemplated by Section
4.6, if KKR objects in good faith to any item on the Working Capital
Statement, KKR shall so notify SemGroup delivering to SemGroup a written
Notice to that effect (the "Notice of Objection") prior to the end of the
Review Period. The Notice of Objection must set out the reasons for KKRs
objection, each item and amount in dispute and reasonable details of the
calculation of that amount. If KKR does not object to any item of the Working
Capital Statement, KKR may so notify SemGroup by delivering a written Notice
to that effect (the "Notice of Acceptance"). 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If KKR does not deliver a Notice of Objection or Notice of Acceptance to
SemGroup prior to the end of the Review Period, KKR will be deemed to have
delivered a Notice of Acceptance to SemGroup the last day of the Review Period
and the Working Capital Statement will be deemed to be final and binding for
purposes of the payments referred to in Section 4.5. For greater certainty,
no Party may attempt to dispute, recover, recoup, duplicate or adjust any
amount which that Party is required to pay or entitled to receive as a result
of the payments referred to in Section 4.5 by making a Claim for Losses under
Article 10. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If KKR delivers a Notice of Objection, the Parties shall work expeditiously
and in good faith to resolve all of the items in dispute set out in the
Notice of Objection within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Notice
of Objection. Any items in dispute (and only such items) that are not resolved
by the end of that thirty (30) day period will be submitted by the Parties
for determination to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by the
Parties or, if the Parties are unable to agree on the independent accounting
firm within a further three (3) Business Days, to PricewaterhouseCoopers in
their Calgary, Alberta offices. In making its determination, the selected
accounting firm (the "Independent Accountant") will act as expert and not as
arbitrator, must only consider the items in dispute submitted to it, and must
make all reasonable efforts to determine the items in dispute no later than
twenty (20) Business Days of the matter being submitted to the Independent
Accountant. Each Partys submissions to the Independent Accountant shall be
made in writing and delivered to the Independent Accountant (with simultaneous
copy to the other Party) within ten (10) Business Days of the matter being
submitted to the Independent Accountant. There shall be no ex
parte communications between a Party, on the one hand, and the Independent
Accountant, on the other hand, relating to those matters in dispute, other
than the initial written submissions by each Party of their respective
positions on the matters in dispute and written answers by a Party to written
questions from the Independent Accountant, with simultaneous copies to each
Party. With respect to each disputed line item, the Independent Accountants
determination, if not in accordance with the position of one of the Parties,
shall not be in excess of the highest nor less than the lowest of the amounts
advocated in any Notice of Objection or in the Working Capital Statement with
respect to such disputed line item. The determination of the Independent
Accountant will be final and binding upon the Parties and will not be 

---|---|--- 
 



- 32 \- 

         |  subject to appeal, absent manifest error, and the calculations
of the Net Value Adjustment, the adjusted KKR Contribution and the adjusted
Consideration Cash as determined by the Independent Accountant will be final
and binding for purposes of the payments referred to in Section 4.5. For
greater certainty, no Party may appeal a determination made by the Independent
Accountant or attempt to dispute, recover, recoup, duplicate or adjust any
amount which that Party is required to pay or entitled to receive as a result
of that determination or the payments referred to in Section 4.5 by making a
Claim for Losses under Article 10\. The Independent Accountant, in its sole
and absolute discretion, shall determine the proportion of its fees and
expenses to be paid by SemGroup, on the one hand, and KKR, on the other hand,
based primarily on the degree to which the Independent Accountant has accepted
the positions of the respective Parties in relation to the disputed matters. 
---|--- 



     | (d) |

Notwithstanding Article 11, the procedure set out in this Section 4.7 for
resolving disputes with respect to the Working Capital Statement is the sole
and exclusive method of resolving those disputes, absent manifest error or
Fraud. However, this Section 4.7 will not: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

prohibit a Party from commencing litigation to compel specific performance of
this Section 4.7 or to enforce the determination of the Independent
Accountant; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

prohibit a Party from exercising its rights under Article 11, if the basis of
the dispute could also entitle that Party to make a Claim for Losses under
Article 10 and (a) that Claim is not discovered until after the delivery of
the Working Capital Statement under Section 4.6 that Claim involves the
Fraudulent act of the other Party.

   4.8 |

_Section_ __ _ 116 Compliance_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Provided that the Contribution Closing occurs, SemGroup shall be liable for
and, as a separate and independent covenant, agrees to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless and release the KKR Indemnitees and the Corporation from and
against, any Taxes due and owing by, and all Taxes imposed on or incurred by,
SemGroup pursuant to section 116 of the Tax Act resulting from the completion
of the Required Transactions and the Contribution Transaction ("SemGroup
Taxes"), including any liability imposed or that may be imposed upon the KKR
Indemnitees or the Corporation or both pursuant to section 116 of the Tax Act
in connection therewith, including any interest or penalties that arise in
connection with a failure to withhold and remit SemGroup Taxes within the
timeframe prescribed by section 116(5) of the Tax Act or within the timeframe
indicated by the CRA in circumstances where a comfort letter has previously
been provided that extended the timeframe prescribed by section 116(5) of the
Tax Act. Any payment made by SemGroup in respect of the foregoing shall not
give rise to any financial or ownership interest of the SemGroup in the
Corporation and shall not be an adjustment to the contributed value of the
Contributed Shares and Section 10.13 shall apply to such payment, _mutatis
mutandis_.  

---|---|--- 
 



- 33 \- 

         | (b) |

Concurrent with the Contribution Closing, SemGroup shall deliver to the
Corporation the SemGroup Performance Guarantee (the "Security"). 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The Security shall be immediately returned to SemGroup promptly following the
date that SemGroup provides to KKR (i) one or more Section 116 Certificates
with an aggregate certificate limit that is equal to or greater than the cost
to the Corporation of the Contributed Shares (taking into account the
adjustment contemplated by Sections 4.5 and 4.9 and any other adjustment
hereunder to the purchase price paid by the Corporation in exchange for the
SemGroup Contribution) or (ii) a certificate issued under subsection 116(4) of
the Tax Act in respect of the SemGroup Contribution.  

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Neither the Corporation nor KKR shall withhold any amounts in respect of Taxes
in respect of the SemGroup Contribution excluding amounts paid pursuant to
Article 10 and excluding any withholding required under Part XIII of the Tax
Act. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

The Parties agree that the form and content of each of the Section 116
Certificates and the certificate issued under subsection 116(4) of the Tax
Act in respect of the SemGroup Contribution, as applicable, shall be
satisfactory to KKR, acting reasonably. 

---|---|---

positive Final Investment Decision in respect of the K3 Cogen Facility on or
before May 31, 2019:



     | (a) |

the KKR Contribution and the Consideration Cash amount shall be increased by
the amount of CAD $14,700,000 (the "KKR Additional Contribution"); 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

KKR shall promptly pay the Corporation the KKR Additional Contribution and the
Corporation shall issue 14,700,000 Common Shares to KKR; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

as additional consideration for the SemGroup Contribution (i) in settlement of
the adjustment to the Consideration Cash pursuant to Section 4.9(a), the
Corporation shall pay an amount (the "K3 Adjustment Cash") equal to the KKR
Additional Contribution to SemGroup and (ii) the Corporation shall issue
15,300,000 Common Shares to SemGroup. 

---|---|--- 

To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Laws, for all purposes
(including tax purposes), the Parties shall treat the transactions under this
Section 4.9 as an adjustment to the purchase price paid by the Corporation in
exchange for the KKR Contribution and the SemGroup Contribution, effective as
of the date of the Contribution Closing.

SemGroup shall prepare, prior to the Closing Date, all documentation necessary

acquisition in 2015.

The Parties have identified the following potential optimizations of ownership
arrangements pertaining to the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement and the
Corporation:



     | (a) |

replacement of the Special Share to be issued to SemGroup at the Contribution

such arrangements to SemGroup without adversely impacting the Corporation or

- 45 \- 

         | (b) |

alternatives to the IPO structuring contemplated in the Unanimous Shareholder

Party without adversely impacting the other Parties, or the marketability or
value of the shares of the IPO issuer.  

---|---|--- 

Following execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall meet to discuss in
good faith such potential optimizations and the manner in which they could be

_Initial Approved Annual Budget_ 

---|--- 
 

Following execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall in good faith work
cooperatively to develop the Initial Approved Annual Budget and the Initial
Approved Business Plan prior to the Closing Time. If the Parties cannot agree
on the final versions thereof by the Closing Time, the budget and business
plan attached as Schedule "I" will, together, be deemed to be the
Initial Approved Annual Budget for purposes of the Unanimous Shareholder
Agreement, and expenditures made by the Corporation in accordance therewith
will be deemed to be Budgeted Expenditures; provided, however, until a
replacement Initial Approved Annual Budget is approved by Extraordinary
Resolution, the Corporation shall not be permitted to make any Capital Calls
for such Budgeted Expenditures (other than Compliance Expenditures and
Emergency Expenditures in accordance with the terms of the Unanimous
Shareholder Agreement). Capitalized terms used in this Section, but not
otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings given to them in the
Unanimous Shareholder Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a
condition of completion of the Contribution Transactions, or execution of the
Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, that the Parties agree on the final versions
of the Initial Approved Annual Budget and the Initial Approved Business Plan.

       10.4 |

_Limitation of Liability_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, from and after the
Contribution Closing, SemGroup has no Liability for, or any obligation to
make any payment for, Losses (for indemnification or otherwise) in respect of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, including all
provisions in Section 7.2, or the other Contribution Documents, being untrue,
inaccurate or incorrect, and for the purpose of Section 10.1, a breach or non-
fulfillment of any agreement, term or covenant does not include that a
representation or warranty made on the part SemGroup in this Agreement being
untrue. KKR shall cause the representation and warranty insurance policies
issued by Chubb Insurance Company of Canada, Euclid Transactional, LLC and
Ethos Specialty Insurance Services, LLC in favour of the KKR Indemnitees in
respect of the Contribution Transaction (the "RandW Insurance Policy") (the cost
of which shall be for the sole account of the Corporation) to be issued at the
Contribution Closing (in accordance with the terms of the binder thereof) and
remain in full force and effect for the term of such RandW Insurance Policy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the KKR
Indemnitees shall not have any recourse to SemGroup for Losses as a result
of, arising out of, or related to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of SemGroup in this Agreement or the other
Contribution Documents, other than claims for Fraud, and (ii) the sole and
exclusive remedy and recourse of the KKR Indemnitees and the Corporation for
Losses as a result of, arising out of, or related to any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of SemGroup in this Agreement or
the other Contribution Documents, other than claims for Fraud, shall be to
recover under the RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW Insurance Policy shall
expressly provide that the insurer(s) issuing the RandW Insurance Policy shall
waive or otherwise not pursue any subrogation rights against SemGroup and any
of SemGroups Affiliates or any of their respective equityholders or
Representatives, except in the case of Fraud, as applicable. From and after
the date hereof, neither KKR nor the Corporation shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to not) grant any right of subrogation or otherwise
amend, modify, terminate, or waive any term or condition of the RandW Insurance
Policy in a manner inconsistent with the immediately preceding sentence
or otherwise in a manner adverse to SemGroup, any of SemGroups Affiliates or
any of their respective equityholders or Representatives. To the extent that
SemGroup would be liable for Losses under Section 10.1 and such Losses would
also be covered by the RandW Insurance Policy then KKR and the Corporation
shall seek recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy first prior to making any
Claims against SemGroup in respect of such matters pursuant to any right of
indemnification against SemGroup arising under Section 10.1. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

In the cases of Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by the KKR Indemnitees
or the Corporation which SemGroup is liable hereunder, each of KKR and the 

---|---|--- 
 



- 76 \- 

         |  Corporation agree and confirm that, notwithstanding any
provisions of this Agreement, it will take commercially reasonable steps
required by law to mitigate such Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Losses,
including if a Claim may be reduced by any recovery under or pursuant to any
insurance coverage (and Purchaser will provide prompt notice to the insurer
of applicable Losses that would apply towards satisfaction of such retention
amount), taking commercially reasonable steps to enforce such recovery. For
certainty, the commercially reasonable efforts of each of KKR and the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 10.4(b) shall not include any efforts
which, in its reasonable opinion, will materially adversely impact its
business.

   10.5 |

_Exclusive Remedies_

     | (a) |

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the Meritage Closing
does not occur:  

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of SemGroup for any misrepresentation
or breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of KKR contained in any
Contribution Document shall be the remedy set forth in Section 3.2(c); 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of KKR for any misrepresentation or
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of SemGroup contained in any
Contribution Document shall be the remedy set forth in Section 3.2(d); and 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

the Corporation shall not have any monetary liabilities to any other Party for
any misrepresentation or breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
contained in any Contribution Document; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the Meritage Closing
occurs: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

other than in the case of fraud by a Party, the liability and indemnification
provisions of this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
of an Indemnified Party for any misrepresentation or breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant of the Indemnifying Party contained in
any Contribution Document; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

no misrepresentation or breach of a representation, warranty or covenant shall
give rise to any right on the part of any Party to rescind this Agreement,
any of the Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

neither KKR nor SemGroup shall have any liability to any Party or any Partys

- 77 \- 

       10.6 |

_Notice of Claim_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

In the event that a Party (the "Indemnified Party") becomes aware of any Claim
it or any of its Representatives or other related indemnified Persons may
have arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Contribution
Transaction (a "Indemnity Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give
notice thereof (a "Notice of Claim") to the other Party (the "Indemnifying
Party") from whom it is seeking indemnification hereunder. Such Notice of
Claim shall specify whether the Indemnity Claim arises as a result of a Claim
by a Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether
the Indemnity Claim does not so arise, and shall also specify with reasonable
particularity (to the extent that the information is available): (i) the
factual basis for the Indemnity Claim; and (ii) the amount of the Indemnity
Claim, if known. A failure to give prompt notice as provided in this Section
10.3 shall not affect the rights or obligations of any party except and only
to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party which was entitled
to receive such notice was directly prejudiced as a result of such failure,
including should it have been deprived of its right to recover any payment
under its applicable insurance coverage. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The obligations of an Indemnifying Party hereunder to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in respect of any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty are subject to and conditional upon the Indemnified
Party providing a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
this Section 10.3. 

---|---|--- 
 



   10.7 |

_Defence of Third Party Claims_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, at its expense, to participate in or assume control of the
negotiation, settlement or defence of the Indemnity Claim, provided that the
Indemnifying Party has acknowledged its Liability hereunder for the Indemnity
Claim and any Losses arising therefrom and has furnished such security or
other assurances as the Indemnified Party may reasonably request in connection
therewith, and provided further that any such negotiation, settlement or
defence is conducted in good faith and with due diligence, and, in such
event, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all of
the Indemnified Partys out-of-pocket expenses as a result of such
participation or assumption. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such
control, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
negotiation, settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim and to retain
counsel to act on its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying
Party consents to the retention of such counsel or unless the named parties to
any action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party and representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual
or potential differing interests between them (such as the availability of
different defences). 

---|---|--- 
 



- 78 \- 

         | (b) |

If the Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter
fails to defend the Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control, and the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.  

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.7, the Indemnified
Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to participate in or assume
control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of a Third Party Claim if: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the Indemnity Claim for indemnification involves or relates, directly or
indirectly and in any manner whatsoever, to any present material customer or
supplier of the Corporation; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Third Party Claim seeks any injunctive or other relief (other than
monetary damages) against the Indemnified Party, 

---|---|--- 

in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim but shall have
the right to participate in the negotiations, settlement or defence of such
Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf and at its
expense.

 



     | (d) |

If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party is
required by Applicable Laws to make a payment to any Person other than a
Party or a Partys Affiliates and its and their Related Persons (a "Third
Party") with respect to the Third Party Claim before the completion of
settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the Indemnified Party
may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall, forthwith after demand
by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

If the amount of any Liability of the Indemnified Party under the Third Party
Claim in respect of which such a payment was made, as finally determined, is
less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, forthwith after receipt of the
difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the
Indemnifying Party. 

---|---|--- 



   10.8 |

_Settlement of Third Party Claims_ 

---|--- 
 

Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the negotiation,
settlement or defence of any Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.7, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or pay any Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall consult and cooperate fully with each other on a
timely basis with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each other
fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant
documentation promptly as it becomes available). The Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party or its Representatives, on a timely
basis, all documents, records and other materials in the possession of the
Indemnified Party which are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for
its use in connection herewith, all at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party.

       10.9 |

_Reductions and Subrogation_ __ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

If the amount of Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party or any of its
Representatives or other related indemnified Persons at any time subsequent
to the making of an indemnity payment hereunder is actually reduced by any
recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage or under any
Claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person,
including under any manufacturers or other third party warranty, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
the reduction (less any costs, expenses (including Taxes) or
premiums incurred in connection therewith). For greater certainty, no
repayment by the Indemnified Party shall be required unless, and to the extent
that, the sum of the indemnity payment and the amount received from the Third
Party exceeds the total amount of Losses (which was required to be paid by
the Indemnified Party subject to the terms of this Agreement) to which the
indemnity payment relates. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Each Indemnified Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
recover the full amount available to it under any such recovery, settlement
or otherwise under any insurance coverage or under any Claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any other Person, including under any
manufacturers or other third party warranty. For certainty, the commercially
reasonable efforts of each of KKR and the Corporation pursuant to this Section
10.9(b) shall not include any efforts which, in its reasonable opinion, will
materially adversely impact its business. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

Upon making a full indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the
extent of that indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
indemnified Person against any Third Party in respect of the Losses to which
the indemnity payment relates, provided that until the Indemnified Party
recovers full payment of the Losses to which the indemnity payment relates,
any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such Third Party on
account of the indemnity payment are hereby expressly made subordinate and
subject in right of payment to the Indemnified Partys rights against such
Third Party. 

---|---|--- 



   10.10 |

_Payment and Interest_ 

---|--- 
 

All amounts to be paid by an Indemnifying Party under this Article 10 will
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate, calculated and
payable monthly, both before and after judgment, with interest on overdue
interest at the same rate, from the date that the Indemnified Party gave
notice of a Claim to the date of payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party.



   10.11 |

_No Double Recovery_ 

---|--- 
 

An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to double recovery for any Losses
even though the Losses may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, indemnities and covenants made or given by
the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement.

 



- 80 \- 

       10.12 |

_Net Benefit_ 

---|--- 
 

No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Section 10.12 in respect of
any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Person to the extent there are any
offsetting savings by or net financial benefits to such Indemnified Person
arising from such Losses or the facts, matters, events or circumstances giving
rise to such Losses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
in calculating the amount of any Losses indemnifiable hereunder, there shall
be deducted an amount equal to the amount of the Tax deduction or Tax credit,
as the case may be, multiplied by 5%.

 



   10.13 |

_Tax Gross Up_ 

---|--- 
 

If any indemnity payment hereunder is subject to Tax, the Indemnity Payment
shall be increased as may be necessary so that the relevant Indemnified Party
will receive a net amount (after deducting such Taxes) equal to the amount
otherwise payable under this Article 10\.



   10.14 |

_Treatment of Indemnification Payments_ 

---|--- 
 

To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Laws, for all purposes
(including tax purposes), the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment
made under this Article 10 by KKR or SemGroup to the Corporation in respect of
a misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty as an adjustment
to the purchase price paid by the Corporation in exchange for the
KKR Contribution or the SemGroup Contribution, respectively. For greater
certainty, the foregoing shall not result in any adjustment in the respective
equity interests of shareholders in the Corporation or the number of shares
issued to KKR or SemGroup in exchange for the KKR Contribution or the
SemGroup Contribution, respectively.
