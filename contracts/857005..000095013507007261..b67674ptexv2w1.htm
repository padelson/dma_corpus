4. Purchase Price and Payments 

  

4.1 _Enterprise Value and Share Purchase Price._  

   

       | (a)  |   | The enterprise value of the Consolidated Entities
(the "Enterprise Value") shall be calculated according to the following
formula:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | USD 249,750,000 (in words: two hundred forty-nine
million, seven hundred and fifty thousand US Dollars);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | minus  
   

   

(A) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital of the
Consolidated Entities according to the Final Closing Statements as of the
Closing Date is less than USD 7.0 million (in words: seven million US
Dollars); 

   

(B) the amount, if any, by which the Cash of the Consolidated Entities as

USD 5.0 million (in words: five million US Dollars) ("Required Cash"), but
only to the extent any shortfall of Cash has not already lead to a purchase
price adjustment pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii)(A) above (no double-
counting); 

  

       | (iii)  |   | plus  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

(C) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital of the
Consolidated Entities according to the Final Closing Statements as of the
Closing Date is in excess of USD 7.0 million (in words: seven million US
Dollars), 

   ##### 

  

  

       | (b)  |   | The share purchase price (the "Share Purchase
Price") shall be calculated according to the following formula:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Enterprise Value:  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | minus  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the Transaction Expenses;

    | (b)  |   | the SAR Expenses; and

4.2 _Estimated Share Purchase Price_. Not less than 5 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Sellers (acting through Sellers Agent) shall notify
Purchaser of Sellers good faith estimate of the Share Purchase Price (the
"Estimated Share Purchase Price") and provide Purchaser with a draft of
Sellers Closing Statements and other documentation which supports
Sellers calculation of the Estimated Share Purchase Price. Purchaser is
entitled to contest Sellers calculation. If the difference in the
calculation of Sellers and Purchaser is not exceeding USD 1,000,000 (in
words: one million U.S: Dollars), the difference shall be split in half, i.e.,
the Estimated Share Purchase Price shall be as estimated by Sellers minus 50
% of the difference in the calculations of Sellers and Purchaser. If the
difference in the calculations of Sellers and Purchaser exceeds USD 1,000,000
(in words: one million U.S. Dollars), Sellers and Purchaser shall endeavor to
achieve mutual agreement on the amount of the Estimated Share Purchase Price

of the Estimated Share Purchase Price one Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, the Closing of the transaction shall be suspended until the Parties do
so. Any agreement reached in that phase of the procedure does not
preclude either Party to request a subsequent adjustment pursuant to Section

4.3 _Escrow_. 

  

4.3.1 _Escrow Amount._ On the Closing Date, an amount equal to USD 25,000,000
(in words: twenty five million U.S. Dollars) (the "Escrow Amount") shall be
deposited by Purchaser in escrow at the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow
agreement essentially in the form attached as _Exhibit 4.3_ (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Amount shall serve for the satisfaction of any
claims by Purchaser under this Agreement against any, several or all Sellers
under this Agreement (except as otherwise explicitly set forth in the
Agreement) and provided that with respect to claims of Purchaser related to
the non-performance of the transfer of title by a Seller or claims related
to a Breach of Sellers representations and warranties in Section 1 and
Section 3.1 of Exhibit 7 only the Sellers Liability Portion of the Escrow
Amount of such breaching or non-performing Seller shall be available from the
Escrow Amount in respect of the respective Sellers _pro rata_  satisfaction
of the applicable Purchaser claim. It is hereby clarified that the Escrow
Amount includes a pro rata amount of USD 2,750,000 attributable to the SAR
participants. 

  

4.3.2 _Release of Escrow Amount._ The Escrow Amount in the then available
amount shall be released to the respective Sellers in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement by the following amounts as follows: 

    

(i) an amount of USD 12,500,000 (in words twelve million five hundred
thousand U.S. Dollars) shall be released on the date that is six months after
the Closing Date ("Escrow Period I"), except for (i) any amounts being under
negotiation or dispute pursuant to the procedure set forth below and (ii) any
amounts already released to the Sellers or the Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

    

based on a mutual settlement or final and binding ( _rechtskr aftig_) decision
of the competent court: 

   

Purchaser may provide Sellers Agent with a Purchaser Claim Notice or a Tax
Claim Notice within the Escrow Period I in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.1 and Section 8.7. In this case the relevant Parties shall first
attempt to negotiate a settlement of such claim. To the extent such
settlement is not reached within 30 days after receipt of such notification
by Sellers Agent, Purchaser shall have 60 additional days following
the expiration of the foregoing 30-day period to file an action (
_Klageerhebung_ ) against the relevant or all of the Seller(s). The action
can be served on the Process Agent. For the avoidance of doubt it is
clarified that Section 167 German Civil Procedure Code (
_Zivilprozessordnung_ , _ZPO_ ) shall apply. An amount equal to the amount in
dispute ( _Streitwert_ ) in such legal proceeding or, if such action is aimed
at a declaratory judgement ( _Feststellungsklage_ ), an amount equal to a
reasonable estimate of Purchaser regarding the volume of the claim shall not
be released until the legal proceeding has been decided, settled or dismissed
in a final and binding manner ( _rechtskr aftig_), unless otherwise
agreed between Sellers and Purchaser in writing. If Purchaser has not filed
an action within the aforementioned 60-day period and the Escrow Period I has
lapsed, the Sellers Agent and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
release immediately to the Sellers the full USD 12,500,000 except for any
amounts which have already been released or as otherwise agreed between the
Parties; 

   

(ii) any remaining amount shall be released on December 31, 2008 (the
period from the end of the Escrow Period I until December 31, 2008: "Escrow
Period II") except for (x) any amounts being under negotiation or dispute
pursuant to the procedure set forth in lit. (i) above or this lit. (ii) below
and (y) any amounts already released to the Sellers or the Purchaser based on
a mutual settlement or final and binding ( _rechtskr aftig_) decision of the
competent court: 

   

Purchaser may provide Sellers Agent with a Purchaser Claim Notice or a Tax
Claim Notice within the Escrow Period II in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.1 and Section 8.7. In this case the relevant Parties shall first
attempt to negotiate a settlement of such claim. To the extent such
settlement is not reached within 30 days after receipt of such notification
by Sellers Agent, Purchaser shall have 60 additional days following
the expiration of the foregoing 30-day period to file an action (
_Klageerhebung_ ) against the relevant Sellers. The action can be served on
the Process Agent. For the avoidance of doubt it is clarified that Section
167 German Civil Procedure Code ( _Zivilprozessordnung_ , _ZPO_ ) shall
apply. An amount equal to the amount in dispute ( _Streitwert_ ) in such legal
proceeding or, if such action is aimed at a declaratory judgement (
_Feststellungsklage_ ), an amount equal to a reasonable estimate of Purchaser
regarding the volume of the claim shall not be released until the legal
proceeding has been decided, settled or dismissed in a final and binding
manner ( _rechtskr aftig_) unless otherwise agreed between Sellers and
Purchaser in writing. If Purchaser has not filed an action within the
aforementioned 60-day period and the Escrow Period II has lapsed, the
Sellers Agent and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
immediately to the Sellers the full residual amount of the Escrow Amount for
which no suspension is permitted. 

   

(iii) In the event that Purchaser has filed a declaratory action (
_Feststellungklage_ ) and Purchasers reasonable estimate regarding the
volume of the claim turns out to be incorrect by more than 20 %, Purchaser
shall be obliged to pay interest (over and above any interest accruing on
such Escrow Amount in the Escrow account) at a rate of 5 % per annum on
any amount by which the actual damage claims finally awarded to Purchaser are
less than Purchasers estimate for the period from the date when the relevant
amount would otherwise 

   ##### 

  

    

have been released from the Escrow Account until to the date when Sellers are
entitled to request release of such amount under the Escrow Agreement. 

 

4.4 _Sellers Closing Payment_. Purchaser shall pay to Sellers at the
Closing an amount equal to the Estimated Share Purchase Price minus the
Escrow Amount ("Sellers Closing Payment"). Sellers Closing Payment shall be
split between Sellers as follows: 

  

       |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    
     | Seller  |   |   | Split in Percentage  |   |   |
Definition  |   
        |

  |   |   | 95.0783   |   |   | "Seller 1 Closing Payment"  |   
     |

Seller 2 

  |   |   | 4.772558   |   |   | "Seller 2 Closing Payment"  |   
     |

Seller 3 

  |   |   | 0.149142   |   |   | "Seller 3 Closing Payment"  |   
     
    

  

     4.5  |   | _Payments on Closing_. Purchaser shall make the
following payments at the Closing (collectively, the "Closing Payments"):  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | to Seller 1 the amount of Seller 1 Closing
Payment by wire transfer of funds to such account as shall be designated by
Seller 1 to Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | to Seller 2 the amount of Seller 2 Closing Payment by
wire transfer of funds to such account as shall be designated by Seller 2 to
Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | to Seller 3 the amount of Seller 3 Closing Payment by
wire transfer of funds to such account as shall be designated by Seller 3 to
Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | to the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the Escrow
Amount;  
      
    | (v)  |   | to the account identified by the Agent under the Credit
Facilities in the Pay-Off Notice the amount of the Company Debt Obligations
under the Credit Facilities as specified by Sellers Agent prior to Closing
(being the amount considered between the Parties for the calculation of the
Estimated Share Purchase Price);  
      
    | (vi)  |   | to the service providers and other persons to whom
Transaction Expenses are owed, such amounts as identified by Seller Agent to
Purchaser prior to the Closing;  
      
    | (vii)  |   | to the Company the amount equal to the SAR Expenses
by wire transfer of funds to such account as shall be designated by the
Company to Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date
which account will be utilized by the Company to pay such SAR Expenses (net
of the portion of the Escrow Amount of USD 2,750,000 attributable to the SAR
participants previously funded under clause (iv) above).  
   

   

For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and the Company shall use best efforts
to avoid payment of Transaction Expenses not being tax deductible for the
Company by allocating the respective Transaction Expenses to the Sellers. 

   

There shall be no double counting of the same line items in the determination
of Purchase Price calculation elements such as Cash, Company Debt
Obligations, Working Capital etc. 

   ##### 

  

 

4.6 _Final Share Purchase Price_. The Share Purchase Price calculated on
the basis of the numbers set forth in the Final Closing Statements is
hereinafter referred to as the "Final Share Purchase Price". 

   

5. Closing Statements 

  

5.1 _Preparation of Closing Statements_. The consolidated balance sheet of
the Consolidated Entities as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Statements")
shall be prepared in compliance with US-GAAP as applied by the Company in the
consolidated US-GAAP accounts for the Company as at 31 October 2006 (relating
to the former CoCreate Software GmbH (old), registered at the Local Court

dispute pursuant to Sections 5.3 and 5.4. 

  

5.3 _Objections of Purchaser_. If Purchaser believes that Sellers Closing
Statements are incorrect or have not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Agreement, Purchaser shall inform Sellers in writing

submitted Closing Statements. If and to the extent that Sellers and Purchaser

oral hearing. The costs of the Expert shall be borne pursuant to the
principles set forth in Sections 91 et. seq. German Civil Procedure Code (

party, as determined by the Expert.

contentious matters amongst themselves; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | -  |   | the day on which the Expert delivers his decision

date of actual payment, shall be due and payable ten Business Days after the
Final Closing Statements shall have become binding on the Parties pursuant to

payable under this Section 5.6 ("Downward Adjustment") to Purchaser.

(other than the Mutual Closing Condition set forth in Section 6.1.3(ii)) has
neither been fulfilled nor duly waived (if waiver is permitted) within sixty

  (vi)  |   | The parties may withdraw from this Agreement upon the mutual
written consent of the Sellers and Purchaser.

7. Representations and Warranties of Sellers 

  

7.1 _Representations and Warranties._ Sellers as several and not joint
debtors hereby represent and warrant to Purchaser by way of an independent
guarantee ( _unabh angiges Garantieversprechen_) within the meaning of
Section 311(1) of the German Civil Code (BGB) that the statements set forth
in _Exhibit 7_ are true, complete and complied with on the Signing Date and
will be true, complete and complied with on the Closing Date (except as
expressly stated otherwise hereinafter or in Exhibit 7). 

  

7.2 _Sellers  Best Knowledge_. If and to the extent any of the
representations or warranties of Sellers in Exhibit 7 are made to "Sellers
Best Knowledge", such representation or warranty is only breached if any
Seller hereto or any of the Knowledge Employees had actual knowledge of
the relevant fact, provided however that Michaela Haitz knowledge shall only
be relevant with respect to the representations and warranties in Section 7
and Section 9 of Exhibit 7 hereto. 

   

8. Remedies 

  

8.1 _Breach_. Subject to Sections 9 and 18.11 hereof, in the event that any
of the representations or warranties of Sellers contained herein or in
Exhibit 7 is untrue, incorrect or not complied with, or the Company or
Sellers fail to comply with any of its covenants or other obligations under
this Agreement (a "Breach"), Sellers shall be liable to pay to
Purchaser compensation in money ( _Schadensersatz in Geld_ ) for any Losses
suffered by Purchaser or any of the Consolidated Entities which would not
exist if such representation or warranty were true, complete or complied
with, or such covenant was complied with. 

  

Purchaser shall notify Sellers Agent in writing without any undue delay but
no later than one month after having obtained knowledge of all relevant facts
giving rise to the alleged Purchasers claim pursuant to this Section 8.1
("Purchaser Claim Notice"). The Purchaser Claim Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the factual and legal basis of the claim and the amount
claimed, being a reasonable estimate of the damages recoverable in accordance
with this Agreement. 

  

8.2 _Indemnification regarding Taxes_. Subject to Section 9 (except for
Section 9.2), Sellers agree to pay to Purchaser or, at the election of
Purchaser, the Consolidated Entities (collectively the "Beneficiaries") an
amount equal to any liability for Taxes, which are due and payable by
the Consolidated Entities (i) for all periods prior to and including the
Closing Date or (ii) for periods after the Closing Date, but in the case of
(ii) only if and to the extent such Taxes are triggered as a result of the
Consolidated Entities having failed to make any deductions or withholdings in
respect, or on account, of Tax from any payments which the Consolidated
Entities have made until and including the Closing Date, in each case of (i)
and (ii) unless, and except to the extent that: 

    ##### 

  

  

       | (i)  |   | the respective Tax liability is identifiably
taken into account as liability or provision in the Final Closing Statements
or as current Liability in calculating the Working Capital;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | such Tax liability is subject of a valid and
enforceable claim for repayment or indemnification against a third party
(other than a Tax authority), except to the extent such valid and enforceable
claim despite the reasonable efforts of the Purchaser or Consolidated
Entities cannot be recovered from such third party at the earlier of (i)
three (3) months following the date on which repayment or indemnification
against such third party has been claimed for the first time and (ii)
December 30, 2008, and provided that any non-recoverable (or not timely
recoverable) portions of claims against a third party that are assignable
without requiring the consent of such third party are assigned to the Sellers
after the expiration of the aforementioned dates;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | such Tax liability is the result of any change in the
established accounting and taxation principles or practices of the
Consolidated Entities (including methods for submitting Tax returns)
introduced after the Closing Date, unless any such changes are necessary to
align the accounting and taxation principles or practices to mandatory law in
force on the Closing Date or proposed mandatory law that was introduced
in Parliament as draft legislation on or before the Closing Date; it being
understood that this subclause (iii) does not apply to the preparation of a
transfer price study/documentation by any Beneficiary after the Closing Date,
to the extent such study/documentation may have retroactive effect;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | such Tax liability is the result of any transaction,
action or omission (including but not limited to the change in the exercise
of any Tax election right, the termination of any consolidation scheme, the
approval or implementation of any reorganisation or other measures or the
sale of any assets) initiated by any of the Beneficiaries after the Closing
Date, unless any such transactions, actions, omissions or other measures are
compelled by mandatory law in force on the Closing Date or proposed mandatory
law that was introduced in Parliament as draft legislation on or before the
Closing Date; the final clause of subclause (iii) applies accordingly;  
      
    | (v)  |   | any of the Consolidated Entities  
   

  

       | (x)  |   | have received before December 31, 2008 a refund
or reduction of Taxes for periods ending on or before the Closing Date either
in cash, by way of set-off, deduction or otherwise, except where the
respective Tax refunds have been recognised as a claim in the Final Closing
Statements, or may before December 31, 2008 dissolve any unused Tax provision
as a result of a final and non-appealable ( _formell und materiell bestandskr
aftig_) decision by a Tax authority which is not subject to any changes, or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (y)  |   | have received before December 31, 2008 (either in cash,
by way of set-off, deduction or otherwise)]any benefits by refund, set-off or
reduction of Taxes arising after the Closing Date out of the circumstance
triggering the indemnification claim, e.g. (without limitation) resulting
from the lengthening of amortization or depreciation periods, higher
depreciation allowances, a step-up in the Tax basis of depreciable assets or
the non-recognition of liabilities or provisions ( _Phasenverschiebung_ ),
whereby the calculation period for such Tax reductions shall be limited to
December 31, 2008 and the amount of the reductions of Taxes shall be
discounted at 6% p.a. to the date when the indemnification payment by the
Sellers is due pursuant to Section 8.7.  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (vi)  |   | the procedures pursuant to Sections 8.6 were not
observed by Purchaser, unless the Tax underlying the Purchasers payment
would also have arisen had the Purchaser complied with such procedure.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

8.2a _No artificial triggering of early Tax audit_. Purchaser will abstain
from, and will ensure that the Consolidated Entities will abstain from,
applying or artificially triggering or artificially extending a Tax audit of
the Consolidated entities or the Purchaser during the Escrow Period I or the
Escrow Period II which otherwise would take place after the expiration of
that period. For the avoidance of doubt this shall not prevent Purchaser or
the Consolidated Entities to make their regular Tax filings as required under
applicable Tax laws. 

  

8.3 _Allocation._ For purpose of determining Tax indemnifications or
warranties regarding the fiscal year 2007/2008, the allocation of Taxes of
the Consolidated Entities between Sellers (Taxes relating to periods before
and including the Closing Date) and Purchaser (Taxes relating to
periods after the Closing Date) shall be calculated as follows: With regard
to taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date, the portion of Taxes related to the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be imposed on
or refunded to the respective entity, if the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. 

  

8.4 _Tax Losses arising after Closing Date._ Any losses or other reductions
of the Tax assessment basis arising in any period after the Closing Date,
which are carried back into any period ending on or before the Closing Date
shall not be taken into account in determining Tax indemnifications and
allocations for purposes of Sections 8.2 and 8.3. 

  

8.5 _Procedure for Defending Third Party Claims_. Purchaser shall without
undue delay give notice to Sellers Agent of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding and further matters (excluding any preparation and filing of Tax
returns), (announcement of any) audits, examinations, investigations, dispute
or appeal or similar proceedings or any other material communication by/with
Tax, environmental or other governmental authorities) brought by a third party
in respect of which Purchaser may claim damages hereunder (a "Third Party
Claim"). At the reasonable request of Sellers, Purchaser shall promptly (i)
make available to Sellers Agent a copy of the documents substantiating the
Third Party Claim and of all documents relating to the Third Party
Claim (including, without limitation, copies of books, records and
documentation of the Beneficiaries which can reasonably be expected to have
relevance for the Third Party Claim, and (ii) give Sellers (through Sellers
Agent) the opportunity to defend such claim, provided that Sellers accept
to reimburse the Beneficiaries for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Sellers shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim by all
reasonably appropriate proceedings and shall have after due prior
consultation with Purchaser the power to direct and control such defense,
provided that such defense does not affect material interests of the
Beneficiaries and provided that Sellers fully comply with their obligations
under this Section 8.5. Purchaser and counsel appointed by Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate in the proceedings including any meetings and
discussions with the respective third party or its advisors. Sellers Agent
shall keep Purchaser at all times fully informed about the proceedings.
Sellers shall conduct such proceedings in good faith using best endeavors to
take the interests of the Beneficiaries into account. In no event shall
Sellers be entitled to acknowledge or settle a claim or permit any such
acknowledgement or settlement without Purchasers prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser and other Beneficiaries
shall cooperate with Sellers Agent in the defense of any Third Party Claim,
provide Sellers Agent and Sellers advisors access, during normal business
hours, to all relevant business records and documents which can reasonably be
expected to have relevance for the Third Party Claim. All costs and expenses
incurred in defending any Third Party Claim by Sellers shall be borne
by Sellers. Any failure of Purchaser to comply with obligations set forth in
this Section 8.5 shall reduce Purchasers claims based on the principles of
Section 254 of the German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ), to the extent that 

  ##### 

  

   

Sellers position in the proceedings underlying the Third Party Claim was
materially impaired by such failure of Purchaser. 

  

8.6 _Procedure in relation to Tax filings._ Sellers Agent shall file (or
cause the Consolidated Entities to file) all Tax returns which are due or
otherwise required to be filed by or on behalf of the Consolidated Entities
for time periods ending on or before the Closing Date. In this respect,
Sellers are obliged to timely file (and shall see to it that the Company also
files) the application on the down-stream merger of former Neckarsee 88. V V
GmbH (formerly registered in the commercial register of the local court of
Stuttgart under HRB 720596) into former CoCreate Software GmbH (formerly
registered with the commercial register of the local court of Stuttgart under
HRB 245058) in accordance with annot. 11.24 of the circular of the Federal
Ministry of Finance of 25 March 1998 on the Reorganisation Tax Act 1995
(BStBl. I 1998, p. 268). Sellers shall have the right to review and comment
(through Sellers Agent) on any Tax return to be filed by the Consolidated
Entities relating to a period beginning before the Closing Date, but only and
insofar as any period having ended on or before the Closing Date is
concerned. Purchaser shall provide copies of any such Tax return to Sellers
Agent no later than twenty (20) days prior to the relevant due date of such
Tax return. Sellers right to review shall expire if the Taxes to be assessed
in connection with the Tax returns to be filed are no longer subject to the
Sellers indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 8.2. The Sellers
undertake to co-operate with and assist Purchaser and the Consolidated
Entities in preparing Tax filings after the Closing Date for periods prior to
and including the Closing Date. This also applies to periods beginning and
ending after the Closing Date to the extent that the relevant Tax filings
cannot accurately be filed without Sellers` knowledge and provided that
Purchaser reimburses Sellers for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. This
Section 8.6 shall only apply in respect of Tax returns which are to be filed
on an annual basis. 

  

8.7 _Tax Claim Notice._ Indemnification payments by Sellers under Section
8.2 in respect of claims thereunder shall be due ten (10) Business Days
following a notice ("Tax Claim Notice") (together with a written explanation
of the background of the claim and a copy of the respective Tax payment
order, unless such information was already provided to the Sellers Agent in
accordance with Section 8.5) by Purchaser to Sellers Agent, provided that
any payment shall be made from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.3 and the Escrow Agreement. 

  

8.8 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. The Parties agree that the
remedies which Purchaser, or any Consolidated Companies, may have against
Sellers for a Breach, an alleged Breach or an indemnification regarding Taxes
pursuant to Section 8.2 above or for any other Breach of obligations set
forth in the Agreement are solely governed by the Agreement, and the
remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies
available to Purchaser or the Consolidated Companies. The Parties further
agree that representations and warranties are no quality guarantees regarding
the object of purchase within the meaning of Sections 276, 443 and 444 BGB (
_Garantie f ur die Beschaffenheit der Sache_). Any right of Purchaser (i) to
withdraw ( _zur ucktreten_) from this Agreement (unless explicitly stated
otherwise in the Agreement) or to require the winding up of the transaction
contemplated hereunder (e.g. by way of _gro ßer Schadensersatz _or
_Schadenersatz statt der Leistung_ ), (ii) any claims for breach of pre-
contractual obligations ( _culpa in contrahendo,_ including claims arising
under Sections 241 Subsec. 2, 311 Subsec. 2 (3) German Civil Code) or
ancillary obligations ( _positive Forderungsverletzung,_ including claims
arising under Sections 280, 282 German Civil Code), (iii) frustration of
contract pursuant to Section 313 German Civil Code ( _St orung der
Geschaftsgrundlage_), (iv) all remedies of Purchaser for defects pursuant to
Sections 437 through 441 German Civil Code and (v) any and all
other statutory rights and remedies, if any, are hereby expressly excluded
and waived by Purchaser, except for claims for wilful deceit ( _arglistige T
auschung_) and other intentional breach of contract ( _vors atzliche
Vertragsverletzungen_). In furtherance of the foregoing, except for
the representations and warranties contained in Exhibit 7 as 

  ##### 

  

   

well as the remedies for the indemnification regarding Taxes and all other
claims of Purchaser expressly set forth in the Agreement and the scope of
which is not limited by this Section 8.8, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that none of Sellers will be subject to any liability to Purchaser for any
projection or forecast, statement or information (other than set forth in
any representation and warranty contained in Exhibit 7) made, communicated,
or furnished (orally or in writing) to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
representatives, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf
of the Sellers or the Consolidated Entities relating to the
Consolidated Entities or data room information provided to Purchaser of its
Affiliates or representatives, or any other document or information in any
form provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives in connection
with the sale of the Shares and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
exclusion of Sellers liability shall not apply in the event of fraud or
wilful misconduct ( _Arglist oder Vorsatz_ ). 

  

8.9 _No Double Counting._ No claim of Purchaser under this Agreement may be
indemnified or otherwise remedied more than once in respect of the same loss
suffered. 

  

8.10 _Reduction or Increase of Share Purchase Price_. All payments made by the
Sellers to Purchaser or, at the election of Purchaser, the Consolidated
Entities, or Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8 shall
constitute a reduction or an increase of the Share Purchase Price, as the
case may be. 

   

9. Limitations to Sellers Liability for a Breach 

  

9.1 _Liability Cap_. The aggregate liability of Sellers on account of a
Breach and in respect of indemnification for Taxes pursuant to Section 8.2
shall be limited, subject to Section 9.4 below, to the Escrow Amount in the
amount available on the Escrow account (the "Liability Cap") and, for the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall, subject to Section 9.4 below, only be
entitled to claim payment from the Escrow Amount in the amount available on
the Escrow account. 

  

9.2 _Thresholds._ A liability of Sellers on account of a Breach shall arise
only to the extent that any individual claim or a series of substantially
similar claims exceeds USD 20,000 (in words twenty thousand U.S. Dollars) and
only if and to the extent that the sum of all such claims exceeds USD
1,500,000 (in words one million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) whereby
amounts in excess of USD 500,000 can be claimed on a dollar for dollar basis
once the thresholds are reached ( _Freigrenzen_ ). This Section 9.2 shall not
apply to indemnification claims of Purchaser resulting from Section 8.2
above. 

  

9.3 _Time Limitations_. Subject to Section 9.4 below, any claims of
Purchaser under or in connection with this Agreement shall become time barred
on December 31, 2008 (the "Time Cap"). 

  

9.4 _Exclusions_. Except for Section 18.11 and Section 9.5, none of the
limitations to Sellers liability under this Agreement (including without
limitation in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3) shall apply to (a) Sellers
obligation to transfer title to the Shares ( _wirksame Übertragung
von Geschaftsanteilen als vertragliche Hauptleistungspflicht_) and (b) any
damage claims resulting from the non-performance of the foregoing obligation
to transfer title to the Shares (whereby, for the avoidance of doubt,
remedies of Purchaser for defects in the purchased business shall
remain subject to the limitations to Sellers liability under this Section 9,
except for representations and warranties set forth under Section 9.4 (e)
below) and (c) in the event of fraud or willful misconduct ( _Arglist oder
Vorsatz_ ) of Sellers or the Company and (d) claims under Section
5.6 (Downward Adjustment of Share Purchase Price) and (e) claims directly or
indirectly relating to representations or warranties in Sections 1, 3.1, 3.2
and 3.5 of Exhibit 7 of this Agreement as well as (f) the covenants in
Section 11.1, 12.2 and Section 14 (Confidentiality) of this
Agreement ("Excluded Claims"). Purchaser shall be obliged to first discharge
any of its Excluded Claims referenced in clause (e) and (f) above, 

  ##### 

  

   

however, as regards clause (f), not in respect to the covenants under Section
11.1.1, from a drawdown of amounts from the Escrow Amount and, in case
amounts out of the Escrow Amount are released to Purchaser in discharge of
any of the Excluded Claims referenced in clause (e) and (f) above, however,
as regards clause (f), not in respect to the covenants under Section 11.1.1,
the Liability Cap shall be reduced by the amount of such release as described

under or in connection with this Agreement and Sellers shall not be liable if
and to the extent:

forming the basis of the claim have been disclosed to Purchaser in this
Agreement, or any Exhibits/Schedules to this Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the respective damage/claim has been reflected as a
reserve or provision made for the relevant risk in the Final Closing
Statements;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | Purchaser fails to inform Sellers in writing without
undue delay, however, no later than one (1) month after becoming aware of a
Breach, or fails to use all reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate its
damages pursuant to Section 254 of the German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ), provided
that in case of a late notification by Purchaser, Purchasers claim shall be
reduced in accordance with the principles of Section 254 of the German Civil
Code ( _BGB_ ) only to the extent the damage was increased by such
late notification;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | the damage results from or is increased by the passing
of, or any change in, any law, rule, regulation or administrative practice of

    | (vi)  |   | such claim is for loss of future revenue, income or
profits, or loss of business reputation or opportunity or compensation of any
internal costs or any arguments that the purchase price was calculated by
applying certain multiples relating to the Breach or alleged Breach hereof.  
      
    | (vii)  |   | a corresponding collectible (i. e. valuable and
enforceable) payment claim of any of the Consolidated Entities or the
Purchaser against an insurance company exists; provided that if Purchaser has

otherwise acknowledged responsibility for such claim in writing, in each case
at least five Business Days prior to the release of any Escrow Amounts at  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | the expiration of Escrow Period I or Escrow Period II,
as applicable, Purchaser shall be entitled to submit a Purchaser Claim in
respect of the claim for which the corresponding collectible payment claim
against an insurance company exists and the amount subject to such claim (or
a reasonable estimate thereof in the case the amount is not determinable at
such time) shall continue to be held in escrow, without regard, except as
provided in clause (ii) below, to the 30 and 60-day procedures set forth in
Section 4.3.2(i) and (ii) until (i) the Company collects the
insurance proceeds related to such claim, or the insurance company otherwise
acknowledges responsibility in writing for such claim, in which case the
Purchaser and the Sellers Agent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
the amount held in escrow in respect of such claim (to the extent collected
from or acknowledged by the insurance company) to the Sellers or (ii) if the
insurance company finally refuses to pay the amount of such claim, until the
claim for which the Purchaser is seeking indemnification is finally resolved
as between the Sellers and the Purchaser utilizing the 30 and 60-day
procedures set forth in Section 4.3.2(i) and (ii), as applicable, in which
case the amount held in escrow in respect of such claim shall be released to
the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case may be, in accordance with
such Sections 4.3.2(i) and (ii), as applicable, and the Escrow Agreement.  
---|---|---|---

the Sellers  transfer the Third Party Compensation Claim to the Sellers to
the extent that the Third Party Compensation Claim is assignable or, if the
Third Party Compensation Claim is not assignable, Purchaser or the
Consolidated Entities shall pursue the Third Party Compensation Claim on
behalf and on the costs of Sellers to be advanced by Sellers to Purchaser in
a reasonable amount upon Purchasers request.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.8  |   | _Exclusion of Section 442 BGB._ It is hereby agreed between

granted by Purchaser to any member of the management of the Company or any of
the Consolidated Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement. The foregoing shall not apply to severance payments, if

     10.2  |   | _Indemnification_. In the event that Purchaser is in
breach of any representation and warranty under Section 10.1 or fails to

by Purchaser in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld):  
---|---|--- 
   

   

 (i) _Access_. Any Consolidated Entity shall afford to Purchaser, its authorized representatives, and the authorized representatives of Purchasers prospective lenders and advisors access reasonably required during normal business hours, upon due prior notice, to all directors, officers, key management and other representatives, properties, books, records, contracts and documents of the Consolidated Entities and an opportunity to make such investigations as they shall reasonably desire to make of a Consolidated Entity (provided that such investigations shall be conducted so as to minimize any disruption of the operations of such Consolidated Entity), and the Consolidated Entities shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser and its authorized representatives all such information with respect to the affairs and business of the Consolidated Entities as Purchaser may reasonably request.

Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be deemed to require the Company or Purchaser to cause to be continued any employees employment or benefits for any specific period. 

 

11.2 _Access to Information_. Purchaser shall procure that after the
Closing Date upon reasonable prior notice Sellers and its representatives are
given reasonable access during regular business hours of the Company to, and
Sellers shall be entitled to make copies of such information that Sellers

condition, results of operations or prospects. 

   

12. Transition of Business 

  

12.1 _General Cooperation_. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide for a smooth transition of the

effect as of the Closing Date. The termination shall be made without any costs
for any of the Consolidated Entities and with full release of the
Consolidated Entities from any liability under the respective agreements to
Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates. Sellers undertake towards Purchaser
that, except as set forth in this Agreement, as from the Signing Date neither
of the Sellers nor any of Sellers Affiliates have any claim whatsoever
against any of the Consolidated Entities or any of their respective Directors
and Officers or employees, and the Consolidated Entities will not have any
liability towards any of the Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates except as

to be confused with the word "CoCreate" or such trademark or trade-name,
except for the use for press and marketing purposes of HBK and its Affiliates
and related funds. 

   

13. Indemnity 

  

If, after the Closing Date, any Seller or any of the Consolidated Entities
officers, directors, agents or other representatives listed in Exhibit 13/1
(collectively, the "Sellers Beneficiaries") are held liable for any existing
or future (known or unknown, actual or contingent, accrued or unaccrued)
liability or obligation of the Consolidated Entities or arising out of, or in
connection with, the conduct of the Business (collectively, the "Business
Obligations"), then Purchaser shall ensure that the existing indemnification
agreements (the "Indemnity Agreements") between any of the Sellers
Beneficiaries and any of the Consolidated Entities as listed in Exhibit 13/2
shall be honored by the Consolidated Entities ( _Vertrag zugunsten Dritter_
), whereby Sellers undertake to ensure that Sellers Beneficiaries shall not
raise any claims under the Indemnity Agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder. In addition, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause the Con- 

  ##### 

  

   

solidated Entities after the Closing not to, terminate, amend, modify or
cancel the Indemnity Agreements without the written consent of the Sellers
Beneficiaries ( _Vertrag zugunsten Dritter_ ). The Company shall, at or prior
to Closing, purchase a three (3) year "tail" to its directors and officers
liability policy covering the Sellers Beneficiaries (and the other directors,
officers, employees, agents, and other representatives of the Company covered
by the Companys existing directors and officers liability policy).

or press release, whichever occurs first, the fact that a Closing
is anticipated or has occurred shall be held in confidence by the
Consolidated Entities, the Sellers, and HBK and its Affiliates. After the
time of any such filing or press release, whichever occurs first, the fact

Affiliates.  
      
    | 14.1.3  |   | Any press release or public disclosure by any

or otherwise with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
provided to Guarantor for its review in advance of its release.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any press release or public disclosure by
such persons need not be provided to Guarantor for its review if such press
release or public disclosure contains no material information beyond that
which has been disclosed previously by such persons in a press release or
public disclosure that Guarantor had the opportunity to review.  
      
    | 14.1.4  |   | In advance of the Closing, to the extent permissible
by law, Sellers, Purchaser and Guarantor shall work together to develop the
communications and disclosures to be made to the employees of Consolidated
Entities, and, if necessary, customers and suppliers relating to the
Consolidated Entities.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | 14.1.5  |   | Purchaser shall not, without the prior written

business or trade secrets of the Consolidated Entities, unless it becomes
public knowledge through no fault of Sellers or is required to be disclosed by
Sellers pursuant to law, or judicial or official order, in which event

in money (Schadensersatz in Geld) for Losses suffered by any of the

or all of the lenders under the Credit Facilities in respect of any
obligations (including indemnification obligations) of the Consolidated
Entities thereunder notwithstanding the repayment of the Credit Facilities

Purchaser shall provide notice of any Purchaser CF Indemnification Claims
to Sellers  Agent in the same manner and within the same time periods as set

apply with respect to any such Purchaser CF Indemnification Claims. For the
avoidance of doubt, the release of the Escrow Amount at the end of Escrow
Period I and Escrow Period II in the then available amount in accordance with
Section 4.3.2 shall not be affected if no Purchaser CF Indemnification Claims
have been notified to Sellers Agent within Escrow Period I (in relation to a

after Escrow Period II)."_

amount available on the Escrow account (the "_ _Liability Cap_ _") and, for
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall, subject to Section 9.4 below, only
be entitled to claim payment from the Escrow Amount in the amount
available on the Escrow account."_
