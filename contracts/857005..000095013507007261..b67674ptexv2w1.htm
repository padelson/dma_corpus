shall inform Sellers in writing (&#147;<B>Objection Notice</B>&#148;) within 30 Business Days of Purchaser&#146;s receipt

Sellers&#146; Closing Statements pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.3, then Sellers and Purchaser shall endeavour to
resolve the disputed items by mutual agreement. If Sellers and Purchaser reach agreement, the
revised Closing Statements, as varied by such agreement, shall replace the previously submitted
Closing Statements. If and to the extent that Sellers and Purchaser fail to reach agreement within
20 Business Days after receipt by Sellers of the Objection Notice, Sellers and Purchaser shall have
the right to refer the matter to Deloitte &#038; Touche, Munich which, acting as expert
(<I>Schiedsgutachter</I>) (the &#147;<B>Expert</B>&#148;), shall resolve the items still in dispute. The items determined
by the Expert may not be above or below the figures proposed by Sellers and Purchaser. The Expert
shall, taking account of any matters already agreed by Sellers and Purchaser, also determine the
changes (if any) to be made to the Closing Statements, which as so changed, shall replace the
previously submitted Closing Statements. The Parties shall instruct the Expert to complete its
review and determination within 20 Business Days of commencing such review. Sellers and Purchaser
shall be given the opportunity to present their views in English in writing and at least one oral
hearing. The costs of the Expert shall be borne pursuant to the principles set forth in Sections
91 et. seq. German Civil Procedure Code (<I>Zivilprozessordnung</I>) in the ratio of the respective
winning and losing party, as determined by the Expert.

under HRB 245058) in accordance with annot. 11.24 of the circular of the Federal Ministry of
Finance of 25 March&nbsp;1998 on the Reorganisation Tax Act 1995 (BStBl. I 1998, p. 268). Sellers shall
have the right to review and comment (through Sellers&#146; Agent) on any Tax return to be filed by the
Consolidated Entities relating to a period beginning before the Closing Date, but only and insofar
as any period having ended on or before the Closing Date is concerned. Purchaser shall provide
copies of any such Tax return to Sellers&#146; Agent no later than twenty (20)&nbsp;days prior to the
relevant due date of such Tax return. Sellers right to review shall expire if the Taxes to be
assessed in connection with the Tax returns to be filed are no longer subject to the Sellers&#146;
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2. The Sellers undertake to co-operate with and
assist Purchaser and the Consolidated Entities in preparing Tax filings after the Closing Date for
periods prior to and including the Closing Date. This also applies to periods beginning and ending
after the Closing Date to the extent that the relevant Tax filings cannot accurately be filed
without Sellers&#096; knowledge and provided that Purchaser reimburses Sellers for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. This Section&nbsp;8.6 shall only apply in respect of Tax returns which are to be
filed on an annual basis.
