the resolution of the disputed items, shall thereupon become final and
binding. The fees and expenses of any such arbitration (including the fees
and expenses of the accounting firm named above) under this Section 2.4(c)
shall be borne 50% by the SN Parties and 50% by Buyer, regardless of the
outcome  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t11  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tof any such arbitration. The Parties agree that any disputed item
related to the application or interpretation of Applicable Law or other
provisions of this Agreement shall not be resolved by the designated
accounting firm, but shall instead be resolved pursuant to the other
provisions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.4 exceeds the estimated Purchase Price as set forth on the
Proposed Closing Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller cash in the amount of
such excess. If the estimated Purchase Price as set forth on the Proposed
Closing Statement exceeds the Purchase Price as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.4, the SN Parties shall pay to Buyer (or its
designee(s)) cash in the amount of such excess. After giving effect to the
foregoing adjustments, any amount to be paid by Buyer to Seller, or to be paid
by the SN Parties to Buyer, as the case may be, shall be paid in the manner as
provided in Section 2.4(e) within five Business Days after Buyer's acceptance
of the Closing Statement or the resolution of Buyer's objections thereto
pursuant to Section 2.4(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Any cash payments pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be made by
causing such payments to be credited in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, as may be
designated by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, by notice to the other
Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and review of the Closing Statement, and none
of such costs or expenses shall be taken into account in the determination of
the Purchase Price (or any component thereof) pursuant to this Section
2.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Parties acknowledge and agree that any inaccuracies, omissions,
mischaracterizations or similar errors contained in the Proposed Closing
Statement or the Closing Statement shall not be subject to any "deductible,"
including the deductibles provided in Section 11.4(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Parties agree to treat
the purchase of the Interests as the purchase of all the assets of the Company
by Buyer for U.S. federal income tax purposes and agree to allocate the
Purchase Price among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code. Not later than 90 days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
the SN Parties a statement, allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of
the Company ("Allocation Statement"). The SN Parties shall have 30 days to
review and notify Buyer in writing of any reasonable, good faith disagreement
with the Allocation Statement. If the SN Parties do not timely notify Buyer
of any such disagreement with the Allocation Statement, the SN Parties shall
be conclusively deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Allocation
Statement. If the SN Parties notify Buyer within 30 days of any such
disagreement, the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute
within 30 days. In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve such
dispute within 30 days, the Parties shall retain a mutually agreeable,
nationally recognized accounting firm (that does not have a material
relationship with any of the Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates)
(the "Tax Allocation Referee") to resolve the disputed items. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Parties (and the Tax Allocation Referee,
if applicable) shall resolve all disputed items no later than 30 days after
retaining the Tax Allocation Referee. Upon resolution of the disputed items,
the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to
reflect such resolution. The fees and expenses payable to the Tax  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t12  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAllocation Referee shall be split equally between Buyer and the SN
Parties. The Parties agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and
(ii) act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation,
filing and audit of any Tax Return (including filing Form 8594 with a federal
income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing).
Neither Buyer nor the SN Parties shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation Statement by any Tax Authority without first giving the other Party
prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Buyer or the SN Parties from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation
Statement, and neither Buyer nor the SN Parties shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority
challenging such Allocation Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The SN Parties shall (and, until the Closing, shall cause the
Company to) give any notices to, make any filings with, and use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any authorizations, Consents
and approvals of Governmental Authorities and third parties that are required
in connection with the matters referred to in Section 3.4 and Section 4.2
including the corresponding Schedules (other than those required by the HSR
Act). Each of Buyer and the SN Parties shall give the other Party prompt
notice of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would be reasonably likely to (i) cause a breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants of such Party under this
Agreement or (ii) cause any of the conditions of the other Party to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. If Buyer
has a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b), without
taking into consideration any new information provided by the SN Parties
pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) (the "New Seller Information") for purposes of
qualifying any of the representations and warranties of the SN Parties set
forth in this Agreement, but Buyer elects to proceed with the Closing, then
each of the applicable Schedules shall be deemed to have been amended to
include the New Seller Information, the New Seller Information shall be deemed
to be waived by Buyer and Buyer shall not be entitled to make a Claim thereon
under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

securities Laws. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.3 Operations of the Company. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or as contemplated by Schedule 6.3, until the
Closing, the SN Parties will cause the Company and their Affiliates not to
engage in any practice, take any action or enter into any transaction outside
the ordinary course of business without the prior written consent of Buyer
except in case of emergency or as may otherwise be required to prevent injury
or damage to Persons, property or the environment. Subject to compliance with
Applicable Law, the SN Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
promptly provide to Buyer or its representatives copies of all filings it
makes with respect to the Company or the Company Assets with any Governmental
Authority during such period.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.4 Reasonable Access. Unless prohibited by Applicable Law,
the SN Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, until the
Closing, the Company to permit Buyer and representatives of Buyer to have
reasonable access at reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere
with the normal business operations of the SN Parties or the Company and their
Affiliates, to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including
Tax records), contracts and documents of or pertaining to the Company or the
Company Assets. Buyer shall abide by the SN Parties' and any lessors' safety
rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Company Assets including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the Company Assets. Buyer does hereby RELEASE,

omissions of Buyer or any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties in connection with
any field visit, environmental assessment or other due diligence activity
conducted by Buyer or any of its representatives with respect to the Company
Assets conducted prior to Closing. Such Obligations of Buyer shall apply even
if such Claims arise out of or result from the sole, joint or concurrent
negligence, strict liability or other fault of the Seller Indemnified Parties;
provided, however, the aforementioned Obligations shall not apply to any Claim
to the extent actually resulting on account of the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Seller Indemnified Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.5 Insurance. The Company's insurance policies on the
Midstream Assets are listed on Schedule 6.5. The SN Parties shall cause all
Company insurance policies listed on Schedule 6.5 to remain in force and
effect or to be renewed and maintained in full force and effect through (but

 \t\t\tSection 6.8 HSR Act. To the extent not completed prior to the
Execution Date, the Parties shall prepare, as soon as is practicable, but in
any event within 10 Business Days following the Execution Date, all necessary
filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that may be required under the HSR Act. The Parties shall submit such filings
to the appropriate Governmental Authority as soon as practicable after the
execution hereof for filings under the HSR Act. The Parties shall request
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act for the HSR Act
filing, shall promptly make any appropriate or necessary subsequent or
supplemental filings and shall cooperate in the preparation of such filings as
is reasonably necessary and appropriate. The Parties shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under
any antitrust or trade regulatory laws of any Governmental Authority. Buyer
agrees to take all actions that may be required by the FTC in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably
practicable; provided that, nothing in this Section 6.8 shall require Buyer or
its Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit,
before or after the Closing, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or any of the Company Assets or the Interests; (ii) any
conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any
such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely impact the economic or business
benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; or (iii)
any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Buyer and the SN Parties shall each pay 50% of all filing fees in
connection with all filings under the HSR Act. \t\t

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.1 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such further actions,
including obtaining or transferring to the other Party all necessary Permits,
Consents, orders and Contracts and executing and causing its Affiliates to
execute such further documents, as may be necessary or reasonably requested by
another Party in order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and to
provide such other Party with the intended benefits of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, (i) Seller executing or causing its Affiliates
to execute any further documents, as may be necessary to transfer, upon
completion, all legal right, title and interest in and to the Assets Under
Construction to Buyer, in each case without the payment of any consideration
in addition to the amount contemplated in Section 2.3 hereof and (ii)
transferring or amending, as applicable, appropriate T-4, R-3 and R-5 permits,
filings and reports with the Texas Railroad Commission and air permits with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality from SN Operating, LLC to the
Company or Buyer's designee. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Parties have used their good faith
efforts to identify all of the assets and operations to be purchased by Buyer
in connection with this Agreement. However, due to the age of some of the
assets or operations and the difficulties in locating appropriate data with
respect to some of the assets included in these operations, it is possible
that some of the assets intended to be purchased ultimately by Buyer were not
identified and therefore are not transferred (directly or indirectly) to Buyer
as of the Closing Date. To the extent that any assets owned by an SN Party or
one of its Affiliates (other than the Company) as of the Effective Date were
not identified but form an integral part of the assets and operations of the
Company or the Midstream Assets are subsequently identified, then the intent
of the Parties is that all such unidentified assets are intended to be
conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent any such assets
are identified at a later date, the Parties shall take all appropriate action
required in order to convey such assets to the Company without the payment of
any consideration in addition to the amount contemplated in Section 2.3
hereof. Likewise, to the extent that any assets or operations that are
indirectly conveyed to Buyer hereunder are later identified by the Parties as
assets and operations that the Parties did not intend to convey to Buyer, the
Parties shall take all appropriate action required to convey such assets and
operations to Seller or its Affiliates (as directed by Seller). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.2 Tax Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Taxes. The Parties agree that the income related to the Company
Assets for the period up to and including the Closing Date will be reflected
on the federal income Tax Return of Seller and that Seller shall bear the
liability for any Taxes associated with such income. The Parties further
agree that the income related to the Company Assets for the period after the
Closing Date will be reflected on the federal income Tax Return of Buyer and
that the partners of Buyer shall bear the liability for any Taxes associated
with such income. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Proration of 2015 Ad Valorem Taxes. Ad valorem taxes relating to
the Company Assets for the year ending December 31, 2015 shall be prorated on
a daily basis between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
with Buyer responsible for the prorated portion of such taxes for such period
(for purposes of this Section 7.2(b), "period" means the period beginning on
the assessment date for ad valorem taxes through the day before the next
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t23  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tassessment date for such taxes) up to and including the Closing Date
and Seller responsible for the prorated portion of such taxes after the
Closing Date. The Party that receives the ad valorem tax billing shall
provide a copy of such billing to the other Party together with a calculation
of the prorated ad valorem taxes owed by each Party. The Party that did not
receive the ad valorem tax billing shall pay its prorated portion of the ad
valorem taxes to the billed Party prior to the due date of such taxes and the
billed Party shall be responsible for the timely payment of the ad valorem
taxes to the applicable Tax Authorities \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Transaction Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, filing, recordation,
registration and similar Taxes arising from or associated with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (not including, for the sake of
clarity, the Gathering Agreement) other than Taxes based on income
("Transaction Taxes"), shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. To the
extent under Applicable Law the transferee is responsible for filing Tax
Returns in respect of Transaction Taxes, Buyer shall prepare and file all such
Tax Returns. The Parties shall provide such certificates and other
information and otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably required to
minimize Transaction Taxes. The Party that is not responsible under
Applicable Law for paying the Transaction Taxes shall pay its share of the
Transaction Taxes to the responsible Party prior to the due date of such
Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Following the Closing Date, the
Parties shall cooperate fully with each other and shall make available to the
other, as reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting Party, and
to any Governmental Authority responsible for the administration of any Tax,
all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities or potential
Tax liabilities of the Company for all periods at or prior to the Effective
Date and any information which may be relevant to determining the amount
payable hereunder, and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.3 Cooperation for Litigation and Other Actions. Each Party
shall cooperate reasonably with each other Party, at the requesting Party's
expense (but including only out-of-pocket expenses to unaffiliated third
parties, photocopying and delivery costs and not the costs incurred by any
Party for the wages or other benefits paid to its officers, directors or
employees), in furnishing reasonably available information, testimony and
other assistance in connection with any Claims or other disputes involving any
of the Parties hereto (other than in connection with disputes between the
Parties). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.4 Retention of and Access to Books and Records.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On or before the Closing Date, the SN Parties will deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer, the Books and Records that are in the
possession or control of the SN Parties or their Affiliates.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Buyer agrees to afford the SN Parties and their Affiliates and
their respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records at no
cost to the SN Parties or their Affiliates (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses); provided that such access will not be construed to require
the disclosure  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t24  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tof Books and Records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-
client, work product or like privilege; provided, further, that in the event
of any litigation, nothing herein shall limit any Party's rights of discovery
under Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentences, Buyer agrees to provide SN Parties and their Affiliates reasonable
access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records after the
Closing for the purposes of assisting SN Parties and their Affiliates (i) in
complying with the SN Parties' obligations under this Agreement; (ii) in
adjusting, prorating and settling the charges and credits provided for under
this Agreement; (iii) in preparing Tax Returns; (iv) in responding to or
disputing any tax audit; (v) in asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with
any Claim or dispute, known or unknown, under this Agreement; and (vi) in
asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any third-party Claim or
dispute by or against SN Parties and their Affiliates relating to the
Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or
anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any Books and
Records the transfer or other disclosure of which to Buyer would waive (or
would reasonably risk the waiver of) any attorney/client, work product, tax
practitioner, audit or other privilege relating to the Retained Obligations,
the SN Parties shall not be required to transfer such Books and Records (or
any copies thereof) to Buyer until the appropriate Parties enter into a
mutually-agreed joint defense agreement to allow for the sharing of common
defense privileged materials. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.5 SEC Matters. The SN Parties acknowledge that Buyer may be
required to include financial statements relating to the Company ("SEC
Financial Statements") in documents filed with the SEC by Buyer pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and that such SEC Financial Statements
may be required to be audited. In that regard, the SN Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, and provide Buyer reasonable access to such
records (to the extent such information is available) and personnel of the SN
Parties and the Company as Buyer may reasonably request to enable Buyer, and
its representatives and accountants, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, to
create and audit any SEC Financial Statements that Buyer deems necessary. The
SN Parties hereby consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of
the SEC Financial Statements in any registration statement, report or other
document of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to be filed with the SEC in which
Buyer or its Affiliate reasonably determines that the SEC Financial Statements
are required to be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy any rule
or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Upon request of Buyer, the SN Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the external audit firm
that audits the SEC Financial Statements to consent to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of its audit opinion with respect to any applicable
audited financial statements of Buyer in any such registration statement,
report or other document and to provide customary comfort letters as required
by Buyer's underwriters. The SN Parties shall provide Buyer and its
independent accountants with access to (i) any audit work papers of the SN
Parties' independent accountants and (ii) any management representation
letters provided by the SN Parties to the SN Parties' independent accountants.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand the SN Parties'
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or give Buyer, its Affiliates or any third party any rights to which
it is not entitled hereunder. Buyer hereby releases the Seller Indemnified
Parties from, and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold the Seller
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, in each case, any and all
Losses (including costs of investigation and attorneys' and experts' fees and
expenses) relating to, arising out of or connected with, directly or
indirectly, any actions, representations or  \t\t

 \t\t\tcertifications of the SN Parties and their Affiliates personnel or
auditors with respect to the access, records and cooperation provided pursuant
to this Section 7.5, or Buyer's use of information contained in such records
or the inclusion of such financial records in any debt or equity offering
documents or related materials. THESE INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATIONS APPLY
REGARDLESS WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OR ARISE OUT OF, SOLELY OR
IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, GROSS, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY
OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES; PROVIDED HOWEVER THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY
AND DEFENSE OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY. \t\t

10.1(c) due to a material breach of this Agreement by Buyer, then the SN
Parties shall be entitled to seek all rights and remedies at law or in equity
against Buyer or its Affiliates. Each of Buyer and the SN Parties agree to
waive any requirement for the posting of a bond in connection with any such
equitable relief in favor of the other Party.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b) due
to a material breach of this Agreement by the SN Parties, then Buyer shall be
entitled to seek all rights and remedies at law or in equity against the SN
Parties or their Affiliates. Each of Buyer and the SN Parties agree to waive

 \t\t\tArticle XI. 
INDEMNIFICATION  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.1 Indemnification. From and after the Closing and subject
to the provisions of this Article XI, (i) the SN Parties agree to indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Buyer
Indemnified Costs and (ii) Buyer agrees to indemnify  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

all Seller Indemnified Costs. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.2 Defense of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party
shall give prompt written notice to the SN Parties or Buyer, as applicable
(the "Indemnifying Party"), of the commencement or assertion of any Claim by a
third party (collectively, a "third-party action") in respect of which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it, he, or she may have to such Indemnified Party under this
Article XI unless the failure to give such notice materially and adversely
prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to assume control of the defense of, settle, or otherwise dispose of such
third-party action on such terms as it deems appropriate; provided, however,
that:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such third-party action (provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party
if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such
third-party action; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have charge of
such third-party action; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party;
or (iv) the Indemnified Party's counsel shall have advised the Indemnified
Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there
is a material conflict of interest that could violate applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel);  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of
the Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgment of the validity of such third-party
action or any liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgment could have a material adverse effect with respect to the
Indemnified Party;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of the Indemnified
Party that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
each claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability in respect of such third-party action; and  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall
be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the third-party action seeks
an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t30  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tor acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the
defense of any third-party action pursuant to this Article XI and, in
connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and
appeals as may be reasonably requested.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 11.2 because
no third-party action is involved, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such Indemnified
Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. Subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 11.4(a), the failure of the
Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount
to a waiver of such claim unless the resulting delay materially prejudices the
position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.4 Limitations. The following provisions of this Section
11.4 shall limit the indemnification obligations hereunder:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified
Costs pursuant to this Article XI unless a written claim for indemnification
in accordance with Section 11.2 or Section 11.3 is given by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Houston, Texas time, on or prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months
after of the Closing Date; provided, however, that written claims for
indemnification (i) for Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Article III, Section 4.1, Section
4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.6, Section 4.7, Section 4.8, Section 5.1,
Section 5.2 and Section 5.5 (the "Fundamental Representations") may be made at
any time and (ii) for Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any
covenant may be made at any time.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except as set forth in this Agreement, an Indemnified Party will
not be entitled to any Indemnified Costs with respect to any individual Claim
that does not equal or exceed $150,000 (the "Individual Indemnity Threshold")
and all such Claims that equal or exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold
must collectively also exceed the Indemnity Deductible, and thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnity for the amount in excess
of the Indemnity Deductible, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement. Except as set forth below, the maximum aggregate liability of the
SN Parties under Section 11.1 of this Agreement shall not exceed the Indemnity
Cap. Except as set forth below, the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer
under Section 11.1 of this Agreement shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The limitations set forth above in this Section 11.4 shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification under Section 11.1 with respect to any
breach of (i) the Fundamental Representations or (ii) the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Article XI of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t31  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing Date,
except as otherwise set forth in Article XII of this Agreement, Buyer's and
the other Buyer Indemnified Parties' and the SN Parties' and the other Seller
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Indemnified
Costs shall be in accordance with, and limited by, the provisions set forth in
this Article XI.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) For purposes of determining any Losses resulting from a breach of
any of the SN Parties' representations and warranties contained in Article III
or Article IV of this Agreement for which Buyer Indemnified Parties would be
entitled to indemnification, any dollar or materiality qualifications in the
SN Parties' representations and warranties shall be disregarded. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.5 Tax Treatment of Payment of Indemnity Costs. The SN
Parties and Buyer agree that any payment of Indemnified Costs made hereunder
will be treated by the Parties on their Tax Returns as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.6 Express Negligence Rule. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE
INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS
TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY
SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE
OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
FAULT OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tArticle XII. 
MISCELLANEOUS  \t\t

ORDERS OR REQUIREMENTS); OR (E) THE HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY,
MARKETABILITY, PROFITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE ASSETS
OF THE COMPANY. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT  \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.3 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective
under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance will be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision hereof, and the Parties will negotiate in good faith with
a view to substitute for such provision a suitable and equitable solution in
order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.5 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the
State of Texas, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might
refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of
another state.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Texas
over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined only in such courts. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any dispute arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t34  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParty agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each of the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any state or federal court located in the State of Texas, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the Parties hereto further hereby waives (i) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(ii) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.6 Confidentiality. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Obligations. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to retain the other Party's Confidential Information in confidence and not
disclose the same to any third party nor use the same, except as authorized by
the disclosing Party in writing or as expressly permitted in this Section
12.6. Each Party further agrees to take the same care with the other Party's
Confidential Information as it does with its own, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding Section 12.6(a) above, if the
receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose the Confidential
Information by a court, Governmental Authority or Applicable Law, including
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or is
required to disclose pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange upon which the receiving Party or its parent entity is
listed, any of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the receiving
Party shall promptly advise the disclosing Party of such requirement to
disclose Confidential Information as soon as the receiving Party becomes aware
that such a requirement to disclose might become effective, in order that,
where possible, the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or such other
remedy as the disclosing Party may consider appropriate in the circumstances.
The receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the disclosing Party's
Confidential Information that it is required to disclose and shall cooperate
with the disclosing Party in allowing the disclosing Party to obtain such
protective order or other relief. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Return of Information. Upon written request by the disclosing
Party, all of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information in whatever form
shall be returned to the disclosing Party upon termination of this Agreement
or destroyed with destruction certified by the receiving Party, without the
receiving Party retaining copies thereof except that one copy of all such
Confidential Information may be retained by a Party's legal department for
purposes of resolving any dispute that may arise hereunder or for complying
with Applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange applicable to the
Party, and the receiving Party shall be entitled to retain any Confidential
Information in electronic form stored on automatic computer back-up archiving
systems during the period such backup or archived materials are retained under
such Party's customary procedures and policies; provided, however, that any
Confidential Information retained by the receiving Party shall be maintained
subject to confidentiality pursuant to the terms  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t35  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tof this Section 12.6, and such archived or back-up Confidential
Information shall not be accessed except as required by Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Receiving Party Personnel. The receiving Party will limit access
to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to those of its
employees, attorneys, representatives and contractors that have a need to know
such information in order for the receiving Party to exercise or perform its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (the "Receiving Party Personnel").
The Receiving Party Personnel who have access to any Confidential Information
of the disclosing Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision of
this Agreement, and will be required to abide by the terms thereof.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Survival. The obligation of confidentiality under this Section
12.6 shall survive until the second anniversary the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their successors
and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person (other than the Indemnified Parties
with respect to Article XI and the Parties' respective Affiliates with respect
to Section 12.1) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.8 Assignment of Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any
Party without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.9 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for
purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
interpretation hereof.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf))
for the convenience of the Parties hereto, each of which counterparts will be
deemed an original, but all of which counterparts together will constitute one
and the same agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.11 Integration. This Agreement supersedes any previous
understandings or agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with
respect to their subject matter. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. No understanding, representation, promise or agreement, whether oral
or written, is intended to be or shall be included in or form part of this
Agreement unless it is contained in a written amendment hereto or thereto and
executed by the Parties hereto or thereto after the date of this Agreement.
For the sake of clarity, the representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in this Agreement shall not be limited by the Bill of Sale. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.12 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only
in a writing signed by all Parties. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be set
forth in writing. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or
waive any Party's rights at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter
with every term or condition of this Agreement. Any amendment or waiver
executed by any of the Parties or their respective subsidiaries shall not be
effective unless and until the execution of such  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tamendment or waiver has been approved by, with respect to Buyer, the
conflicts committee of the board of directors of the General Partner, and with
respect to the SN Parties, the audit committee of the board of directors of
SN. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.13 Buyer Right of First Offer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) As provided in and subject to the other provisions of this Section
12.13, SN hereby grants to Buyer, for a period of 15 years after the Closing
Date, a right of first offer on the ROFO Assets to the extent that SN or any
SN Subsidiary (a "Transferring Entity") proposes to Transfer all or any part
of such ROFO Assets to any Person that is not an Affiliate of SN. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If any Transferring Entity proposes to Transfer all or any portion
of any ROFO Asset (other than to SN or an Affiliate thereof), SN shall, or
shall to the extent it has the legal right, cause the applicable Transferring
Entity to, prior to entering into any such transaction, first give written
notice to Buyer (the "ROFO Notice") of its intention to enter into such
transaction. The ROFO Notice shall include a description of the ROFO Assets
which the Transferring Entity proposes to Transfer as would be reasonably
necessary for Buyer to make an offer to purchase the ROFO Assets from the
applicable Transferring Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Buyer shall have 20 days following receipt of the ROFO Notice to
propose a bona fide offer to purchase the ROFO Assets from the Transferring
Entity that provided such ROFO Notice (the "ROFO Response"). The ROFO
Response shall set forth the material terms and conditions (including, without
limitation, the purchase price that Buyer proposes to pay for the ROFO Asset
and the other material terms of the purchase) pursuant to which Buyer would be
willing and able to enter into a binding agreement for the transaction. If no
ROFO Response is delivered by Buyer within such 20-day period or if Buyer
otherwise informs the Transferring Entity that it does not intend to provide a
ROFO Response, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right of first
offer with respect to such ROFO Asset, and the Transferring Entity shall be
free to enter into a transaction with any third party on terms and conditions
determined in the sole discretion of the Transferring Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If Buyer submits a ROFO Response which the Transferring Entity is
willing to accept, SN shall, or shall to the extent it has the legal right,
cause the applicable Transferring Entity to, negotiate in good faith with
Buyer with respect to such transaction for a period of 30 days from the date
of such ROFO Response (the "Negotiation Period"). If Buyer submits a ROFO
Response which the Transferring Entity is not willing to accept, or if Buyer
and the Transferring Entity are unable to reach terms with respect to a
definitive agreement within the Negotiation Period, SN and/or the Transferring
Entity may enter into an agreement with a third party to Transfer the ROFO
Assets described in the ROFO Notice but SN agrees that, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, it shall not, or shall to the extent it has the
legal right, cause the Transferring Entity to not, enter into a definitive
transfer agreement with any third party with respect to such ROFO Assets at
any time during the 120-day period commencing from the ROFO Response at a
price which is lower than that proposed by Buyer in the ROFO Response and
which are on terms which are materially more favorable to such third party
than those set forth in the ROFO Response. If the Transferring Entity does
not enter into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to such
a transaction within such 120-day period, then SN shall, or shall to the
extent it has the legal right, cause such Transferring Entity to, comply with
the provisions of this  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.13 again prior to entering into any transaction with
respect to such ROFO Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing of
this Section 12.13 constitutes a right of first offer (and not a right of
first refusal) which entitles Buyer the right to make an initial offer with
respect to the Transfer of the ROFO Assets but which does not grant to Buyer
the right to match an offer from a third party with respect to the ROFO
Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.14 Mitigation. Each Party shall take all reasonable steps,
and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Parties in good faith, to
mitigate damages in respect of any Claim under Article XI for which it or
another Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, is
seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or
expenses associated with such Claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be
avoided, to minimize the amount thereof. Further, no Party shall take nor
fail to take any action, which action or inaction induces, incentivizes or
otherwise is reasonably likely to lead a third party to make a Claim against a
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, for which it seeks
indemnification under Article XI. Additionally, if any provision of this
Agreement or the Gathering Agreement, if complied with or performed, would
result (or has resulted) in any breach or other violation (or is being
challenged as a breach or other violation) of any Dedicated Instrument,
otherwise conflicts (or is being challenged as conflicting) with any Dedicated
Instrument, or would otherwise give (or has otherwise given) rise to a Claim
under this Agreement or the Gathering Agreement as a result of such a breach
or other violation or conflict (or challenge) with respect to any Dedicated
Instrument, each Party shall take all reasonable steps, and shall reasonably
cooperate with the other Parties in good faith, to mitigate damages with
respect to such a breach or other violation or conflict (or challenge) and to
amend this Agreement and/or the Gathering Agreement (and/or enter into other
mutually acceptable agreements or arrangements) to the extent necessary to
effect the original intent of the Parties and maintain the Parties' relative
economic burdens and benefits, as closely as possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tArticle XIII. 
INTERPRETATION  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 13.1 Interpretation. It is expressly agreed that this
Agreement shall not be construed against any Party, and no consideration shall

reflects its understanding of the transaction that this Agreement

not limited to" and corresponding derivative expressions;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) a defined term has its defined meaning throughout this Agreement
and each Exhibit to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears before or
after the place where it is defined;  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t38  \t\t  \t\t

prevail;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) the term "cost" includes expense and the term "expense" includes

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 13.2 References, Gender, Number. All references in this
Agreement to an "Article," "Section," "subsection" or "Exhibit" shall be to an

requires otherwise. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the words
