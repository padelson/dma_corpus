CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

Section 2.1 _Merger Consideration_.

(a) Unless otherwise adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3, each Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, but
excluding any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.5 hereof), shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive (i) a
number of common shares, $1.00 par value, of Prosperity (" _Prosperity Common
Shares_ ") equal to the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten thousandth (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), obtained by dividing 8,525,000 (the " _Stock
Consideration_ ") by the number of Company Shares outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time (" _Company Closing Shares_ "), plus cash in lieu of
any fractional Prosperity Common Share, and (ii) an amount of cash equal to
$178,500,000 (the " _Cash Consideration_ ," and together with the Stock
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), divided by the
Company Closing Shares (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by the Bank (other than (i) Company Shares held, directly or
indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii)

cancelled without any conversion and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.

will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional Prosperity
Common Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional shares, Prosperity shall pay to each former
holder of Company Shares otherwise entitled to receive such fractional share
an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing Price by
(ii) the fraction of a Prosperity Common Share which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.1. " _Average
Closing Price_ " of Prosperity Common Shares shall be the average of the
closing price per Prosperity Common Share on The New York Stock Exchange ("
_NYSE_ ") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported
thereby, another alternative source as chosen by Prosperity) for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth trading day
preceding the Closing Date.

Section 2.2 _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The aggregate number of
Prosperity Common Shares to be exchanged for each Company Share shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect any change in the number of Prosperity
Common Shares by reason of any stock dividends or splits, reclassification,
recapitalization or conversion with respect to Prosperity Common Shares,
received or to be received by holders of Prosperity Common Shares, when
the record date or payment occurs before the Effective Time.

 



-4-  Section 2.3 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration for Equity Capital_.

 

(a) If the Equity Capital (as defined below) on the Closing Date is less than
$275,000,000, the Cash Consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to
the difference between $275,000,000 and the Equity Capital on the Closing
Date.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Capital_ " shall equal the sum
of the capital stock, capital surplus and retained earnings of the Company,
excluding unrealized securities gains or losses, on a consolidated basis, as
determined pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ").
For purposes of calculating Equity Capital, the Company shall include
deductions for (i) the after-tax amount of any fees and commissions payable to
any broker, finder, financial advisor or investment banking firm in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
the after-tax amount of any legal and accounting fees incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) the after-tax premium or additional cost incurred to provide for the
continuation of certain of the Companys insurance policies pursuant to
Section 5.9, (iv) the estimated after-tax amount of any penalty or liquidated
damages associated with the termination of the Companys contracts with any
provider of electronic banking and data processing services, assuming that
those contracts are terminated on September 30, 2012, (v) the after-tax
amount of any payments to be made by the Company or the Bank pursuant to any
existing employment, change in control or other similar agreements or
severance, retention or bonus arrangements between the Company or the Bank
and any other person, including but not limited to those pursuant to Section
10.5, (vi) the accrual through the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP, and
confirmed by a third-party consultant of Prosperity, of any future benefit
payments due under any salary continuation, deferred compensation or other
similar agreements, (vii) the payment of the dividend contemplated by Section
5.2(x)(A)(3), (viii) any amount required to be added to the Companys
allowance for loan losses pursuant to Section 5.10 hereof and (ix) such other
amounts as are agreed upon by the Company and Prosperity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Equity Capital will not be adjusted for any adjustment required by
Prosperity pursuant to Section 5.8.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Options_. Not later than 10 days after the
Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1), the Company Board will accelerate the
time at which each option to acquire Company Shares (each a " _Company Option_
") may be exercised for a limited period of time on or before a date chosen by
the Company Board (which date will be before the Effective Time) (the "
_Specified Date_ "). After the Specified Date, all unexercised Options will
terminate. On or before the Specified Date, each Company Option may be
exercised for cash by the holder thereof in accordance with its terms. The
Company may provide financing to each holder of Company Options for the
exercise price, bearing interest at a rate of 3% per annum, provided that (a)
the Company takes a lien against the Company Shares acquired through exercise
of the Company Options, (b) the financing documents provide that the borrower
must use the Per Share Cash Consideration received from the Company Shares
acquired through exercise of the Company Options to reduce the amount of
funds borrowed from the Company and (c) after that reduction, the borrower
must refinance any remaining indebtedness with a lender other than the Company
within thirty (30) days after the Effective Time.

 



-5-  Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Company Shares issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, the holder of which
has voted against the approval of the Merger and who has properly perfected
his dissenters rights of appraisal by following the exact procedure required

_Dissenting Share_." Each Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article II and shall be entitled only to such rights as are available to such
holder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the TBOC. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the value of such Dissenting
Shares held by him in accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBOC;
_provided_ , such holder complies with the procedures contemplated by and set
forth in the applicable provisions of the TBOC. If any holder of any
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose his dissenters rights
under the applicable provisions of the TBOC, each such Dissenting Share shall
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon in
accordance with the provisions of this Article II.

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) Prosperity shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with
Computershare Investor Services, Inc., Denver, Colorado (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") (i) certificates representing Prosperity Common Shares and (ii) cash

Cash Consideration, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3, (B) to
holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 2.5. if any, and (C) holders
of a fraction of a share of Prosperity Common Shares pursuant to Section
2.1(c) (such certificates and cash being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as
provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with the intent to be
within eight (8) business days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or
certificates which as of the Effective Date represented Company Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") as of that date a letter of transmittal that will specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the Company
Shares represented by such Certificate(s) will have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transmittal Materials_ "). The form
and substance of the Transmittal Materials are to be acceptable to Prosperity
and the Company before they are mailed to the holders of the Certificates.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the
Transmittal Materials duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and number of
Prosperity Common Shares provided in Section 2.1, as may be adjusted pursuant
to Sections 2.2 and 2.3, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.
Prosperity shall provide the Exchange Agent with certificates for Prosperity
Common Shares, as requested by the Exchange Agent, for the number of shares
provided in Section 2.1, as may be adjusted. No interest will be paid or
accrued with respect to the Prosperity Common Shares or cash payable upon
surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.6, after the Effective Time, each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for
all purposes the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon.

 



-6-  (c) Promptly after receipt of such Transmittal Materials, Prosperity will
cause the Exchange Agent to review the Transmittal Materials in order to
verify proper completion and execution thereof. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time or within 5 days after surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, together with properly completed and executed Transmittal
Materials, Prosperity will cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the former
shareholder of the Company (" _Shareholder_ ") the Per Share Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate and issue certificates for Prosperity Common Shares equal to the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Prosperity Common Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall
be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such
Certificate and duly executed Transmittal Materials to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Section 2.6. After the surrender of a Certificate and
duly executed Transmittal Materials in accordance with this Section 2.6, the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which had become payable after the
Effective Time with respect to the Prosperity Common Shares represented by
such Certificate.

(e) After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of the
Company for the Company Shares which were outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
Prosperity, they shall be promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.6.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company
for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the Transmittal Materials
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be returned to Prosperity upon demand, and
any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures in this Article II shall look to Prosperity only, and not
the Exchange Agent, for the payment of any Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares.

(g) If any certificate representing Prosperity Common Shares is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form (reasonably satisfactory to Prosperity) for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing Prosperity Common Shares in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or not payable.

 



-7-  (h) None of Prosperity, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for any Prosperity
Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. 

(i) If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Prosperity or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount (not to exceed the amount of
Merger Consideration relating to the relevant missing Certificate) as
Prosperity or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Prosperity with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

or any of its ERISA Affiliates or to which the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates contributes or is obligated to contribute on behalf of current or
former employees, directors or consultants of the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates or with respect to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
has any liability, including, without

 



-22-   limitation, any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ "), any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA or any employment agreement or collective bargaining, bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, stock purchase, stock option, severance,
change of control or fringe benefit plan (" _Company Employee Plan_ "). There
is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened litigation,
administrative action, investigation, audit or similar proceeding relating to
any Company Employee Plan. All of the Company Employee Plans comply and have
been administered in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. There has occurred no "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
with respect to the Company Employee Plans which is likely to result in the
imposition of any penalties or taxes upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. All
contributions, premiums or other payments required by law or by any Company
Employee Plan have been made by the due date thereof.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
post-retirement or post-employment benefits under any Company Employee Plan
that cannot be amended or terminated upon 60 days notice or less without
incurring any liability thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, or similar state laws, the cost
of which is borne by the insured individuals. Each Company Employee Plan that
is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code is qualified in form and operation in all material respects and the
Company is not aware of any event or circumstance that would disqualify any
such Company Employee Plan. The Company has provided or made available copies

Plans.

liability or contingent liability with respect to a "multiemployer plan"

None of the Company or any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time
during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute
to any Multiemployer Plan, and none of the Company, or any of its respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability under Part I of
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full. Neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or contributes to any
employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and none of the
Company or any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the
last six (6) years, sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(d) There does not now exist, nor, to the Companys Knowledge, do any
circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that
would be a material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries now
or following the Closing. " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all
liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA, (2) under Section 302 of ERISA, (3)
under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (4) as a result of a failure to

provisions of foreign laws or regulations.

 



-23-  (e) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, could give rise to the payment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. Except
as required by the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability to provide post-retirement health or life
benefits to any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(f) " _ERISA Affiliates_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade or
business, any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a group

is a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or
business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(d)_ , there are no outstanding
compensatory equity awards, including any arrangements awarding stock

stock or any other equity compensation to any employee, director or other
service provider of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

arrangement satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the
extent applicable, in form and operation.

forth in _Schedule 3.24_, neither the Company nor any of its officers,

investment banker or incurred any liability for any brokerage, financial
advisory, investment banking or other similar fees or commissions in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

properties and assets of the Company is permitted only in accordance with

examination and the Company has no Knowledge of any reason why the Bank will
not receive a rating of "satisfactory" or better pursuant to its next CRA
compliance examination or why the FDIC, the TDB, or any other governmental
entity would reasonably be expected to seek to restrain, delay or prohibit the
transactions contemplated hereby as a result of any act or omission of the
Bank under the CRA.

claimed before, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part
out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was acting in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or the Bank to the fullest
extent that the Indemnified Party would be entitled under the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company or the Articles of Association of the Bank, as
applicable, in each case as in effect on the date hereof and to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

 



-43-  (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, is to promptly notify Prosperity, but the failure to so notify
will not relieve Prosperity of any liability it may have to the Indemnified
Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice Prosperity. In any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) Prosperity will have the right to assume the
defense thereof and Prosperity will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Prosperity elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts
of interest between Prosperity and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Prosperity, and Prosperity
will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Party (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the
Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
Prosperity will not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent and (iv) Prosperity will have no obligation hereunder if
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.

being satisfied.

Section 7.2  _Confidentiality_.

(a) Prosperity and the Company will not disclose, and will cause their

Section 9.1 _Termination_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned by action
of the Board of Directors of Prosperity or the Company at any time before the
Effective Time if:

(i) any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United
States (federal or state) governmental body shall have issued an order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall be
final and non-appealable;

(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved by
any regulatory authority or other person whose approval is required to

(iii) the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the 180th day after the
date of this Agreement, unless one or more of the Regulatory Approvals has
not been received on or before the 165th day after the date of this Agreement,
in which instance the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the 210th
day after the date of this Agreement, or such later date as has been approved
in writing by the Boards of Directors of Prosperity and the Company; but the
right to terminate under this Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the
Merger to become effective on or before such applicable date; or

(iv) the approval of the shareholders of the Company contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
required vote at the Meeting at which they consider the Agreement.

 

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time by
action of the Company Board if Prosperity fails to comply in any material
respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
or if any of the representations or warranties of Prosperity contained herein
shall be inaccurate in any material respect. If the Company Board desires to
terminate this Agreement because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as
provided in this Section 9.1(b), the Company Board must notify Prosperity in
writing of its intent to terminate stating the reason therefor. Prosperity
will have 15 days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach
or inaccuracy.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time by
action of the Prosperity Board if (i) the Company fails to comply in any
material respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company
contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) any
approval required to be obtained from any regulatory authority or agency is
obtained subject to restrictions or conditions on the operations of the
Company, the Bank, Prosperity or Prosperity Bank that are reasonably

days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach or inaccuracy.

 

(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing upon the
mutual written consent of Prosperity and the Company and the approval of such
action by their respective Boards of Directors.

(e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by the
Company Board if before the Effective Time, the Company receives an
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(d)) and
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment and in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties, based on the advice of outside legal counsel and the
Financial Advisor, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant
to its terms and after giving effect to the payment of the Termination Fee and
Prosperity Expenses (each as defined in Section 9.3(a)(i)) is a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(f)) and (ii) the failure to terminate this
Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
proper exercise of such fiduciary duties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Prosperity at least five
(5) business days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice advises Prosperity that the Company Board has received a
Superior Proposal, specifies the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or "Group" (as such
term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) making the Superior
Proposal); and

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company negotiates, and causes the
Financial Advisor and outside counsel to negotiate, with Prosperity in good
faith (to the extent Prosperity desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and the Company
Board considers such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
resulting from such negotiations and concludes in good faith based upon
consultations with the Financial Advisor and the advice of outside legal
counsel that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal even after
giving effect to the adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Prosperity.

 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines such
revisions are material, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to
Prosperity and shall comply with the requirements of this Section 9.1(e) with
respect to such new written notice, except that the new Notice Period shall be
three (3) business days. Termination under this clause (e) shall not be
deemed effective until payment of the Termination Fee and/or Prosperity
Expenses as required by Section 9.3.

(f) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by the
Prosperity Board if (i) the Company has materially breached the covenant
contained in 

 



-48-   Section 5.5 in a manner adverse to Prosperity; (ii) the Company Board
resolves to accept an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) the Company Board
withdraws or modifies, in any manner that is adverse to Prosperity, its
recommendation or approval of this Agreement or the Merger or recommended to
the Company shareholders acceptance or approval of any alternative Acquisition
Proposal, or resolves to do any of the foregoing. 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section 9.3, if
this Agreement is terminated by either Prosperity or the Company as provided
in Section 9.1, this Agreement (other than Section 7.2) will become void and
have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its
directors, officers or shareholders, except that the provisions of Sections
5.14, 7.2, 9.2 and 13.4 will survive termination of this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Section 9.2 will relieve any party hereto of any liability
for a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fee and Expenses_. To compensate Prosperity for
entering into this Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto
and other losses and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other
opportunities by Prosperity, the Company and Prosperity agree as follows: 

(a) Provided that Prosperity is not in material breach of any covenant or
obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured within
fifteen (15) days following receipt of written notice thereof by the Company
specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), if this
Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) the Company under the provisions of Section 9.1(e), then the Company shall
pay to Prosperity the sum of $20,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus all
expenses incurred by Prosperity in connection with the proposed transaction,
_provided_ that the aggregate amount of all such expenses shall not exceed
$750,000 (" _Prosperity Expenses_ ");

(ii) Prosperity under the provisions of Section 9.1(f), then the Company shall
pay to Prosperity the Termination Fee plus the Prosperity Expenses;

(iii) either Prosperity or the Company under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at the time of termination, the Registration Statement has
been declared effective at least 25 business days prior to such date and the
Company shall have failed to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1, or (B) Section 9.1(a)(iv), if, at the
time of termination, there exists an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company, then the Company shall pay to Prosperity the Prosperity Expenses; or

(iv) either Prosperity or the Company under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at such time the shareholders of the Company have not
approved and adopted the Agreement and the Merger, or (B) Section 9.1(a)(iv),
if, at the time of termination, there exists an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company and, with respect to either clause (A) or (B), within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters
into an Acquisition Agreement with any third

 



-49-   party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay
to Prosperity the Termination Fee, which shall be in addition to the
Prosperity Expenses to be paid pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iii).

The payment of the Termination Fee and/or Prosperity Expenses shall be
Prosperitys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to termination of this
Agreement as set forth in this Section 9.3(a). For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall the Termination Fee described in this Section 9.3 be payable on
more than one occasion.

 

(b) Any payment required by Section 9.3(a) shall become payable within two (2)
business days after receipt by the non-terminating party of written notice of
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the payment of
the Termination Fee is required pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iv), then such
payment shall become payable on or before the date of execution by the
Company of an Acquisition Agreement.

consolidated statement of condition prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means any
transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase
from the Company by any person or "Group" (as such term is defined in Section
13(d) under the Exchange Act), other than Prosperity or any of its
Affiliates, of 20% or more in interest of the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or Group (other
than Prosperity or any of its Affiliates) beneficially owning 20% or more in
interest of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the shareholders

the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity (which includes the
parent corporation of any constituent corporation to any such transaction) of

fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board reasonably

 



-50-   determines, in its good faith judgment based on, among other things, the
advice of outside counsel and the Financial Advisor, (i) to be more favorable

taking into account all terms and conditions of the proposal and (ii)
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory (including the advice of outside
counsel regarding the potential for regulatory approval of any such proposal)
and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted
under applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" and "80%" in the definitions
