to the extent required by Law, of the amounts allocated to any Subsidiaries
classified as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes among
the assets of such entities, consistent with the procedures in Section 2.09
and in accordance with applicable Law (the "Allocation Statement"). If Buyer
does not object to the Allocation Statement within thirty (30) Business Days
after receipt, the Allocation Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties. If Buyer does object to the Allocation Statement within such period,
Seller shall make any changes reasonably requested by Buyer. Promptly after
any adjustment to the amount of the Purchase Price, including pursuant to
Article VI and Article IX, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
mutually agree to appropriate revisions to the Allocation Statement, in
accordance with the principles and procedures of this Section 2.07(b). The
Parties agree that they will not, and will not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, take a position (except as required pursuant to any order of a
Governmental Authority) on any Tax Return (including, but not limited to,
Internal



Revenue Service Form 8594) or in any audit or examination before any
Governmental Authority that is in any way inconsistent with the Allocation
Statement (as such may be adjusted); provided, however, that nothing herein
shall prevent the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates from settling,
or require them to litigate before any court, any challenge, proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation Statement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of Buyer and Seller shall notify the other Party of any such
Action taken by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Allocation
Statement, and neither Party shall settle or otherwise compromise such Action
without the other Party's prior written consent (not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 2.08. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Shares and the
Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder shall

transactions taking place at the Closing shall be deemed to occur

(a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller and the Equity Sellers the Purchase Price in

by the Title Company to issue an ALTA Owner's or Title Insurance

(collectively, the "Owner's Policies"), and all costs, expenses and premiums
with respect to the Owner's Policies (and all endorsements thereto) shall be
divided equally between Seller and Buyer;

(e) Seller and each Retained Subsidiary (to the extent each such Retained
Subsidiary is selling, transferring, conveying or assigning any Purchased

Section 2.09. Adjustment Amount.

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, (i)
its good faith estimate of (A) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital"), (B) the aggregate amount of all
Indebtedness of the Purchased Subsidiary Companies as of the close of business
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness"), and (C) the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Business (the
"Estimated Closing Date Cash"), (ii) reasonable supporting documentation for
such estimates, and (iii) Seller's calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with Schedule
1.01(f), and each of Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and Estimated Closing
Date Cash shall be calculated in accordance with the definitions thereof.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller (i) an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet"), (ii) a calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
(iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the
Purchased Subsidiary



Companies as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Date
Indebtedness"), and (iv) a calculation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Business (the "Closing Date Cash"), in each case, determined without giving
effect to (A) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustments as a result of the application of
purchase accounting) or (B) any financing transactions in connection
therewith, by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Subsidiaries)
after the Closing. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Following the Closing until the Determination Date (as defined
below), each Party shall provide the other Party and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and following reasonable
written notice to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors of
such Party reasonably relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet
and/or Dispute Notice (as defined below), as applicable, and shall cause the
personnel of such Party and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with the
other Party and its Representatives in connection with their review of the
Closing Balance Sheet and/or Dispute Notice, as applicable.

(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness or the Closing Date Cash, it shall
notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of such disagreement (the "Dispute Notice"), within
thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event
that Seller does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty
(30)-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Indebtedness and the Closing Date Cash delivered by Buyer, which shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect
to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Indebtedness or the Closing Date Cash. If, at the end of such period, they are
unable to resolve such disagreements, then Ernst and Young LLP (or such
independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller) (the "Auditor"),
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which such dispute is
referred to the Auditor, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in
accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.09(b) and (only with
respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) whether and
to what extent (if any) the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Indebtedness or the Closing Date Cash require adjustment. The Auditor shall
not be permitted to make a determination with respect to any item as to which
there is a disagreement that exceeds or is less than the greatest or lowest
value, respectively, for such item as claimed by the Parties, shall limit its
review to the disputed items, and shall limit its review to whether the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness and the Closing Date Cash were prepared
in accordance with this Agreement or contain mathematical/clerical error. The
Auditor shall base its determination solely on the written submissions of the
Parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation. All fees and
expenses of the Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Auditor hereunder shall be borne pro rata as between Seller and Buyer in



proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts in dispute as
between Seller and Buyer (set forth in the written submissions to the Auditor)
made by the Auditor such that the Party prevailing on the greater dollar value
of such disputes pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses. For
example, if Seller challenges items underlying the calculations of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness and/or the Closing
Date Cash in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the Auditor determines that
Buyer has a valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Buyer shall bear 60%
of the fees and expenses of the Auditor and Seller shall bear the remaining
40% of the fees and expenses of the Auditor. The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness and
the Closing Date Cash are finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.09(c) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date."

(d) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall mean (i)
the Closing Date Net Working Capital, minus the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital, plus (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, minus the
Closing Date Indebtedness, plus (iii) the Closing Date Cash, minus the
Estimated Closing Date Cash. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
then the Purchase Price shall be increased by such Adjustment Amount (the
"Increase Amount"), and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment (the
"Deficit Amount"). The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with
Section 2.09(e).

(e) If there is an Increase Amount, then, promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination
Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller in writing an amount in
cash equal to the Increase Amount. If there is a Deficit Amount, then,
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Buyer in writing an amount in cash equal to the Deficit Amount.

Section 2.10. Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to any such payments under the Code or any provision
of state, local, provincial or foreign Law. If Buyer determines that any such
deduction or withholding is required in respect of any payment payable
pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice
prior to the date of the applicable payment, shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller to mitigate any such requirement to the extent permitted by Law and, if
any deduction or withholding is necessary, shall provide Seller with a receipt
from the applicable Taxing Authority documenting the remittance of such
deduction or withholding under the Code or any such Law, if available, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of such deduction or withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and duly deposited with
the appropriate Taxing Authority by Buyer, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Equity Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries to enter into and perform their
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or materially
interfere with the conduct of the Business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.

Liquor License or Permit binding upon it, or (d) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any Purchased Asset, except for Permitted Liens and

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04, assuming compliance with

made or obtained by Seller, each Equity Seller or any Purchased Company in
connection with execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the

Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, limited
liability company or other legal entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which it leases real property or holds licenses (including
Liquor Licenses) or Permits and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business and the lease and operation of its assets and the holding of
its licenses (including Liquor Licenses) or other Permits makes such

such Purchased Company or the Business.

(b) A complete and accurate list of the authorized and outstanding capital

Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Companies) outstanding that upon
conversion or exchange would require, an increase to the value of any capital
stock of any Purchased Company or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase any
capital stock of any Purchased Company. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.05(d), none of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller (including each Equity

Business have been kept accurately in the ordinary course of business

and reserved in the Balance Sheet, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice after the Balance Sheet Date, (c) that
are not described in any other clause of this Section 3.08 and would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in any
Liability in excess of $5,000,000 (d) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (e) that are Retained Liabilities, or (f)
disclosed in Schedule 3.08. Seller (with respect to the Business) and the

(iii) any agreement for the purchase of materials, supplies, goods, services,

Seller's knowledge, as of the date hereof, Seller has not received (i) any
notice of cancellation or termination of any such policies (other than in
connection with ordinary renewals) or refusal of coverage thereunder, (ii) any
notice that any issuer of such policy has filed for protection under
applicable bankruptcy laws or is otherwise in the process of liquidating or

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, SELLER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND
BUYER SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RELY ON, ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,
PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE, COMMUNICATED OR FURNISHED
(ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION OR ADVICE THAT
MAY HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO BUYER BY ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, MANAGER,

ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that:

Section 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power. Buyer is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate or equivalent organizational
power and authority to own or lease its assets and to conduct its business in
all material respects as it is now being conducted. Buyer is duly licensed or
qualified in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or operation of its
assets or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be so
licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
interfere with, prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby are within the limited
liability company powers of Buyer and have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement of Buyer,



enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity.
Each other Transaction Document to which Buyer is a party shall be duly and
validly executed by Buyer at or prior to the Closing and, upon such execution
and delivery by Buyer and the due and valid execution and delivery of such
Transaction Document by each other party thereto, shall constitute a legal,
valid and binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally
and to general principles of equity.

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby require no material
action by or in respect of, or material filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR
Act and other Competition Laws.

Section 4.04. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and shall not (i) violate the
Organizational Documents of Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, violate any Law, (iii) require any consent or
other action by any Person under, constitute a default under or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material right
or obligation or to a loss of any material benefit to which Buyer is entitled
under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon Buyer or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any material Lien on any asset of
Buyer (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents).

Section 4.05. Financing. Buyer has delivered to Seller a true and complete
copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter,
attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively (including, in each case,
the exhibits and annexes thereto). Neither of the Commitment Letters has been
amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or
other arrangement (other than customary engagement letters and fee letters
that Buyer has delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof (with only fee
amounts and the "market flex" provisions relating to the pricing and other
economic terms of the Debt Financing redacted) relating to the Financing of
the Purchase Price or the Sale Leaseback Financing, other than as set forth in
the Commitment Letters or the Sale Leaseback Agreement. The aggregate proceeds
of the Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any
or all "market flex" provisions related thereto), when funded, together with
the proceeds from the Sale Leaseback Financing, will be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the
Purchase Price on the Closing Date. The respective commitments contained in
the Equity Commitment Letter and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter, have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Each of the
Equity Commitment Letter and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Buyer



and, to the Buyer's knowledge, each other party thereto, to provide the
financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of
the Financing Conditions and except as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any
Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article III and the
representations and warranties set forth on Schedule 3.24, as of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Buyer or, to
Buyer's knowledge, any other party thereto under any of the Commitment
Letters, other than any such default or breach that has been irrevocably
waived by the relevant Financing Sources or the applicable Equity Investor, as
the case may be, or otherwise cured. Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be
paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are required to be
paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in
the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing Conditions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer understands and acknowledges that under the
terms of this Agreement, Buyer's obligation to consummate the acquisition is
not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Buyer's consummation of
any financing arrangements, Buyer's obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Buyer.

Section 4.06. Sale Leaseback Financing. Buyer has delivered to Seller a true,
correct and complete copy of the executed Sale Leaseback Agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit F. The Sale Leaseback Agreement has not been amended or
modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, the Sale Leaseback Agreement is in full force and effect and
represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Buyer and, to the
Buyer's knowledge, the Sale Leaseback Purchaser, to provide the Sale Leaseback
Financing contemplated thereby, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions precedent contained therein and except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally and by general
principles of equity. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in Article III and the representations and
warranties set forth on Schedule 3.24, as of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge,
the Sale Leaseback Purchaser under the Sale Leaseback Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Sale Leaseback Financing, other than as set forth in the Sale
Leaseback Agreement.

Section 4.07. Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending
against or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against, Buyer,
except for such Actions as would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.



Section 4.08. Solvency. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
Assuming that the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately
after the Closing, Buyer and each of its Affiliates (a) will be solvent (in
that both the fair value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its
debts and that the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less
than the amount required to pay its probable Liability on its recourse debts
as they mature or become due); (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity
with which to engage in its business; and (c) will not have incurred and does
not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become
due.

Section 4.09. Finders' Fees. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.10. Inspections; No Other Representations; Non-Reliance. Buyer is an
informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors,
experienced in the evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the
Purchased Assets and the Shares as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has
undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated
such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make
an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has given
Buyer access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the Business.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchased Assets and the Shares are
sold "as is", except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other
agreement or certificate delivered in connection herewith, including the
Transaction Documents. Buyer agrees to accept the Purchased Assets, the
Shares, the Purchased Companies and the Business in the condition they are in
on the Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect to all matters, and Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that
it is not relying on any express or implied representations or warranties of
any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, including the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
or any other agreement or certificate delivered in connection herewith,
including the Transaction Documents, Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer or its Representatives of
future revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof),
future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of
the Business or the future business and operations of the Business.

Section 4.11. Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Shares for
investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the



Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. Buyer
has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby and prior to the Closing Date will have engaged in no
other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations
other than as contemplated herein or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or in the other Transaction Documents.

Section 4.12. Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to Seller the Limited Guaranty dated as
of the date hereof. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a
valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any
Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No event has occurred on or
prior to the date hereof which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of Guarantor under the Limited
Guaranty.

ARTICLE V

Section 5.02. Pre-Closing Access. Subject to confidentiality obligations and
similar restrictions that may be applicable to permitting access to or to
information furnished to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries by third parties
that may be in Seller's or any of its Subsidiaries' possession from time to
time, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall

relating to the Business as such Persons may reasonably request and (c) cause
the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Seller and its Subsidiaries
to cooperate with Buyer and the Sale Leaseback Purchaser in its investigation
of the Business. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of Seller or its Subsidiaries, including, in the case of any such
investigation of Buyer and its Representatives visiting any Restaurant, at
least a twenty-four (24) hour prior notice to Seller and limiting such visits,
at Seller's reasonable discretion, to non-peak business hours at any such
location. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer (and the Sale Leaseback
Purchaser) shall not have access to (A) personnel records of the Business
Employees relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information which would violate applicable Law or which
would reasonably be expected to subject Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
risk of material Liability, (B) any properties of Seller or its Subsidiaries
(whether owned or leased) for purposes of conducting any environmental
sampling or testing or any other invasive sampling or testing, (C) any
information to the extent relating to any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability

with respect to all or portion of the Business, bids received from others in
connection with such sale process or alternative transactions and information
and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids or
alternative transactions, and (ii) as and to the extent necessary to avoid
contravention or waiver, Seller and its Subsidiaries may withhold any document
or information the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to violate
any Contract or any Law or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege
or work-product privilege; provided that to the extent practicable, Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of this subclause
(ii) apply. Seller shall have the right to have a Representative present at
all times during any such inspections, interviews and examinations. Buyer
shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Seller, which may be withheld for any reason, Buyer
shall not contact any employees or consultants of, vendors to, or customers
of, Seller or its Subsidiaries about the Business, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
be permitted to, upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours and
in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of Seller and its Subsidiaries, contact corporate executive-level
Business Employees set forth on Schedule 5.02, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Buyer to implement transition plans to operate the
Business from and after the Closing; provided, that, prior to the Closing, the
consent of Seller shall be required for any discussions relating to
compensation or the terms and conditions of employment.

Section 5.03. Regulatory Filings.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable
under Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the "Regulatory Approvals"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party waives compliance with
the provisions of any bulk transfer or any similar laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Affiliates under the Competition Laws of the jurisdictions set
forth in Schedule 5.03(b) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to comply at
the earliest practicable date with any request under any Competition Law for
additional information, documents, or other materials received by each of them
or any of their respective Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in
respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each
other in connection with any such filing and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under any
Competition Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the other
Party all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, to the extent permitted by Law, responding to any
reasonable requests for copies of documents filed with the non-filing Party's
prior filings). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may, as it deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other Parties under this Section 5.03 as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient Party, and the
recipient Party shall cause such outside counsel not to disclose such
materials or information to any employees, officers, directors or other
representatives of the recipient Party or its Affiliates, unless express
written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials.
Each such Party shall promptly inform the other Party hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
Party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other Party hereto prior notice of the meeting and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto relating to
proceedings under the Competition Laws. Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of
all filing fees in connection with all filings under the Competition Laws.



(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in Section 5.03(b), each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the Competition Laws; provided, that, except with respect to any
inquiries or requests for additional information from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the HSR Act or other Competition Law, if any Action
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Competition Law, each
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required
to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the Competition Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to take any of
the following actions: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition (including by licensing any Intellectual Property Rights) of any
assets of the Business and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in entities with assets or businesses); (ii) terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations; or (iii) otherwise offer
to take or offer to commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets of the
Business and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
entities with assets or businesses). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
agree that Seller's and Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.03 shall not
include any obligation on the part of Buyer, Seller or their respective
Affiliates to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders,
trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its assets or businesses
(including the Business) as may be required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing, delaying or
limiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.04. Permits. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide
all notices and otherwise take all actions to transfer, reissue or obtain any
Permits required to be transferred, reissued or obtained as a result of or in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable and, in any case, prior to Closing, and to the extent necessary,
Buyer and Seller shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to
secure from the applicable Governmental Authority consent to the issuance of
any necessary temporary or provisional Permits required for Buyer's continued
operation of the Restaurants following the Closing. The applications and
related documentation prepared in respect of such Permits, as well as the
choice of entities and transaction structure implemented in relation to
obtaining such Permits, shall be in form and substance reasonably



acceptable to Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith and each
of them shall comply with and carry out any and all commercially reasonable
requirements, demands, requests, rules, and regulations of the local issuing
authority, so as to expedite the approval of the issuance or transfer of such
Permits. To the extent that any Permit has not been obtained prior to Closing,
until such Permits are obtained, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, at either Party's request, to cooperate with each other to
obtain such Permits. During such time period, Seller or the applicable
Retained Subsidiary shall comply with all applicable covenants and obligations
under such Permits, including the payment of any costs or expenses in
connection therewith, which shall be performed by Seller or the applicable
Retained Subsidiary for Buyer's account and Buyer shall promptly (but in no
event later than thirty (30) days following receipt of a reasonably detailed
invoice from Seller (which invoices shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a
monthly basis and shall aggregate all out-of-pocket costs and expenses and
payment of obligations made by Seller in respect of such Permit during such
month, together with reasonable supporting documentation)) reimburse Seller
for any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made by Seller in respect of
such arrangements. During such time period, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable Permit, Buyer shall be entitled
to receive all of the benefits of Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary
under such Permit, and if, during such time period, Buyer would be unable to
operate any portion of a Restaurant due to Seller's retention of such Permit,
Seller shall retain and operate such Restaurant for the benefit of Buyer and
shall provide to Buyer any net profit received from such operations; provided
that any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments that are reimbursed by
Buyer shall not reduce net profit. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the
Seller Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Liabilities based
upon, arising out of or relating to the performance of, or failure to perform,
any obligations under such Permit that are for the benefit of Buyer other than
in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Seller Indemnitees. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, following the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall renew
any Permit upon the expiration or termination thereof if required for Buyer's
continued operation of the applicable Restaurant and, as of such time, there
shall not have been transferred, reissued or obtained a Permit as referred to
in the second sentence of this Section 5.04. In addition, to the extent that
any such Permit contains an "evergreen" provision that automatically renews
such Permit unless terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, Seller and
its Affiliates shall not terminate or cancel such Permit if such Permit is
required for Buyer's continued operation of the applicable Restaurant and, as
of such time, there shall not have been transferred, reissued or obtained a
Permit as referred to in the second sentence of this Section 5.04. Buyer and
Seller shall each bear one half (1/2) of the filing fees with respect to
obtaining any such Permits with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets or the operation of the Business; provided, however, that
neither Party shall be required to incur any further Liabilities or provide
any further financial accommodation in connection therewith.

Section 5.05. Shared Contracts. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to,
cooperate and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Contracts
set forth in Schedule 5.05(a) (collectively, the "Designated Shared
Contracts") to be replaced with separate contract rights and obligations (the
"Replacement Contracts") that provide Buyer or any Purchased Company with
contract rights and obligations (including as to pricing metrics) under the
Designated Shared Contracts that are substantially similar to those contract
rights and obligations (including as to pricing metrics) utilized by Seller in
the



conduct of the Business prior to the Closing. Buyer and Seller shall each bear
one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses associated with first obtaining
and/or entering into any Replacement Contract (e.g., transfer fees, deposits,
etc.); provided, however, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to
incur any further Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation in
connection therewith or in connection with its obligations pursuant to
Backstop Designated Shared Contracts pursuant to this Section 5.05; provided,
further, that Buyer shall be responsible for all ongoing (i.e., going forward,
including payments due at the time of first obtaining and/or entering into any
Replacement Contract intended to cover Buyer's and its Subsidiaries' going
forward costs) costs or fees required to be paid under a Replacement Contract
or Backstop Designated Shared Contract or any alternative arrangements entered
into pursuant to this Section 5.05. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and
provide each other with reasonable assistance in effecting such separation of
the Designated Shared Contracts prior to the Closing and for a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing. In addition, Seller shall,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, for a period of one hundred
eighty days (180) use their reasonable best efforts to cause any Contract with
Coca-Cola Foodservice or its Affiliates to be replaced with a Replacement
Contract that provides Buyer or any Purchased Company with contract rights and
obligations (including as to pricing metrics) that are substantially similar
to those contract rights and obligations (including as to pricing metrics) set
forth in the term sheet regarding such arrangement provided to Buyer prior to
the date hereof, or such other terms as are reasonably requested by Buyer. If
Buyer and Seller are not able to effect the separation of a Designated Shared
Contract (each a "Backstop Designated Shared Contract"), such Backstop
Designated Shared Contract shall be automatically deemed set forth on Schedule
5.05(b) on the Closing Date and, until any such Backstop Designated Shared
Contract is separated or otherwise replaced, but in no event longer than one
hundred eighty (180) days, to the extent permissible under Law and under the
terms of such Backstop Designated Shared Contract, (i) Seller shall continue
to perform the obligations under such Backstop Designated Shared Contract at
the sole cost and expense of Buyer (i.e. Buyer shall promptly, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice
from Seller, reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses or
payments of obligations made by Seller under such Backstop Designated Shared
Contract (which invoices shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly
basis and shall aggregate all out-of-pocket costs and expenses and payment of
obligations made by Seller under all Backstop Designated Shared Contracts
during such month, together with reasonable supporting documentation)), and
Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnitees harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities based upon, arising out of or relating to the
interim arrangements contemplated by this clause (i) with respect to the
Backstop Designated Shared Contracts, except to the extent any such Liability
arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, (ii) Buyer
and Seller shall hold in trust for the benefit of the other Party, and shall
promptly forward to the other Party, any monies or other benefits received
pursuant to such Backstop Designated Shared Contract relating to the
respective businesses of the other Party (or its respective Affiliates) and
(iii) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to institute
alternative arrangements intended to put the Parties in a substantially
similar economic position as if such Backstop Designated Shared Contract were
separated into Replacement Contracts in accordance with this Section 5.05;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, for
a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing, (x) Seller
and its Affiliates shall renew each Designated Shared Contract upon the
expiration or termination thereof if Buyer has not entered into a Replacement
Contract in respect of such Designated Shared Contract,



unless Buyer confirms to Seller in writing that Buyer does not need to receive
the benefit of such Designated Shared Contract, and (y) to the extent any such
Designated Shared Contract contains an "evergreen" provision that
automatically renews such Designated Shared Contract unless terminated or
cancelled by Seller or its Affiliates, Seller and its Affiliates shall not
terminate or cancel such Designated Shared Contract if Buyer has not entered
into a Replacement Contract in respect of such Designated Shared Contract,
unless Buyer confirms to Seller in writing that Buyer does not need to receive
the benefit of such Designated Shared Contract. For a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate to replace any Backstop Designated Shared Contracts to the extent
such Backstop Designated Shared Contracts are not separated or transitioned
hereunder and, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be under no obligation
hereunder to (x) deliver to Buyer the same pricing metrics in any Designated
Shared Contract in connection with obtaining any Replacement Contract in
respect thereof or providing an alternative arrangement with respect to a
Backstop Designated Shared Contract or (y) after the Closing Date to separate
or transition, or provide Buyer with any rights or benefits under, any Shared
Contract that is not a Designated Shared Contract or a Backstop Designated
Shared Contract, as the case may be. With respect to Liabilities pursuant to,
under or relating to a given Backstop Designated Shared Contract, such
Liabilities shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement or a
Replacement Contract, be allocated from time to time between Seller and the
Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Purchased Companies,
on the other hand, as the case may be, based on the relative proportions of
total benefits received (to the extent the Liabilities relate to a specific
period, over such period, and otherwise over the term of the applicable
Backstop Designated Shared Contract, measured up to the date of the
allocation, without duplication) by Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, or Buyer and the Purchased Companies, on the other hand, under
the relevant Backstop Designated Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities
to the extent arising out of or relating to such Party's (or its
Subsidiaries') breach of any such Backstop Designated Shared Contract. It is
acknowledged that for the purposes of this Section 5.05 changes in volume
metrics, as well as changes to reflect the needs of the applicable Party,
shall not be considered when determining whether contract rights and
obligations are "substantially similar."

Section 5.06. Third Party Approvals.

(a) Except with respect to Regulatory Approvals (which are addressed in
Section 5.03), Permits (which are addressed in Section 5.04), the Shared
Contracts (which are addressed in Section 5.05), Liquor Licenses (which are
addressed in Section 5.07) and Business Real Property (which is addressed in
Section 5.25 and Section 5.28), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective controlled
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents,
waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations necessary to transfer and assign
the Non-Assignable Assets (including the Assumed Contracts) (the "Third Party
Approvals") prior to the Closing. To the extent that any Third Party Approval
has not been obtained prior to Closing, for up to one hundred eighty (180)
days following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, at either Party's request, to endeavor to obtain such
Third Party Approvals. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one half (1/2) of the
costs and expenses of obtaining any such Third Party Approvals; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any further Liabilities
or provide any financial



accommodation in connection therewith; provided, further, that Buyer shall be
responsible for all ongoing (i.e., going forward, including payments due at
the time of obtaining any Third Party Approval intended to cover Buyer's and
its Subsidiaries' going forward costs) costs or fees required to be paid under
a Non-Assignable Asset.

(b) In addition, with respect to any Non-Assignable Asset, to the extent
permitted by Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Asset, in the event any
Third Party Approval has not been obtained by Closing, at Buyer's request,
Seller or a Retained Subsidiary shall hold in trust for Buyer the relevant
Non-Assignable Asset until such time as the Third Party Approval is obtained,
but in no event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing. During such time period, Seller or a Retained Subsidiary shall comply
with all applicable covenants and obligations under the Non-Assignable Assets,
including the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which
shall be performed by Seller or a Retained Subsidiary for Buyer's account and
Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days
following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Seller (which invoices
shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly basis and shall aggregate
all such costs or expenses, together with reasonable supporting
documentation)) reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or
payments made by Seller in respect of such Non-Assignable Asset. For the
period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, to
the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Asset, Buyer
shall be entitled to receive all of the benefits of Seller under the Non-
Assignable Asset. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnitees
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities based upon, arising out of
or relating to the performance of, or failure to perform, any obligations
under the Non-Assignable Assets that are for the benefit of Buyer as described
in this Section 5.06, except to the extent such Liabilities arise out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, following the Closing Date, Seller and
its Affiliates shall renew any Non-Assignable Asset upon the expiration or
termination thereof unless, during the period between the Closing Date and one
hundred eighty (180) days thereafter, Buyer has a replacement arrangement
therefor (which shall be determined in Buyer's sole discretion and
communicated to Seller in writing) or Buyer confirms to Seller in writing that
Buyer does not need to receive the benefit of such Non-Assignable Asset. In
addition, to the extent that any Non-Assignable Asset contains an "evergreen"
provision that automatically renews such Non-Assignable Asset unless
terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, Seller and its Affiliates
shall not terminate or cancel such Non-Assignable Asset unless Buyer has a
replacement arrangement therefor (which shall be determined in Buyer's sole
discretion and communicated to Seller in writing), or, during the period
between the Closing Date and one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter, Buyer
confirms to Seller in writing that Buyer does not need to receive the benefit
of such Non-Assignable Asset.

Section 5.07. Liquor Licenses.

(a) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, Seller or its Subsidiaries
have filed or are in the process of filing (and shall file) applications with
the relevant state and local liquor license authorities to transfer the
Assigned Liquor Licenses to the Purchased Subsidiaries. The applications and
related documentation prepared in respect of such Assigned Liquor Licenses
(whether already filed or to be filed), as well as the choice of entities and
transaction structure



implemented in relation to obtaining such Assigned Liquor Licenses, shall be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Upon approval of each
such application by the state and local liquor license authorities (or if such
approval predates the Closing, then, at Seller's discretion, at the Closing)
Seller shall transfer the applicable Assigned Liquor License to Buyer or the
applicable Purchased Subsidiary, or as Buyer otherwise directs. Buyer and
Seller shall reasonably cooperate and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to secure from the applicable licensing authorities any consent
required to (A) the change of control of the Purchased Subsidiaries with
respect to all Assigned Liquor Licenses that have been transferred to the
Purchased Subsidiaries on or prior to Closing, (B) the assignment or transfer
to Buyer or its Affiliates or the Purchased Subsidiaries of the Assigned
Liquor Licenses, and (C) the issuance of any necessary temporary or
provisional Liquor Licenses required for Buyer's continued operation of the
Restaurants after Closing (and Buyer and Seller shall each comply with and
carry out any and all of the commercially reasonable requirements, demands,
requests, rules, and regulations of the state and/or local issuing authority
so as to expedite the approval of the issuance or transfer of such Liquor
Licenses and temporary or provisional Liquor Licenses and shall file all
necessary notifications) and (ii) to obtain the Liquor Licenses required to
operate the Restaurants. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one half (1/2) of
the costs and expenses of obtaining such consents, transferring or assigning
such Assigned Liquor Licenses and/or issuing such temporary or provisional
Liquor Licenses, as applicable; provided, however, that neither Party shall be
required to incur any further Liabilities or provide any further financial
accommodation in connection therewith. Neither Buyer nor Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in violation of Law
applicable to the Liquor Licenses.

(b) To the extent (1) permitted by Law, and (2) required by Law in order to
permit each Restaurant to continue serving liquor, following the Closing Date
and until the earlier of (x) the transfer of any Applied Liquor License to a
Purchased Subsidiary by the relevant liquor license authority or (y) the
issuance by the relevant liquor license authorities of a Liquor License
required for Buyer's continued operation of the Restaurants, Seller shall
enter into reasonable and customary agreements (including one or more Interim
Agreements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller)
whereby Buyer shall appoint Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries to oversee the
purchasing, stocking, selling and serving of alcoholic beverages pursuant to
the Liquor Licenses of Seller and its Subsidiaries on an interim basis until
transition (or issuance, as the case may be) of the Liquor Licenses to Buyer
is complete (the "Interim Agreements"). The Interim Agreements shall provide,
among other terms, that Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold, as applicable,
Seller and Seller Indemnities harmless from and against any and all claims and
Liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs) arising in connection with Buyer's operations under Seller's or its
Subsidiaries' Liquor Licenses (other than liabilities arising out of Seller's
or any Seller Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct) and provide
for the benefit of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries such commercial
general liability insurance coverage against "dram shop" or other Liability
relating to operation of liquor concessions pursuant to the Interim Agreement
as Seller may reasonably require. To the extent that an Interim Agreement is
not permitted by applicable Law to be entered into during such time period,
Seller or a Retained Subsidiary shall retain the operation of any Restaurant
for which a Liquor License has not become an Assigned Liquor License and shall
operate such Restaurant and comply with all applicable covenants and
obligations under such Liquor License, including the payment of any costs or
expenses in connection therewith, which shall be performed by Seller or the
applicable Retained Subsidiary



for Buyer's account and Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from
Seller (which invoices shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly
basis and shall aggregate all out-of-pocket costs and expenses and payment of
obligations made by Seller in respect of such Restaurant or Liquor License
during such month, together with reasonable supporting documentation))
reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made by
Seller in respect of such arrangement. During such time period, Buyer shall be
entitled to receive all of the benefits of Seller under such Liquor License
and in respect of the operation of such Restaurant, and Seller shall provide
to Buyer any net profit received from such operations; provided that any out-
of-pocket costs, expenses or payments that are reimbursed by Buyer shall not
reduce net profit.

Section 5.08. Post-Closing Asset Transfers. In the event that at any time or
from time to time after the Closing Date, Seller or any of its Retained
Subsidiaries receives or otherwise possesses any Purchased Asset or other
property or asset that should belong to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
Seller shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to
Buyer, for no additional consideration. Prior to any such transfer, Seller
shall hold such property or asset in trust for the benefit of Buyer. In the
event that at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer or
its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies, receives or otherwise
possess any Excluded Asset or other property or asset that should belong to
Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer
shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such property or asset to
Seller or the appropriate Retained Subsidiary, for no additional
consideration.

Section 5.09. Intercompany Balance. Seller shall cause all intercompany
balances between and among the Purchased Companies, on the one hand, and
Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or otherwise
with respect to the Business, to be eliminated, by discharge or otherwise,
and, except for those transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, all intercompany transactions and accounts to be
terminated and cancelled, in each case, effective as of the Closing, with no
further Liability or obligation on the part of Seller, the Retained Companies,
Buyer or the Purchased Companies.

Section 5.10. Business Guarantees.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the respective
beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, on or
before the Closing, valid and binding written unconditional releases of Seller
and its Affiliates, as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before,
on or after the Closing Date, under the Business Guarantees set forth on
Schedule 1.01(c) as such schedule may be amended from time to time before, on
or after the Closing Date with respect to the Lease Guarantees (the "Listed
Business Guarantees"), which releases shall be effective as of the Closing;
provided, however, that this Section 5.10(a) shall not require Buyer to obtain
any new or replacement letter of credit, comfort letter, bond, surety or other
credit support or otherwise post any similar security obligation or (directly,
or indirectly as a result of the release occurring) incur any cost or expense
in connection with such efforts.



(b) If any Listed Business Guarantee has not been released as of the Closing
Date, (i) Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to cause such
unreleased Listed Business Guarantees to be released; provided, however, that
this clause (i) shall not require Buyer to obtain any new or replacement
letter of credit, comfort letter, bond, surety or other credit support or
otherwise post any similar security obligation or (directly, or indirectly as
a result of the release occurring) incur any cost or expense in connection
with such efforts, (ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Indemnitees for any amounts required to be paid under such Listed Business
Guarantees and which are not due to Seller's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and (iii) Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to (A) renew or extend the term of (B) increase its obligations
under or (C) transfer to another third party the Contract, Lease or other
obligation underlying an unreleased Listed Business Guarantee for which Seller
or any Retained Subsidiary is or would reasonably be expected to be liable;
provided that Buyer shall be entitled to renew a Lease pursuant to the
exercise of an option with respect to such Lease existing on the Closing Date.
To the extent that Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries have performance
obligations under any Listed Business Guarantee, Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) perform such obligations on behalf of Seller and the
Retained Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by Seller so as to put Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries in the
same position as if Buyer, and not Seller or a Retained Subsidiary, had
performed or were performing such obligations; provided, however, that Buyer
shall not be required to obtain any new or replacement letter of credit,
comfort letter, bond, surety or other credit support or otherwise post any
similar security obligation or (directly, or indirectly as a result of the
release occurring) incur any cost or expense in connection with such efforts.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, (i) Seller and the
Retained Subsidiaries may, in such Person's sole discretion, take any action
to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit its Liability under any and
all outstanding Listed Business Guarantees to the extent such action does not
increase Buyer's or any of its Affiliates', including any Purchased Company's,
Liabilities or obligations under the Contract, Lease or instrument to which
such Listed Business Guarantee relates (including by requiring Buyer to obtain
or issue a security obligation in replacement of such Listed Business
Guarantee) or otherwise materially and adversely impacts Buyer's or its
Affiliates' (including such Purchased Company's) relationship with the
counterparty thereunder (including any landlord under any Lease) and (ii)
Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries shall renew any Listed Business Guarantee
after the expiration of any such arrangement if Buyer does not have a
replacement therefor (which shall be determined in Buyer's sole discretion and
communicated to Seller in writing), unless Buyer confirms to Seller in writing
that Buyer does not need to receive the benefit of such arrangement (but
subject to Buyer's agreement to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 5.10(d) below).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees from and after the Closing for any amounts required to be
paid under any Business Guarantees or Lease Guarantees to the extent such
amounts and are not due to Seller's gross negligence or willful misconduct.



Section 5.11. Notices. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall give Seller, and
Seller shall give Buyer, prompt written notice of (i) any known development
that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Article VIII, and (ii) any material Action threatened against such
Party related to the transactions contemplated hereby. No delivery of any
notice under Section 5.11 shall be deemed to cure any breach or affect any
remedies available to a Party hereunder.

Section 5.12. Trademark Matters.

(d) Except to the extent permitted in accordance with this Section 5.12 or
except to the extent permitted in accordance with the Gift Card Agreement, (i)
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not use or display any of the Trademarks used
or held for use in connection with the Retained Business, including any
Trademarks containing the element "Darden" (the "Seller Marks"), and (ii)
Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries shall not use or display any of the
Trademarks constituting Business Intellectual Property, including the
Trademarks listed on Schedule 3.13(a) (the "Business Marks" and, together with
the Seller Marks, the "Marks").

(e) For a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates shall have the right to (i) maintain signage (including signs on
buildings and vehicles) bearing any Business Marks that exists as of the
Closing in substantially the same manner such signage was used in the Retained
Business prior to Closing, and (ii) continue to use business cards,
stationery, and similar materials bearing the Business Marks that exist as of
the Closing in substantially the same manner such materials were used in the
Retained Business prior to Closing; provided, however, that as promptly as
reasonably practicable after Closing, but in no event after the end of such
six (6) month period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease
and discontinue any use of the Business Marks.

(f) For a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates operating the Business shall have the right to (i) maintain signage
(including signs on buildings and vehicles) bearing any Seller Marks that
exists as of the Closing in substantially the same manner such signage was
used in the Business prior to Closing, and (ii) continue to use business
cards, stationery, and similar materials bearing the Seller Marks that exist
as of the Closing in substantially the same manner such materials were used in
the Business prior to Closing; provided, however, that as promptly as
reasonably practicable after Closing, but in no event after the end of such
six (6) month period, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to cease and
discontinue any use of the Seller Marks.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, following
the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall not be deemed to have breached this Section
5.12 by reason of the appearance of the Business Marks on any historical
memorabilia retained by Seller and its Affiliates (whether physical or
virtual/electronic); and (ii) neither Party shall be deemed to have breached
this Section 5.12 by reason of (v) the use of existing stocks of office
supplies, stationery, and similar materials bearing the Marks of the other
Party to exhaust such stocks and the use of manuals, handbooks, guidelines and
similar materials bearing the Marks of the other Party that exist as of the
Closing, in each case, for internal purposes only, (w) the appearance of the
Marks of the other Party in print or digital location services or other
directories or in or on any third party's publications (in each case, in
whatever format or medium) distributed, posted or ordered to be printed in the



ordinary course of business prior to the Closing Date, and that are generally
available to the public, or any other similar uses by any such third party
over which such first Party and its Affiliates have no control, (x) the use of
the Marks of the other Party in a non-trademark manner for the sole purpose of
conveying to customers or the general public the historical origins of their
businesses, (y) the use of the Marks on materials where the right to revoke
the license or permission does not exist or cannot be readily effected by the
applicable Party (such as websites controlled by third parties, client
references or case studies, or shared billboards or other shared structures),
or (z) the use of the Marks of the other Party to the extent required under
applicable Law or pursuant to recorded documents.

Section 5.13. Insurance.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, continue to carry their
respective insurance policies with respect to the Business prior to the
Closing. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchased Companies shall cease
to be insured by Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of
their self-insured programs. Seller or its Affiliates may, to be effective at
the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner they deem appropriate
to give effect to this Section 5.13(a). From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for
its operation of the Purchased Companies and the Business and for promptly
providing evidence thereof, as may be required, to third parties under any
Contract or Lease.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to assert claims arising
from or relating to facts, circumstances, events or matters that occurred
prior to the Closing and that constitute the Assumed Liabilities under any
applicable insurance policies of Seller (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any policies issued by Seller's captive insurance program) or its
Affiliates in effect on or prior to the Closing Date relating to the Business
or the Purchased Companies, to the extent permitted under such insurance
policies and subject to the applicable deductibles, up to the full available
limits of such policies. Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to report such claims
directly to the provider of such insurance policies; provided that Buyer shall
report such claims simultaneously to Seller. At Buyer's request, and subject
at all times to Buyer's direction and control, Seller and its Affiliates shall
participate and assist in Buyer's efforts to pursue insurance coverage through
litigation or other action against an insurer; provided that Buyer shall be
solely responsible for its own costs and fees in connection therewith. Seller
and its Affiliates shall be entitled to copies of all documents and
correspondence related to such claims and to discuss the status of such claims
with the provider of the applicable insurance policies. Buyer shall be
entitled to settle or compromise any claim for which it is seeking insurance
coverage in excess of the deductible under such insurance policies, provided
that Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities incurred in
connection therewith. Seller and its Affiliates shall have no Liability to
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies) whatsoever
(except for a breach of Section 5.13 hereof and subject to the limitations set
forth in Article IX) as a result of the insurance policies and practices of
Seller and its Affiliates as in effect at any time, including as a result of
the level or scope of any such insurance, the creditworthiness of any
insurance carrier, the terms and conditions of any policy, or the adequacy or
timeliness of any notice to any insurance carrier with respect to any claim or
potential claim or otherwise.



Section 5.14. Legal Proceedings; Production of Witnesses; Privileged Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, (i) except to the extent that Buyer is
seeking indemnification, in which case the provisions of Article IX shall
govern, Buyer shall have exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, prosecution, defense, and appeal of all Actions to the extent
covering or relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and,
subject to Section 5.13(b), may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to any such Action, and (ii) Seller shall have
exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution, defense,
and appeal of all Actions referred to in Section 2.05(k) and all other Actions
to the extent covering or relating to the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Liabilities, and may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any such Action without the consent of Buyer;
provided that, to the extent any Action retained by Seller relates to or
arises out of, in whole or in part, the Business, Seller shall not settle or
compromise, or consent to any judgment in respect of, such Action without
Buyer's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless in connection therewith Seller obtains a complete and
unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim against
or relating to the Business and the Buyer and its Affiliates affected by the
claim, and such settlement or judgment does not contain any admission by, or
sanction or restriction upon the conduct or operation of the Business or the
Buyer or its Affiliates (including any settlement or judgment that includes
injunctive or other equitable relief (including involving or relating to a
change in business practices)). Without limiting the foregoing, if any Action
involves both any Assumed Liability and/or any Purchased Asset, on the one
hand, and any Excluded Asset and/or any Excluded Liability, on the other,
then, the Parties and their respective applicable Subsidiaries shall cooperate
in good faith in the investigation, prosecution, defense, and appeal of such
Action. Furthermore, Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) and Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall enter into a written joint defense agreement in a
form reasonably acceptable to such parties with respect to any Action,
including Actions listed on Schedule 2.05(k), as Buyer or Seller may
reasonably request.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other and their respective counsel, including by making available to each
other, upon reasonable written request, their (and their Subsidiaries')
respective officers, directors, employees, and agents for fact finding,
consultation, and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any such
Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which the
requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct of
the Business or the Retained Businesses, prior to or after the Closing. Access
to such Persons shall be granted during normal business hours at a location
and in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
Business and the Retained Businesses, as applicable. Seller and Buyer agree to
reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, but excluding
officers' or employees' salaries, incurred by the other Party in connection
with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to this Section 5.14.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with Section 5.14(a) or Section 5.14(b). For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Party shall have an obligation to cooperate, make available
personnel or disclose any documents or other information pursuant to



Section 5.14(a) or Section 5.14(b), Section 9.03 or Article VI, if Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in any Action and such assistance,
testimony, documents or other information is reasonably pertinent thereto;
provided, further, that this shall not limit in any respect any rights a Party
may have with respect to discovery or the production of documents or other
information in connection with any such Action.

(d) The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert, or waive any attorney-client and work product
privileges belonging to either Party with respect to the Business and the
Retained Businesses (collectively, "Privileges"), shall be governed by the
provisions of this Section 5.14(d) and Section 2.03(s). With respect to
matters relating to the Retained Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the
Excluded Liabilities, in each case regardless of whether such matters also
relate to the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities, and
with respect to all business records, documents, communications, or other
information (collectively, "Information") of Seller or any Affiliate prepared
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
Seller shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or waive any
Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege against Buyer and its
Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the
Purchased Companies) shall take no action without the prior written consent of
Seller that would reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such
Privileges of Seller. After the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority to
determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with respect to matters
relating to the Business (except for the Excluded Liabilities, Information
prepared in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or matters that relate to the
Retained Businesses, the Excluded Assets, or the Excluded Liabilities).
However, Buyer may not assert any such Privileges of Buyer related to pre-
Closing advice or communications relating to the Business against Seller and
its Affiliates; provided, however, that, to the extent any waiver (or failure
to assert such Privilege) would reasonably be expected to result in such
Privilege being waived in connection with any claim by a third party in
connection with the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into such reasonable arrangements designed to ensure that such Privilege
is not otherwise waived with respect to such third party, including customary
joint defense agreements or similar arrangements. Seller and its Affiliates
shall take no action after the Closing without the prior written consent of
Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such
Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created by this Section
5.14(d) shall apply to all Information as to which Seller, its Affiliates or
the Purchased Companies would be entitled to assert or has asserted a
Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Privileged Information"). Upon receipt by Seller or
its Affiliates, or Buyer and its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing
Date, the Purchased Companies), as the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery
or other request from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information of the other or if Seller
or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing
Date, the Purchased Companies), as the case may be, obtains knowledge that any
current or former employee of Seller, its Affiliates or the Purchased
Companies or Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the
Purchased Companies), has received any subpoena, discovery or other request
from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Information of the other Party, such Party shall
promptly notify the other of the existence of the request and



shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and
to assert any rights it may have under this Section 5.14(d) or otherwise to
prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged Information. Seller's
transfer of any Business Records or other Information to Buyer in accordance
with this Agreement and Seller's agreement to permit Buyer to obtain
Information existing prior to the Closing are made in reliance on the Parties'
respective agreements, as set forth in this Section 5.14(d), to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps provided herein for
the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to Business Records and other
Information being granted pursuant to Section 5.02, Section 5.14, Section
5.15, and Section 9.03 and Article VI, the agreement to provide witnesses and
individuals pursuant to this Section 5.14 and the disclosure to Buyer and
Seller of Privileged Information relating to the Business or the Retained
Businesses pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be asserted by Seller or Buyer to constitute, or
otherwise be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be
asserted under this Section 5.14(d) or otherwise.

Section 5.15. Books and Records; Post-Closing Access.

(f) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in no event later than
sixty (60) days after Closing, as permitted by Law, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
all Business Records then in the possession of Seller or any Retained
Subsidiary. The foregoing shall be limited by the following specific
provisions:

(i) To the extent any document (other than that stored on electronic media)
can be subdivided without unreasonable effort and at no or nominal cost into
two portions, one of which constitutes a Business Record and the other of
which does not, such document (other than that stored on electronic media)
shall be so subdivided, and the original or copy of the portion of such
document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes a
Business Record shall be provided to Buyer;

(ii) To the extent that any files or documents constituting Business Records
are mixed together with any documents or files that are not Business Records
in a way that prevents their separation without unreasonable effort and at no
or nominal cost into two portions, Seller shall not be required to perform
such separation unless specifically requested by Buyer and then at Buyer's
sole cost and expense; provided, that Seller shall, promptly upon determining
that such separation would involve unreasonable effort or cost, advise Buyer
of the same and afford Buyer the opportunity to determine whether Buyer wishes
to request that Seller perform such separation in accordance with this clause
(ii);

(iii) Seller shall not be required to deliver to Buyer books and records or
portions thereof (i) if such delivery would violate any applicable Law or (ii)
which are subject to confidentiality agreements which would by their terms
prohibit such delivery; provided, however, if requested by Buyer, Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver of such
confidentiality restriction; provided, further, that Seller shall, promptly
upon determining that such delivery would violate applicable Law or any
confidentiality agreement, advise Buyer of the same and afford Buyer the
opportunity to



determine whether Buyer wishes to request that Seller seek a waiver of such
confidentiality restriction in accordance with this clause (iv);

(iv) Seller may refuse to furnish any Information if it believes in good faith
that doing so presents, based on an advice of outside counsel, a significant
risk of loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of legal privilege
or work-product privilege; provided that the Parties shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information without
resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege; and

(v) Seller may redact any Information covered by this Section 5.15 as and to
the extent such Information relates to the Retained Businesses, the Excluded
Assets or the Excluded Liabilities.

(g) Buyer agrees to hold at least one copy of all Business Records that
constitute Purchased Assets and all Business Records of the Purchased
Companies and not to destroy or dispose of such copy for a period of six (6)
years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law, and
if thereafter Buyer proposes to destroy or dispose of such copy, Buyer shall
offer first in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such proposed
destruction or disposition to surrender all or any portion of such Business
Records to Seller upon Seller's request.

(h) From and after the Closing, except as prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies, to
(i) give Seller and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and on reasonable advance written notice to the offices,
properties and Business Records of Buyer and its Affiliates, including the
Purchased Companies, relating to the Business and operations of the Purchased
Companies on or before the Closing Date, (ii) furnish to Seller and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Business and the operations of the Purchased Companies on or
before the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the employees, counsel and financial
advisors of Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies, to
reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Representatives, in each case, to the
extent reasonably requested by Seller in connection with accounting, Tax and
other similar needs. From and after the Closing, except as prohibited by
applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries, to
(A) give Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and on reasonable advance written notice to the offices,
properties and Business Records of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries
relating to the Business on or before the Closing Date, (B) furnish to Buyer
and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Business on or before the Closing Date, and (C)
cause the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Seller and the Retained
Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives, in
each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
accounting, Tax and other similar needs (including in connection with Buyer's
preparation of audited financial statements of the Business for the 2014
fiscal year). Any such access shall be granted in a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Party granting such
access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may withhold such access,
as and to the extent necessary to avoid contravention or waiver, to any
document or information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected
to violate



any Contract or any Law or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege
or work-product privilege; provided that to the extent practicable and in
accordance with such Contract or Law, and in a manner that does not result of
the waiver of any such privilege, such Party shall make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
these restrictions apply; provided, further, that nothing in this Section
5.15(c) shall limit in any respect any rights any Party may have with respect
to discovery or the production of documents or other information in connection
with any litigation.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with this Section 5.15.

Section 5.16. Confidentiality.

(gg) After the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
and Retained Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of the
longer of (a) three (3) years after the Closing Date and (b) until such
information no longer constitutes a trade secret under applicable Law, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose to any third party (other than
each other and their respective Representatives) any confidential information
included in the Purchased Assets; provided that the foregoing restriction
shall not (a) apply to any information that (i) is or becomes generally
available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in
violation of this Section 5.16(a)), (ii) is or becomes generally available to
Seller from a source other than Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives,
provided that such source is not known by Seller to be bound by a duty of
confidentiality with Buyer or its Affiliates, or (iii) Seller can establish
was independently developed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than by
the Business prior to the Closing), without use of any confidential
information included in the Purchased Assets, or (b) prohibit any disclosure
(i) required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable national
securities exchange so long as, to the extent legally permissible, Seller
provides Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a
reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure or (ii) necessary to be made
in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to any of
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(hh) After the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of the longer of
(a) three (3) years after the Closing Date and (b) until such information no
longer constitutes a trade secret under applicable Law, without the prior
written consent of Seller, disclose to any third party (other than each other
and their respective Representatives) any confidential information with
respect to the Retained Businesses or included in the Excluded Assets;
provided that the foregoing restriction shall not (a) apply to any information
that (i) is or becomes generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section 5.16(b) or any
other confidentiality obligations owed to Seller), (ii) is or becomes
generally available to Buyer from a source other than Seller or its Affiliates
or Representatives, provided that such source is not known by Buyer to be
bound by a duty of confidentiality with Seller or its Affiliates, or (iii)
Buyer can establish was independently developed by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (other than by the Business prior to the Closing), without use of
any confidential information with respect to the Retained Businesses or



included in the Excluded Assets, or (b) prohibit any disclosure (i) required
by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable national securities
exchange so long as, to the extent legally permissible, Buyer provides Seller
with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity
to contest such disclosure or (ii) necessary to be made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to any of the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by
the execution of this Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall deliver written notice to each
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) that signed a
confidentiality agreement with Seller in connection with any actual or
potential proposal by such Person to acquire the Business to promptly return
or destroy all confidential information delivered thereunder to the extent
required by such confidentiality agreement (to the extent Seller has not
already done so).

Section 5.17. Public Announcements. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf
of any Party without the prior consent of the other Party, except that (i)
Seller and Buyer may make announcements as they may reasonably determine is
necessary to comply with applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange, (ii) each of Seller and its Subsidiaries may
make announcements from time to time to their respective employees, customers,
suppliers and other business relations; provided that, with respect to the
Business, to the extent practicable, Seller shall try in good faith to remain
within the bounds of Seller's prior disclosures; and (iii) Seller may file a
proxy statement pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 describing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make announcements with
respect to the Business and the transactions contemplated hereby in connection
therewith, in each case as it may reasonably determine is necessary or
desirable; provided, further, that, such Party shall consult with and agree on
the language of any such announcement with the other Party prior to any such
announcement to the extent reasonably practicable (and, in the case of the
proxy statement and related announcements, Seller shall only be required to
consult with Buyer and reasonably consider any comments Buyer may have to such
proxy statement) and shall in any event promptly provide the other Party with
copies of any such announcement or proxy, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release
to be issued on or promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
after the date of this Agreement and a joint press release to be issued on the
Closing Date.

Section 5.18. Non-solicit.

(r) From the date hereof through a period of three (3) years following the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, to solicit (or cause to be directly or
indirectly solicited) or hire any Business Employee who becomes a Transferred
Employee; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i)
Transferred Employees who are involuntarily terminated by Buyer, (ii)
generalized searches by use of advertising or recruiting efforts (including
the use of search firms) which are not specifically targeted at such

title of Vice President or above who become Transferred Employees), or (iii)
hourly restaurant-level employees.

(s) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Purchased Companies), directly or indirectly, to solicit (or
cause to be directly or indirectly solicited) or hire any employee of Seller
or its Retained Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (other
than the Business Employees); provided that the foregoing restriction shall
not apply to (i) any such employees who are involuntarily terminated by Seller
or its Retained Subsidiaries, (ii) generalized searches by use of advertising
or recruiting efforts (including the use of search firms) which are not
specifically targeted at such employees or hiring that results therefrom
(provided, that the exception contained in this clause (ii) shall not apply to
employees of the Seller or its Retained Subsidiaries having a title of Vice
President or above), (iii) hourly restaurant-level employees or (iv) the
individuals set forth on Schedule 5.18(b).

Section 5.19. Resignations. Seller shall, and shall cause each Equity Seller

Section 5.20. [Reserved]

Section 5.21. Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Debt Financing and the Sale Leaseback Financing as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and (y)
consummate the Debt Financing and the Sale Leaseback Financing on the Closing
Date, including using its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permit or consent to
any amendment or modification to be made to, not consent to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replace, the Debt Commitment Letter, if
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) to an amount that would
cause Buyer to not have sufficient funds to pay the Purchase Price and to pay
all fees and expenses required to be paid by the Buyer relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and after giving effect
to any increase in the amount of the Equity Financing or (B) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (2)
make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt



Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto when
required pursuant to this Agreement (provided that Buyer may (I) amend,
restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to (x) (i)
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, (ii) remove lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities who executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, or (iii) to reallocate commitments or change, assign or reassign
titles, duties or roles to, or between or among, any entities party thereto,
(y) amend the economic or other arrangements with respect to the existing and
additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities, or (II) make any changes in connection with any "market flex"
provisions contemplated by any fee letter related to the Debt Financing (a
"Fee Letter"), in each case, if such addition of additional parties, such
removal of parties, such reallocation, such assignment, such reassignment,
such amendment or such changes (x) do not reduce the Debt Financing to be
funded at the Closing, (y) do not result in additional conditions or
contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing or modify in a manner
adverse, in any material respect, to Buyer the conditions to funding set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter, or (z) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing;

(ii) cause the Equity Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the
Financing Conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letter;

(iii) satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date all Financing Conditions that
are within Buyer's control;

(iv) negotiate, execute and deliver Debt Financing Documents that reflect the
terms consistent, in all material respects, with the terms contained in, or
such other terms that are not materially less favorable to Buyer in the
aggregate than, the Debt Commitment Letter;

(v) if necessary to achieve a Successful Syndication (as such term is defined
in the Fee Letter), accept to the fullest extent all modifications to the Debt
Financing provided in the "market flex" provisions contemplated by the Fee
Letter;

(vi) in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section
8.02 and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, immediately upon
funding would be satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to fund the full
amount of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (or such lesser amount
as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby);

(vii) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters in the event of a
Financing Failure Event to the extent, in the case of the Debt Commitment
Letter, such Financing Failure Event results from a breach of the Debt
Commitment Letter by the Financing Sources;



(viii) maintain in effect and not terminate the Sale Leaseback Agreement and
not permit or consent to any amendment or modification to be made to the Sale
Leaseback Agreement that is materially adverse to the Buyer;

(ix) satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date all SLB Conditions that are
within Buyer's control and required to be satisfied on or prior to the Closing
Date;

(x) in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section
8.02 and the SLB Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
immediately satisfied, cause (including by enforcing its rights under the Sale
Leaseback Agreement) the Sale Leaseback Purchaser to consummate the
transactions under the Sale Leaseback Agreement simultaneously with the
Closing hereunder; and

(xi) enforce its rights under the Sale Leaseback Agreement Letters in the
event of a Financing Failure Event, to the extent such Financing Failure Event
results from a breach of the Sale Leaseback Agreement by the Sale Leaseback
Purchaser.

(b) Buyer, upon the written request of Seller, shall keep Seller informed in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
the Sale Leaseback Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice of any
breach or repudiation or other Financing Failure Event, or receipt of a
written notice of any anticipated or asserted breach or repudiation or other
Financing Failure Event, by any party to the Commitment Letters or the Sale
Leaseback Agreement of which Buyer or its Affiliate becomes aware, if such
breach or repudiation would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
Closing Date. Without limiting Buyer's other obligations under this Section
5.21, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify
Seller of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) in
consultation with Seller, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative financing sources (the
"Alternative Financing"), in an amount sufficient to pay the Purchase Price at
the Closing and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise in accordance with Section 5.21(a), as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, and (iii) when obtained, provide
Seller with a copy of, a replacement financing commitment, if any, in
accordance with Section 5.21(a)(i) that provides for such Alternative
Financing, if applicable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
no event shall Buyer (in its sole discretion) be required to (i) pay any fees
in the aggregate in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
or (ii) agree to terms that are outside of, or less favorable than any terms
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (including any
"market flex" provision therein). Seller agrees to provide all reasonable
cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
the arrangement of any such Alternative Financing on a basis consistent
Section 5.22 hereof (as though such Alternative Financing were the Debt
Financing and any commitment letter thereunder were the Debt Commitment
Letter).

Section 5.22. Debt Financing Cooperation.

(a) Seller shall, and shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, provide such cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt



Financing as is reasonably requested by Buyer; provided that Seller and its
Affiliates shall in no event be required to provide such assistance that shall
unreasonably interfere with their respective business operations. Such
assistance shall include, without limitation, the following, each of which
shall be at Buyer's request with reasonably practicable prior notice and at
Buyer's sole cost and expense:

(i) furnishing Buyer and its Financing Sources as promptly as practicable with
(x) the financial statements and pro forma financial information referred to
in the Commitment Letters (as in effect as of the date hereof) and (y) such
other pertinent and customary financial and other information customarily
delivered in connection with Buyer's preparation of a customary bank book,
confidential information memorandum, lender presentations, business
projections and similar documents for financings that are similar to the Debt
Financing and other marketing materials customarily used in connection with
the syndication of financings that are similar to the Debt Financing
reasonably requested by Buyer (including with respect to acquired entities) in

out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with such cooperation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that the condition set forth in Section 8.02(a), as applied to Seller's
obligations under this Section 5.22, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless
the Financing or the Sale Leaseback Financing has not been obtained as a
result of Sellers's breach of its obligations under this Section 5.22 to the
extent such breach impairs or adversely affects the Financing or the Sale
Leaseback Financing, including the execution, timing and pricing or cost
thereof, in a material manner. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining
the Financing and the Sale Leaseback Financing are not conditions to Closing.
None of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any obligations under this
Section 5.22 following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 5.23. Business Employees. One (1) day prior to the Closing Date,

Closing Date and confirming that, to the knowledge of such lessor, the lessee
is not in default of its obligations under any such Material Leases
(collectively, the "Material Lease Estoppel Certificates"), and shall request
that such lessors complete and sign the Material Lease Estoppel Certificates
and return them to Seller within ten (10) days after their receipt of the same
or within the time period set forth in such Material Lease, as the case may
be. In addition, to the extent a Material Lease Estoppel Certificate is not
dated within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall accept
from Seller an estoppel certificate that updates such Material Lease Estoppel
Certificate for the period from the expiration of such 90-day period until the
Closing Date. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Buyer an executed Material Lease Estoppel Certificate from the
lessors under the Material Leases prior to the date that is thirty (30) days
after the date hereof (the "Estoppel Outside Date"), but in any event shall
deliver the same to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof and shall deliver the
Material Lease Estoppel Certificates for all of the Material Lease Real
Property; provided, however, that (x) in no event shall Seller be required to
institute legal proceedings against such lessors in connection therewith, and
(y) to the extent Seller is unable to obtain Estoppel Certificates for all of
the Material Leased Real Property prior to the Closing Date, then, in lieu of
the Material Lease Estoppel Certificate, Buyer will accept an estoppel
certificate from Seller that covers the matters that would have been covered
in the Material Lease Estoppel Certificate (each, a "Seller Estoppel"). In
addition to the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event
that Seller receives a Material Lease Estoppel Certificate after the Closing
Date with respect to any Material Lease Real Property for which a Seller
Estoppel was previously delivered, then in such event Buyer shall return to
Seller the Seller Estoppel with respect to such Leases.

Section 5.26. Title Insurance and Surveys. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and the Sale Leaseback Purchaser in
obtaining the Title Policies in form and substance as set forth in Section
2.08(d) of this Agreement, including, without limitation, removing from title
any liens or encumbrances which are not Permitted Liens. Seller shall provide
the Title Company with any affidavit, indemnity or other assurances reasonable
and customarily requested by the Title Company to issue the Title Policies.

half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Seller when due, and the party
required by applicable Law shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.02. Property Taxes for Straddle Tax Periods. All Property Taxes
levied (and refunds received) with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
assets of any Disregarded Subsidiary Company for the Straddle Tax Period, and
all contingent expenses paid to consultants for appealing such Property Taxes,
shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days of
such Straddle Tax Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number
of days of such Straddle Tax Period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period.
Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall receive any
refunds attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period. Within ten (10) days after the end of each

statement to the other Party setting forth any Property Tax bills received by
such Party during the quarter, the amount of contingent expenses (if any)
incurred in appealing such Property Taxes and a calculation of the amount of
reimbursement to which each Party is entitled under this Section 6.02 for the
quarter, taking into account payments for Property Taxes made by Seller prior
to Closing, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary
to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the
Party owing it to the other Party within ten (10) days after delivery of such
statement. In the event that Buyer or Seller is entitled to reimbursement for
an amount paid under this Section 6.02, the applicable Party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten (10) days after the
presentation of a quarterly statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement. To the extent either Party or an Affiliate thereof receives a

each Party is entitled under this Section 6.02, the amount of contingent
expenses (if any) incurred in appealing such Property Taxes (to the extent not
previously taken into account above), and such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount
shall be paid by the Party owing it to the other Party within ten (10) days
after delivery of such statement.

Section 6.03. Cooperation On Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
fully, and Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates, including the Purchased
Companies, to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Party, in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to Section 6.04(a) and any audit, examination, inquiry,
claim for refund, lawsuit, action, claim, arbitration, mediation or other
proceeding at law or in equity by or before a Taxing Authority with respect to
Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or of the Purchased Companies with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each a "Tax Claim"). Such cooperation
shall include access to records and information which are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return or Tax Claim, making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder and executing powers of attorney. Seller and Buyer
shall, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates, including the Purchased
Companies, to (a) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to



the Business, the Purchased Assets and the operations of the Purchased
Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period for four (4) years following
the Closing Date and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority, and (b) to give the other Party reasonable notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other Party so requests, Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall
cause its Affiliates, including the Purchased Companies, to, allow the other
Party to take possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to transfer to
Buyer any Tax Returns or other Tax work papers of Seller or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries. Buyer and Seller each agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax (including any Transfer Taxes) that could be
imposed, including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.04. Purchased Company Tax Returns and Refunds.

(a) Seller, at its own cost and expense, shall prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all Income Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (excluding any Straddle Period) that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date and shall pay any Income Taxes
reflected as due on such Income Tax Returns. Seller shall submit all
standalone Income Tax Returns of the Purchased Companies to Buyer (together
with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer,
supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including any applicable extension) of such return for review, comment and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Seller shall make any changes to any such Income Tax Returns that
are reasonably requested by Buyer at least ten (10) days prior to the
applicable due date (including any applicable extension) of such return.
Seller shall submit to Buyer pro forma federal Income Tax Returns of the
Purchased Companies and, as requested by Buyer, shall prepare and submit to
Buyer pro forma state Income Tax Returns of the Purchased Companies in states
where unitary or consolidated returns are filed (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, supporting
documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any
applicable extension) of such return for review and comment, and Seller shall
consider in good faith any changes to such pro forma Income Tax Returns that
are reasonably requested by Buyer at least ten (10) days prior to the
applicable due date (including any applicable extension) of such return.

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed when due
(taking into account any extensions of a required filing date) all other Tax
Returns of the Purchased Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
a Straddle Tax Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date
(each a "Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return"). Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice and shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller
(together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested
by Seller, supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date (including any applicable extension) of such return. Seller shall
have the right to review, comment on and approve (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) all Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax
Returns, and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall make
any changes to any such Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed



Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by Seller at least ten (10) days
prior to the applicable due date (including any applicable extension) of such
return. With respect to Taxes (other than Property Taxes, which shall be
allocated in accordance with Section 6.02) of the Purchased Companies relating
to a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period will be determined as
though the taxable year of each Purchased Company terminated at the close of
business on the Closing Date.

(c) Except to the extent otherwise required under applicable Law, no Income
Tax Return or any other material Tax Return of any Purchased Company shall be
amended for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period without the
prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, with respect to all other Tax Returns of a Purchased Company for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period, Seller shall not be liable
for any Taxes or increased Tax Liability incurred as a result of an amendment
by Buyer or its Affiliates of such other Tax Return of any Purchased Company
unless, for the avoidance of doubt, required under applicable Law or with
respect to an amendment for which Seller's consent was sought pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

(d) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refund (whether such
refund arises by way of payment, credit, offset or reduction in Tax Liability)
of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent such
refund is attributable to any Tax attribute arising in a Post-Closing Tax
Period) and statutory interest thereon (any such refund, a "Pre-Closing Tax
Refund") that is received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Purchased
Companies and that is attributable to Taxes of the Purchased Companies paid by
Seller, the Purchased Companies or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller no
later than ten (10) days following receipt of such refund, in each case net of
any Taxes imposed thereon and any corresponding Damages associated with
collecting or receiving such refunds.

Section 6.05. Buyer Covenants. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
Buyer covenants that it shall not cause or permit any Purchased Company to
make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code for any of the Purchased
Companies.

Section 6.06. Tax Sharing. Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements, except
for this Agreement, between any Purchased Company and any member of the Seller
Group shall be terminated as of the Effective Time. After such date none of
the Purchased Companies, Seller and any Affiliate of Seller shall have any
further rights or liabilities thereunder.

Section 6.07. Tax Claims.

(a) If any Party receives a notice of a Tax Claim relating to the Purchased
Assets or a Purchased Company which could reasonably impact the Taxes or Tax
position of the Party not receiving such notice, the Party receiving notice of
such a Tax Claim shall notify the other party within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of notice; provided, that the failure to timely provide such notice
shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Party's indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
delay or omission.



(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for a Tax period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have control of the conduct and
defense of such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at its own expense;
provided, however, that Buyer shall be able to participate, at its own
expense, in the conduct and defense of any Tax Claim (i) in the case of an
Income Tax Claim arising in connection with an Income Tax Return of any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group that includes Seller or
the Retained Subsidiaries, to the extent such Income Tax Claim is primarily
related to any of the Purchased Companies, and Buyer's participation shall be
limited only to the portion of the Income Tax Claim that is related to a
Purchased Company, (ii) to the extent relating to Income Taxes of a Purchased
Company not arising in connection with an Income Tax Return of any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group that includes Seller or
the Retained Subsidiaries or (iii) to the extent relating to Taxes other than
Income Taxes. With respect to Tax Claims relating to Taxes for Straddle Tax
Periods, Buyer and Seller shall jointly control such Tax Claim. A Party shall
promptly notify the other Party if it decides not to control the defense or
settlement of any Tax Claim which it is entitled to control pursuant to this
Section 6.07(a) and the other Party shall thereupon be permitted to defend and
settle such Tax Claim at its own expense. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.07(a), the Party controlling any Tax Claim relating
to Income Taxes for a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for
a Straddle Period shall not settle such Tax Claim without the other Party's
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

Section 6.08. Headquarters. If Buyer locates the corporate headquarters of the
Business in the State of Florida, then for a period of five years beginning on
the date of this Agreement (the "FTE Payment Period"), Seller agrees to pay to
Buyer at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to $400 times the
number of full time equivalent employees employed by Buyer at the corporate
headquarters of the Business in the State of Florida (each, a "Business FTE")
during such calendar year. At the option of Buyer, the FTE Payment Period may
be shortened from five years to three years. During the FTE Payment Period,
Buyer shall not pursue any corporate headquarters employment-based incentives
in the State of Florida without the written consent of Seller (which consent
shall only be withheld to the extent that Seller in its good faith
determination expects to be adversely affected by such pursuit). The number of
Business FTEs shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation
under Seller's Capital Investment Tax Credit agreement with the State of
Florida, as jointly determined by Seller and Buyer. For the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2028, Buyer shall provide to
Seller, within thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal month, a list of
all full-time and part-time employees employed by Buyer at the corporate
headquarters of the Business in the State of Florida during such fiscal month
and such list shall include the following information with respect to each
employee: (i) employee identification number, (ii) date employed by Buyer,
(iii) date terminated by Buyer (if applicable), (iv) hours worked during the
fiscal month by non-exempt employees and (v) wages earned during the fiscal
month (including overtime and bonuses). For the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2028, Buyer shall provide to Seller,
within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar year, an annual report
summarizing the above information, confirming that the data presented is
accurate and listing the reemployment assistance number under which the
Business FTE's are reported by Buyer to the State of Florida.



Section 6.09. Post-Closing Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Seller shall not be liable for (a) any Taxes attributable
to the Post-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent attributable to (i) a
breach of a representation contained in Sections 3.20(h), 3.20(j) or 3.20(n),
(ii) any Liability of Seller pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(iii)(C) or (iii) a
breach of any other covenant contained in this Agreement), (b) any Taxes
attributable to or resulting from any action of Buyer after the Effective Time
on the Closing Date or (c) any Taxes resulting from the Sale Leaseback
Transaction that would not have been imposed on Seller, any Retained
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the foregoing had the Sale Leaseback
Transaction not occurred and instead had the Purchased Assets that would
otherwise have been sold to the Sale Leaseback Purchaser in the Sale Leaseback
Transaction been sold directly to Buyer or one of Buyer's Affiliates;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.09 shall
limit the Buyer Indemnitees' ability to be indemnified for any Excluded
Liabilities (including with respect to Taxes) pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(vii).

Section 6.10. Overlap Provisions. In the event of any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this Article VI and Article IX, the provisions of
this Article VI shall control.

ARTICLE VII 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.01. Employees.

(e) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make an offer of
employment (an "Offer") to each Business Employee, effective as of the Closing
Date and subject to such Business Employee remaining actively employed through
the Closing Date. Such Offers shall be for a reasonably comparable position as
compared to the position held immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall
be on the terms set forth in this Section 7.01 and Section 7.02. For this
purpose, a Business Employee will be considered "actively employed" if,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, such employee is either actively at
work or absent from work on account of paid time-off, vacation, sick leave or
similar temporary absence, but will not be "actively employed" if such
individual is not actively at work due to any other reason. For restaurant-
based Business Employees, such Offers may be provided in the form of a
"welcome letter" or similar communication. For all other Business Employees,
such Offers shall be provided in writing no less than seven (7) days prior to
the Closing Date in the form of an individual confirmation of employment
transfer notice prepared by Buyer. Buyer will provide Seller with a draft
sample confirmation of employment transfer notice a reasonable period of time
prior to such notice being provided and will reasonably consider any comments
provided by Seller. Unless a written acceptance of an offer of employment is
required by Law, any Business Employee who (i) has received such an Offer in
the applicable form described above, (ii) remains actively employed through
the Closing Date, (iii) has not specifically declined such offer, and (iv)
actually commences employment with the Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary on
the Closing Date (or his or her first regularly-scheduled day of employment
following the Closing Date or in the event of an un-scheduled absence from
work, reasonably promptly thereafter) shall be deemed (A) to have accepted
such offer and (B) to have terminated employment with the Seller on the
Closing Date. Until the Closing Date, Buyer shall keep the Seller informed of
any rejections of such Offers in a timely manner.



(f) With respect to any Business Employee who is not actively employed as of
the Closing Date (each an "Inactive Employee") but presents himself or herself
for commencement of active employment within six (6) months of Closing or such
later date with respect to which such Business Employee has a legal right for
reemployment, reinstatement or reactivation, Buyer shall offer employment to
each such Inactive Employee effective on the first date such Inactive Employee
returns to work. Buyer acknowledges that that the terms of reemployment,
reinstatement or reactivation of an Inactive Employee who is on approved leave
under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended, or any
similar Law relating to reemployment, reinstatement or reactivation rights for
employees on leave of absence immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be
governed by such Laws.

(g) Business Employees who accept (or are deemed to have accepted, as
applicable) an Offer and who commence employment with Buyer (or a Subsidiary
of Buyer) are collectively referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees";
provided that Inactive Employees shall not be considered a Transferred
Employee until such Inactive Employee actually commences active employment
with Buyer (or a Subsidiary of Buyer). Transferred Employees who are based
primarily inside the United States shall collectively be the "U.S. Transferred
Employees."

(h) Buyer shall provide any notices to the Transferred Employees that may be
required under any applicable Law, including the WARN Act or any similar Law,
with respect to events that occur after the Closing and Buyer shall not take
any action within the first ninety (90) days after the Closing that would
cause any termination of employment of any employees by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that occurs on or before the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" under the WARN Act or any similar Law, without Buyer
satisfying all resultant Liabilities that arise under the WARN Act or any
similar Law; provided that after the Closing, promptly following a reasonable
request therefor, Seller shall provide Buyer with such information as is
reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to satisfy its obligations under this
Section 7.1(d).

Section 7.02. Compensation and Benefits.

(i) Buyer agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date (the "Relevant Period"), it shall provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide) each Transferred Employee with (i) an annual base salary or wage rate
that is the same as or greater than his or her annual base salary or wage rate
in effect immediately prior to the Closing (as adjusted to reflect salary
increases to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as set forth on Schedule 5.01(n)(iv)), and (ii) incentive
compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
as compared to his or her ordinary course target short and long term incentive
compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior to the Closing, it
being understood that such incentive compensation need not be provided by
Buyer to the Transferred Employees in the form of equity or equity-based
awards and that Buyer will have discretion to determine the relevant
performance goals. Following the date of this Agreement, if requested by
Buyer, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to determine with respect
to each Transferred Employee the amount of value required to be provided by
Buyer pursuant to the foregoing commitment. In addition, Buyer agrees that (i)
if not implemented prior to the Closing, it shall



provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) to the Transferred Employees
annual performance-based salary or wage increases based on fiscal year 2014
performance (such increases expected to take effect in August 2014) in amounts
consistent with past practice in all material respects and consistent with
estimates of such increases provided to Buyer prior to the date hereof and set
forth on Schedule 5.01(n)(iii), and (ii) during the Relevant Period, it shall
provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) to each Transferred Employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those
provided to such employee under the Employee Plans set forth on Schedule
3.17(a) immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding stock
purchase, defined benefit pension, post-employment welfare arrangements or the
RARE Hospitality International, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan).

(j) The Seller shall take all actions reasonably necessary to establish on or
prior to the Closing Date a plan intended to comply with Sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the Code (the "RL Savings Plan"). The RL Savings Plan shall be the
result of an amendment to and spin-off from the Darden Savings Plan of non-
ESOP and non-employer stock account balances of Business Employees, and the
participants in the RL Savings Plan shall consist solely of Business
Employees. Seller will retain all accounts under the Darden Savings Plan that
hold common stock of Darden Restaurants, Inc. and will not offer common stock
of Darden Restaurants, Inc. as an investment option under the RL Savings Plan.
Seller and Buyer shall take all actions necessary to have Buyer assume
sponsorship of the RL Savings Plan, effective as of the Closing Date,
including assuming all assets (held in trust), liabilities and obligations
under, in connection with or relating to the RL Savings Plan, subject to
rights to indemnification under this Agreement; provided that Seller will
retain all liabilities with respect to any breaches of fiduciary duty that
have occurred prior to the Closing with respect to the RL Savings Plan or its
predecessor plan, the Darden Savings Plan. Buyer shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of any annual reports relating to plan years that
include the Closing Date; provided, however, that, with respect to pre-Closing
periods, Seller shall furnish Buyer with such information concerning the RL
Savings Plan as is reasonably necessary to prepare such reports and applicable
nondiscrimination testing. Seller shall continue to manage the RL Savings Plan
in a manner that is consistent with past practice, including with respect to
investment of assets, subject to fiduciary obligations, until the Closing
Date. Seller shall make contributions for its fiscal year ending in 2014 to
the Darden Restaurants, Inc. Flexcomp Plan (the "Flexcomp Plan") on behalf of
Business Employees at the same time Seller makes contributions for its fiscal
year ending in 2014 on behalf of its other employees and the determination of
Closing Date Net Working Capital shall take into account a reasonable accrual
for contributions for Seller's fiscal year ending in 2015 to the Flexcomp Plan
on behalf of Business Employees with respect to all periods of participation
during Seller's fiscal year ending in 2015 through the Closing Date, in each
case determining such contribution amounts on a good faith basis, disregarding
any eligibility requirements for receiving such contributions that would
otherwise require the Business Employees to remain employed by Seller or its
Affiliates through the last day of any respective contribution period. Without
limiting its obligations under Section 7.02(a), Buyer shall give such Business
Employees credit for such amounts taken into account in determining Closing
Date Net Working Capital under a non-qualified retirement plan that Buyer
adopts for the benefit of such Business Employees or shall payout such amounts
to such Business Employees following the Closing. The determination of Closing
Date Net Working Capital shall take into account a reasonable accrual for
matching and retirement plus contributions to be made on behalf of Business
Employees under the



RL Savings Plan (as successor to the Darden Savings Plan with respect to such
Business Employees) on a pro-rata basis with respect to all periods of
participation through the Closing Date, determining such matching and
retirement plus contribution amounts in good faith on a basis that is
consistent with the employer contributions historically made by Seller or its
Affiliates under Darden Savings Plan for its other similarly situated
employees, disregarding any eligibility requirements for receiving such
contributions that would otherwise require the Transferred Employees to remain
employed by Seller or its Affiliates through the last day of the respective
contribution period and, without limiting its obligations under Section
7.02(a), Buyer will contribute such matching and retirement plus contributions
to the RL Savings Plan following the Closing Date, in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice in accordance with the terms of such
plan.

(k) Buyer shall grant (or cause its Subsidiaries to grant) each Transferred
Employee credit for years of prior service with Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective predecessors for eligibility and vesting
purposes under each employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA) sponsored or maintained by Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries, and for the purposes of determining future accrued
vacation or paid time off or severance amounts, to the same extent such
service was recognized for similar purposes under the Employee Plans prior to
the Closing; provided, however, that such credit shall not result in a
duplication of benefits. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and exchange such
information as is necessary to avoid any such duplication of benefits.

(l) As of 12:01 am U.S. eastern time on the Closing Date, or, with respect to
any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, the time of
commencement of employment with Buyer or its Subsidiaries (the "Transfer
Time"), each Transferred Employee participating in any Employee Plan that is a
health and welfare benefit plan (each, a "Seller Welfare Plan") shall cease to
be eligible to participate in such Seller Welfare Plans and Buyer shall permit
such Transferred Employee to commence participation in health and welfare
benefit plans that shall be maintained, administered or contributed to, as
applicable, as of the Transfer Time by Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Seller
shall be responsible for claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan (in
accordance with such plan) for Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries
and dependents prior to the Transfer Time. All health and welfare benefit
claims incurred for Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and
dependents under the welfare plans sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates (the
"Buyer Welfare Plans") at or after the Transfer Time shall be the
responsibility of Buyer and its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section
7.02(c), claims shall be deemed to be incurred in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Seller Welfare Plans. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall provide such reasonable assistance as Buyer may request to facilitate
and support the establishment of the Buyer Welfare Plans, including, as
requested, using commercially reasonable efforts to provide access to and to
negotiate with the current vendors or suppliers of or to the Seller Welfare
Plans and to support the preparation, as necessary, of plan documents and
related materials for the Seller Welfare Plans are substantially similar to
the existing Seller Welfare Plans. As of the Transfer Time, Buyer shall assume
sole responsibility for compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code and part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations
thereunder ("COBRA") with respect to the Transferred Employees and any of
their dependents and beneficiaries, including with respect to the Transferred
Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries who are "MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries" within the meaning of COBRA and incur a



"qualifying event" within the meaning of COBRA in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(m) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any health
and welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing to the extent that such limitations were waived
or satisfied or did not apply under the applicable Seller Welfare Plan; and
(ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Transfer Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any health benefit plans in
which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing
Date.

(n) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) have in effect Buyer
Welfare Plans that are medical and dependent care flexible spending account
plans (the "Buyer FSA Plans") that will provide benefits to Transferred
Employees who participate in Seller's medical and dependent care flexible
spending account plans as of immediately prior to the Transfer Time (the
"Seller FSA Plans"). For the remainder of the plan year in which the Transfer
Time occurs, each U.S. Transferred Employee shall continue to have payroll
deductions made as most recently elected by him or her under the applicable
Seller FSA Plan. On and after the Transfer Time, Buyer shall assume and be
solely responsible for all eligible claims for reimbursement by Transferred
Employees for claims incurred in 2014, whether incurred prior to, on or after
the Transfer Time, that have not been paid in full as of the Transfer Time,
which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the Buyer FSA
Plans. The determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital shall include a
net asset or Liability for the net aggregate account balances of the
Transferred Employees under the Seller FSA Plans, determined as of the Closing
Date. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Seller will
provide Buyer with such information, including the FSA account balance so
transferred, FSA claims previously paid in 2014 and payroll deduction
elections, as may be reasonably necessary for Buyer to comply with this
Section 7.02(f). This Section 7.02(e) shall be interpreted and administered in
a manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

(o) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) provide severance
benefits to any Transferred Employee who is laid off or whose employment is
otherwise involuntarily terminated by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries without
cause during the Severance Protection Period in an amount that is equal to the
greater of the severance benefits (including severance payments and continued
health coverage) as set forth on Schedule 7.2(g)(i) or (ii) solely with
respect to the employees set forth on Schedule 7.2(g)(ii) (if they become
Transferred Employees), unless such employees consent to receive severance
provided under employment agreements that supersede the payment of severance
pursuant to this paragraph and Seller is a beneficiary of releases under such
employment agreements that are reasonably satisfactory to Seller (with
Seller's approval not to be unreasonably withheld), provide severance benefits
equal to or greater than the severance payments set forth on Schedule
7.2(g)(ii) upon an termination without "Cause" or resignation for "Good
Reason" as defined on Schedule 7.02(g)(ii) (provided that such definitions of
Cause and Good Reason shall not apply to or be triggered by any changes
effected in connection with Buyer's hiring or employment of such Transferred
Employees in connection with the transactions contemplated



by this Agreement (including that such Persons will no longer have duties and
responsibilities with respect to multiple business segments or divisions);
provided, further, that in no event shall Buyer or its Subsidiaries be
obligated to provide any severance benefits in violation of applicable Law.
For purposes of the foregoing, Severance Protection Period means (i) with
respect to the employees set forth on Schedule 7.02(g)(ii), 24 months
following the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to all other Transferred
Employees, the Relevant Period.

(p) Subject to Seller's indemnification obligations under Section 9.02(a)(v),
Buyer shall be responsible for all claims for workers' compensation benefits
that are incurred prior to the Transfer Time by any any current or former
employee of the Business, including any Business Employee ("Pre-Closing
Workers Compensation Claims"). In addition, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all claims for workers' compensation benefits that are
incurred on or after the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee ("Post-
Closing Workers Compensation Claims"). A claim for workers' compensation
benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the injury, illness or event
giving rise to the claim (a "Workers Compensation Event") occurs. If the
Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following
the Transfer Time, a portion of the claim shall be considered a Pre-Closing
Workers Compensation Claim and a portion of the claim shall be considered a
Post-Closing Workers Compensation Claim, in each case based upon the relative
periods of time that the Workers Compensation Event transpired preceding and
following the Transfer Time.

Section 7.03. Vacation and Other Paid Time Off. Buyer (or its Subsidiary)
shall assume any accrued but unused vacation or other paid-time off ("PTO") as
of the Transfer Time for each Transferred Employee, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to (i) hourly Transferred Employees in
the jurisdictions identified on Schedule 7.03 and (ii) salaried Transferred
Employees in the jurisdictions identified on Schedule 7.03 who do not consent
to the transfer of PTO to the Buyer (or its Subsidiaries) and determination of
Closing Date Net Working Capital shall take such PTO that is assumed by Buyer
(or its Subsidiary) into account. For such Transferred Employees in the
jurisdictions identified in Schedule 7.03, Seller shall be responsible for all
PTO that is accrued as of the Transfer Time and shall pay such Transferred
Employees their PTO account balances as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing.

Section 7.04. Accrued Compensation. Except as provided in Section 7.03, or as
otherwise provided under applicable Law, Seller shall retain all Liabilities
to pay all Transferred Employees all wages, salaries, commissions and similar
compensation earned or accrued through the Transfer Time and all incentive or
bonus obligations with respect to applicable performance periods that have
ended prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall have no Liability for any
unpaid wages, salaries, commissions or similar compensation earned prior to
the Transfer Time for Transferred Employees and all incentive or bonus
obligations with respect to applicable performance periods that have ended
prior to the Closing Date, and Seller shall pay such Transferred Employees all
such earned or accrued compensation as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing. Except with respect to any amounts payable for an
applicable performance period that has ended prior to the Closing Date, as of
the Closing Date, Buyer will assume all obligations to each Business Employee
pursuant to any annual or other short-term cash incentive or bonus Employee
Plan set forth on Schedule 7.04 covering such Business Employee as of the
Closing Date. Consistent with



the Buyer's obligations under this Section 7.04, the Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, pay the Transferred Employees incentive
compensation on the same basis as in effect prior to the Closing Date for the
applicable performance measurement period which includes the Closing Date. As
of the Closing, Buyer will assume, with respect to each Transferred Employee,
all obligations with respect to tuition reimbursement or similar benefits for
all in-process or completed courses not yet reimbursed by Seller and will pay
such benefits to the applicable Transferred Employee in a manner consistent
with the terms of the corresponding Employee Plan. The determination of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital shall take into account reasonable accruals
for such incentive, bonus and tuition reimbursement amounts.

Section 7.05. Employee Communications. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate in communications with Business Employees with respect to employee
benefit plans maintained by Seller or Buyer and with respect to other matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, until the Closing Date, Buyer shall consult
with Seller and obtain Seller's consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before distributing any
communications to any Business Employee, whether relating to employee
benefits, terms of employment or otherwise and shall provide Seller with
advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on (and shall
consider in good faith all such comments), all material communications to any
Business Employee relating to post-Closing employment, employee benefits,
terms of employment and similar matters.

Section 7.06. Acknowledgement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that
nothing contained in this Article VII shall be construed to limit in any way
the ability of Buyer or its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employee from and after the Transfer Time[; provided that such
termination is in accordance with Law and subject to Section 7.02(f)].

Section 7.07. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
Section 11.08, nothing in this Article VII, express or implied, is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement upon any Person (including any Transferred Employees) other than the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns to
continued employment or any severance or other benefits from Seller, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Article VII
shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or employee benefit
plan or a limitation on the rights of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate, either before or
after Closing, any employee benefit plan, or is intended to confer upon any
current or former employee any right to employment or continued employment for
any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment.

Section 7.08. Section 409A

Section 7.09. Payroll. For U.S. Transferred Employees, pursuant to IRS Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, Buyer and Seller shall apply the "standard" method for
purposes of employee payroll reporting.

Section 7.10. Cooperation. Each of Buyer and Seller recognize it to be in the
best interests of the Parties hereto and their respective employees that the
transactions in this Article VII be



effected in an orderly manner and agree to devote their reasonable best
efforts and to cooperate fully in complying with the provisions of this
Article VII. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Parties agree to execute, deliver and file all documents and to take all such
actions as are deemed necessary or desirable in order to carry out and perform
the purpose of this Article VII and to facilitate the transactions referred to
in this Article VII.

Section 9.01. Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties and
all covenants and agreements which by their terms are to be performed at or
prior to the Closing contained in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered by any of the Parties at Closing shall survive the Closing for a
period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date; provided that: (x) the

this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed or fulfilled, unless
and to the extent only that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements
is waived in writing by the Party entitled to such performance.
Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any breach or inaccuracy of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if written notice
in accordance with Section 9.03 of the breach or inaccuracy thereof giving
rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the Party against
whom such indemnity may be sought prior to



such time. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim
that any Party may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in
this Section 9.01 shall govern when any such claim may be brought and, except
in the case of clause (x) of the first sentence of this Section 9.01, shall
replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be
applicable.

Section 9.02. Indemnification.

(f) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, effective at and after the
Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Purchased Companies), directors, officers, employees,
successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnitees") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any
and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of or
relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in Article III or
Schedule 3.24 of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than
the Transition Services Agreement, the Intellectual Property License
Agreement, the Gift Card Agreement and the Software License Agreement) or any
such representation or warranty being untrue or inaccurate as of the Closing
Date (as if remade in haec verba on the Closing Date, except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date);

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the
Transition Services Agreement, the Intellectual Property License Agreement,
the Gift Card Agreement and the Software License Agreement);

(i) except to the extent taken into account in the final determination of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, (A) any and all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets or the Business for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (B) any and all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which any Purchased
Company (or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing
Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
corresponding or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation), and (C)
any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Purchased Assets or the
Purchased Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to
any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing Date;

(ii) (a) Liabilities with respect to the Actions set forth on Schedule 3.10
under the heading "Employment-Related Actions" (other than the Bluet Matter)
to the extent such Liabilities exceed $500,000 in the aggregate;

(iii) Liabilities with respect to (a) all public liability claims that are
incurred by the Seller prior to Closing (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
includes all claims set forth on Schedule 3.10 under the heading "Litigation -
Insured") and (b) all Pre-Closing



Workers Compensation Claims to the extent that the aggregate amount of such
Liabilities described in this clause (v) exceed the Claims Amount;

(iv) Liabilities arising from (a) any third party claim by any landlord party
to any Lease or the counterparty to any Assumed Contract to the extent such
Lease or Assumed Contract is breached by Seller as a result of the assignment
of such Lease or Assumed Contract in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the consent of such landlord or
counterparty in accordance with the terms hereof or (b) any sanction or
penalty by any Governmental Authority as a result of any transfer of any
Assigned Liquor License or any Assigned Permits in accordance with the terms
hereof without the approval of such Governmental Authority; or

(v) without duplication, any Excluded Liability;

provided that (A) with respect to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(i), Seller shall not be liable for any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller (1) attributable to a single course of
conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of
Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach exceeds
$50,000 (the "Seller Mini-Basket") and (2) unless the aggregate amount of
Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for all such breaches exceeds
$7,500,000 (the "Seller Deductible"), and then only to the extent such
aggregate Damages exceed such amount; and (B) in no event shall Seller's
aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.02(a)(i) exceed
$60,000,000 (the "Seller Cap"), provided, further, that neither the Seller
Mini-Basket, the Seller Deductible nor the Seller Cap shall apply to any
single item, or group of related items, that results in Damages incurred by
the Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or relating to the breach of any
Fundamental Representation or the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.14(a) and Section 3.20, which, in each case, the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to recover in their entirety; provided, further, that
neither the Seller Mini-Basket nor the Seller Deductible shall apply to any
single item, or group of related items, that results in Damages incurred by
the Buyer Indemnitees arising out of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.14(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that any
Damages constitute, or otherwise arise out of or relate to an Assumed
Liability shall not limit the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee to
indemnification under this Section 9.02(a).

(g) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, effective at and after the
Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") against and agrees to hold each of
them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnitee arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document (other than the Transition Services Agreement,
the Intellectual Property License Agreement, the Gift Card Agreement and the
Software License Agreement);

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the



Transition Services Agreement, the Intellectual Property License Agreement,
the Gift Card Agreement and the Software License Agreement); or

(iii) without duplication, any Assumed Liability or any Liability of a
Purchased Company;

provided that (A) with respect to indemnification by Buyer pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(i), Buyer shall not be liable for any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer (1) attributable to a single course of conduct or related
set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of Damages actually
incurred by the Seller Indemnitees for such breach exceeds $50,000 and (2)
unless the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnitees for
all such breaches exceeds $7,500,000 (the "Buyer Deductible"), and then only
to the extent such aggregate Damages exceed such amount; and (B) in no event
shall Buyer's aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to Section
9.02(a)(i) exceed $60,000,000 (the "Buyer Cap"), provided, further, that
neither the Buyer Deductible nor the Buyer Cap shall apply to any single item,
or group of related items, that results in Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnitees arising out of or relating to the breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 (Corporate Existence
and Power), Section 4.02 (Corporate Authorization) and Section 4.09 (Finders'
Fees), which, in each case, the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to
recover in their entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that any
Damages constitute, or otherwise arise out of or relate to an Excluded
Liability shall not limit the rights of any Seller Indemnitee to
indemnification under this Section 9.02(a).

(h) For purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and for
computing the dollar amount of any claim for indemnification resulting from a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, all
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, material adverse effect and similar
qualifications shall be disregarded.

Section 9.03. Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(c) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming indemnification under
this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification hereunder shall
promptly notify in writing (such notice, a "Claim Notice") the other Party
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim, which Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of
the Third Party Claim, including the basis of the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement and the amount of the Damages arising
or estimated to arise therefrom (if available); provided that subject to
Section 9.01, failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the
right of the Indemnified Party's indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay or
omission.

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim at any time and, subject to the limitations
contained in this Section 9.03(b), assume and control the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party



that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control the defense of the
Third Party Claim at any time and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing that such Third Party Claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this
Article IX), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party in all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 9.03(b). The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or control such defense
and proceedings if such Third Party Claim seeks equitable or other non-
monetary relief (including any sanction or restriction upon the conduct or
operation of any business of the Indemnified Party) or if the Third Party
Claim alleges conduct that would constitute criminal activity or if the
resolution of such Third Party Claim in a manner adverse to the Indemnified
Party could result in Damages to the Indemnified Party in excess of the amount
claimed or expected to be received from the Indemnifying Party (other than as
a result of the Buyer Deductible or the Seller Deductible or any per claim
basket), and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement
agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third
party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and
(ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any admission by, or sanction
or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any business by, the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, including any injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates). The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 9.03(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to such participation unless (i) the
employment of separate legal counsel has been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) there exists a material conflict of
interest, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to pursue the defense of such
Third Party Claim actively and diligently, in the cause of clause (ii) or
(iii), whereupon the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain the defense
of such Third Party Claim.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.03(b) within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of any Claim
Notice or is not otherwise entitled to defend such Third Party Claim, then
subject to Section 9.03(b) the Indemnified Party shall defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified
Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 9.03(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.



(f) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including providing
access to documents, records and information. In addition, the Indemnified
Party will make its personnel available at no cost to the Indemnifying Party
for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party also agrees
to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and executing powers of
attorney to the extent necessary unless doing so would materially impair the
conduct of the business conducted by the Indemnified Party.

(g) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying Party, which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the basis of the
Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement and the
amount of the Damages estimated to arise therefrom (to the extent reasonably
estimable). Subject to Section 9.01, failure to timely provide such notice
shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Party's indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(h) With respect to any claim that any Buyer Indemnitee may assert for
indemnification with respect to any Damages incurred for any environmental
investigation, monitoring, remediation, or other response or removal action
("Environmental Response") relating to the Business Real Property, Seller
shall have no indemnification obligations under this Agreement for any
Environmental Response to the extent such Damages result from any intrusive
subsurface investigation by any Buyer Indemnitee, except for such
investigation that is (i) required by Environmental Laws, a Permit or a
Governmental Authority, (ii) conducted to investigate conditions that suggest
an imminent and significant threat to human health or the environment, (iii)
conducted for the purposes of bona fide construction or expansion of a
building or other facility improvement or repair, or (iv) expressly or
affirmatively required at any Leased Real Property pursuant to any Lease or by
any prospective buyer in connection with the bona fide sale of such Leased
Real Property.

Section 9.04. Calculation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein:

(c) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent a
liability or reserve relating to the matter giving rise to such Damages has
been included in the final determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness or Closing Date Cash pursuant to Section 2.09(c);

(d) each Indemnified Party shall take reasonably prudent steps consistent with
customary business practices to mitigate any Damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby after
becoming actually aware of the incurrence of such Damages;



(e) the amount of any Damage for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement: (i) shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually received from third party insurers with respect to such
Damage; (ii) shall be reduced by any net Tax Benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Damage in the taxable year of such
Damage, in any prior taxable year or in the next two taxable years following
such Damage, as calculated on a with and without basis; and (iii) shall be
reduced by indemnification or reimbursement payments actually received from
third parties with respect to such Damage, net, in the case of each of clauses
(i) and (iii) above, of any reasonable costs associated with the recovery of
such amounts. In the event any Indemnified Party actually recovers any
insurance proceeds, such Tax benefits, indemnity payments or any third-party
recoveries in respect of any Damages, in each case at any time subsequent to
any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX, such Indemnified
Party shall thereafter promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
indemnity payment made up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified
Party (net of any costs, fees or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount);

(f) in the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Damages in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this Article IX, no other Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover the same Damages in respect of such claim for
indemnification such that there will be no "double recovery" of Damages in
respect of the same claim;

(g) except with respect to those actually awarded and paid on account of a
Third Party Claim, no Party shall be liable for (i) punitive or exemplary
damages or (ii) incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, lost
profits or lost business, loss of enterprise value, diminution in value of any
business, damage to reputation or loss to goodwill, whether based on contract,
tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise and whether or not arising from
any other Party's sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or
other fault except, in the case of clause (ii), to the extent such Damages are
reasonably foreseeable in connection with the event that gave rise thereto or
the matter for which indemnification is sought hereunder;

(h) the amount of any Damage for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall not include the costs of compliance
with any equitable remedies resulting from any Action subject to the
indemnification hereunder, including the costs of compliance with any
prospective injunctive relief or the associated need to change the relevant
business practices on a going-forward basis except to the extent such remedies
have been consented to by the Indemnified Party in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed;

(i) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX, to sue for, or to assert any other right or remedy with respect
to, any Damages, causes of action or other claims to the extent they are
possible or potential Damages, causes of action or claims that such party
believes may be asserted rather than Damages, causes of action or claims that
have, in fact, been filed of record against such Indemnified Party or paid or
incurred by such Indemnified Party; and



(j) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto and the Indemnified Parties hereby waive
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law the remedy of rescission.

Section 9.05. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.02 and the Indemnified Party would have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any pertinent Contract, assign
such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to assign any right to proceed against a Potential
Contributor if the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable discretion
that such assignment would be materially detrimental to its business,
reputation or future business prospects.

Section 9.06. Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payment made pursuant
to the indemnification obligations arising under Article IX of this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent
allowable under applicable Law, including for Tax purposes.

Section 9.07. Exclusivity

Section 9.08. Additional Agreements. In consideration of Buyer's execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and in addition to all of Seller's other
obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer, the Sale Leaseback Purchaser and each other Buyer Indemnitee from and
against any and all Damages (collectively, the "Transaction Liabilities")
incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to any
matters set forth on Schedule 9.08. To the extent that the foregoing
undertaking by Seller may be or be deemed unenforceable for any reason, Seller
shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of all
Transaction Liabilities which is permissible under applicable Law.

ARTICLE X 
TERMINATION

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(i) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(j) by either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any other
Action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that this right of
termination shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, such order, decree, ruling, injunction or other Action;



(k) by Buyer, if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in Article III hereof or any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that would cause
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.02 to be satisfied on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided that, in each case under this clause (c),
Buyer may not terminate this Agreement unless Buyer has given written notice
of such breach to Seller and, with respect to any breach that is capable of
being cured, Seller has not cured such breach within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice; provided, that Buyer is not in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

(l) by Seller, if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Article IV hereof or any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that would cause
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.03 to be satisfied on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided that, in each case under this clause (d),
Seller may not terminate this Agreement unless Seller has given written notice
of such breach to Buyer and, with respect to any breach that is capable of
being cured, Buyer has not cured such breach within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice; provided, that Seller is not in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

(m) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred within one
hundred eighty (180) days (the last day of such one hundred eighty (180) day
period, the "Outside Date") after the date hereof; provided that, this right
of termination shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement has primarily been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur before such date; or

(n) by Seller, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and
Section 8.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied, other than those conditions that have not been satisfied as a
result of Buyer's breach of this Agreement) have been satisfied or waived,
(ii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Buyer that (A) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.03 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been
satisfied or have been waived by Seller and (B) Seller is ready, willing and
able to consummate the Closing on such date and through the twenty (20)
Business Day period following the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.08 (provided that such confirmation shall not
be delivered earlier than the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant
to Section 2.08), and (iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within
twenty (20) Business Days of the date the aforementioned confirmation has been
delivered to Buyer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, during such
twenty (20) Business Day period following the date on which the aforementioned
confirmation has been delivered to Buyer, no Party shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(e).

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.

(i) In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,
without any Liability on the part of any Party hereto; provided, however, that
such termination shall not relieve any Party



of Liability for any Damages incurred or suffered by a Party as a result of
the intentional and willful breach of another Party of any obligations
required to be performed by it prior to such termination. The provisions of
Section 9.08, this Section 10.02 and Article XI (other than Section 11.12
thereof) hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

(j) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to
Section 10.01(d) or Section 10.01(f) then, in either case, Buyer shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Seller or its designees an amount
equal to $60,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be required
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(k) Except for Seller's right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section
11.12, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided
therein, Seller's receipt of the Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.02(b) (or from Guarantor pursuant to the Limited Guaranty) and the
payment of any other amounts due pursuant to Section 5.02 (with respect to the
confidentiality agreement), the last sentence of Section 5.03(b), Section
5.22(d) and Section 10.02(e) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort, for strict liability, or
otherwise, including any Action, against (i) Buyer and the former, current and
future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees of Buyer, and any future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, assignees of any of the
foregoing (the Persons described in this Section 10.02(c)(i), collectively,
the "Buyer Group") for any Damages suffered as a result of (A) any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made or alleged to have
been made in connection herewith or in any of the other Transaction Documents,
the Commitment Letters, the Sale Leaseback Agreement or the other agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith, (B) any failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, the Commitment Letters,
the Sale Leaseback Agreement or the other agreements, instruments or documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (C) the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or (D) this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Sale Leaseback Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents, agreements, instruments or documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the failure of
any such transactions to be consummated or the termination of this Agreement;
and (ii) the Sale Leaseback Purchaser and any Financing Source (including
Affiliates or agents), lender or prospective lender, lead arranger, arranger,
agent or Representative of or to Buyer, including, each party to the Debt
Commitment Letter, and their respective Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (those under
this Section 10.02(c)(ii), the "Lender Group") and the Seller shall not seek
to recover any other monetary damages or seek any other claim at law or in
equity with respect thereto.



(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Sale Leaseback Purchaser nor any Financing Source or any entity or Person
within the Lender Group shall have any liability or obligation to Seller or
any of its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, and the Seller (on behalf of
itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Sale Leaseback Agreement or any
related documentation or any of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein (including the Sale Leaseback Financing, any Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing) or in respect of any other related document any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
and the Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to commence any
action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Sale Leaseback Agreement or any related documentation or any of
the transactions contemplated herein or therein (including the Sale Leaseback
Financing, any Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing) or in respect
of any other related document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such action or
proceeding asserted by the Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in
connection with this Agreement, the Sale Leaseback Agreement or any related
documentation or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein
(including the Sale Leaseback Financing, any Debt Financing or any Alternative
Debt Financing), or in respect of any other related document or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity against
any Debt Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged
and agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any
claims or damages to the Seller in connection with this Agreement, the Sale
Leaseback Agreement or any related documentation or any of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein (including the Sale Leaseback Financing, any
Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

(m) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other Transaction Document may only be brought
against Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto. No
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, members, managers,
agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of Seller, Buyer,
the Guarantor or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling Person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member,
manager, general or limited partner, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of
the foregoing shall have any Liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or Liabilities
of Seller or Buyer under this Agreement or of or for any Action based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of
any Party or other Person or otherwise.



(n) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
10.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Without limiting any other rights of the Seller hereunder, if Buyer
fails to pay the Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Seller commences an Action that results in a final, binding and non-
appealable judgment against Buyer for the Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to
Seller, together with the Termination Fee, (A) interest on the Termination Fee
from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to
the rate per annum published in The Wall Street Journal from time to time as
the prime lending rate prevailing during any relevant period and (B) Seller's
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
reasonably incurred in connection with such Action. Without limiting Seller's
right to obtain an award of specific performance permitted by Section 11.12,
solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or expanding
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed
that the Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

(k) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(l) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 9.07 or Section 10.02, the rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 10.02,
Section 11.06, Section 11.07, Section 11.08, and this Section 11.02(c) (and
any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of Section 10.02,
Section 11.04, Section 11.05, Section 11.06, Section 11.08, Section 11.07,
this Section 11.02(c) and Section 11.12) may not be modified, waived or

or the Sale Leaseback Purchaser, as applicable; provided, further, that no
provision of this Agreement with respect to which the Sale Leaseback Purchaser
is an express third party beneficiary pursuant to the last sentence of Section
11.08 may be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse to the
Sale Leaseback Purchaser without the prior written consent of the Sale
Leaseback Purchaser.

Section 11.03. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement (i) shall be paid by the
Party incurring such cost or expense, and (ii) incurred by or on behalf of
Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries shall not be incurred by any of the
Purchased Companies. At Closing, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for fifty
percent (50%) of all real estate diligence costs (including in connection with
obtaining title reports, surveys, property condition reports and Phase I
reports) incurred by Seller prior to the date hereof in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Sale Leaseback Agreement.

Section 11.04. Assignment; Successors and Assigns. No Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the written consent of the other Party hereto; provided,
that, without the consent of Seller, (i) Buyer may assign its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates or, after
the Closing, to an acquirer of all or substantially all of the Business, (ii)
Buyer may collaterally assign this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, in whole or in part, to any Financing Source as collateral
security, and (iii) Buyer may assign its right (or New Operating Company's
right) to acquire all or any portion of the Business Real Property and the
Owned Ground Lease Improvements which would otherwise be transferred to Buyer
at Closing to one or more of its Affiliates and/or the Sale Leaseback
Purchaser (in which case Seller shall transfer and convey such Owned Real
Property and/or Owned Ground Lease Improvements (or portions thereof as
specified by Buyer) to such Person(s)). In the event of an assignment pursuant
to clauses (i) - (iii) of the foregoing sentence, nothing herein shall relieve
Buyer of its obligations hereunder, including the obligation to pay the
Purchase Price; provided that, to the extent performance or payment is made by
an Affiliate or Affiliates of Buyer with respect to an obligation of Buyer
hereunder, such obligations shall be satisfied to the extent of such
performance or payment. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
(including the Financing Sources) and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state. The Parties expressly waive any
right they may have, now or in the future, to demand or seek the application
of a governing law other than the law of the State of Delaware.

Section 11.06. Jurisdiction.



(h) The Parties expressly agree that any Action seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, relating to or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if such courts shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and, in each case,
appellate courts therefrom, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware) (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any
such Action and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees (i) not to commence any
such Action except in such Court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such Action may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court, and

Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
Party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
Party hereto. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other Party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no

rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than

Section 11.09. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the matters covered hereby and thereby and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties with
respect thereto.

Section 11.10. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions



of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.11. Disclosure Schedule. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules that are
not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the convenience
of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that
the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that
the matter is material, (c) except with respect to the representations and
warranties in Section 3.04, which shall only be qualified by Schedule 3.04 in
the Disclosure Schedules, if any section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an
item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure
required by or provided in another section of the Disclosure Schedules or the
statements contained in any Section of Article III reasonably apparent, the
matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other
section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other section or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure Schedule, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the Disclosure
Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions
of this Agreement and (f) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and
statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of Seller except as
and to the extent provided in this Agreement (it being agreed that statements
set forth on Schedule 3.24 constitute representations and warranties of the
Seller).

Section 11.12. Specific Performance.

(t) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 11.12, including the limitations set forth
herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, of any of
their respective covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, be
entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the
other, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and agreements of the other under this
Agreement. The Parties hereto have specifically bargained for the right to
specific performance of the obligations hereunder, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Section 11.12, notwithstanding the potential for
payment of the Termination Fee in the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.02.



(u) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that Seller shall only be entitled to specific performance of Buyer's
obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by demanding Buyer to
enforce the obligations of the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter and
Buyer's rights thereunder, only to the extent Buyer or its Affiliates have
such right under the respective commitments of the Debt Commitment Letter or
Equity Commitment Letter, and only in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section
8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied, other than those
conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of Buyer's breach of this
Agreement), (ii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing on the date the Closing
should have occurred in breach of Section 2.08, (iii) the Debt Financing has
been funded or will be funded subject only to the Equity Financing being
funded at the Closing and the Sale Leaseback Financing being consummated, (iv)
the Sale Leaseback Financing has been funded or will be funded subject only to
the consummation of the Closing and (v) Seller has not terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Article X and has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that Seller is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing such
that the Closing will occur if specific performance is granted and the Debt
Financing, the Equity Financing and the Sale Leaseback Financing are funded.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Seller be entitled to enforce
specifically Buyer's right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as
expressly set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, including if either
the Sale Leaseback Financing or the Debt Financing has not been funded (or
will not be f funded at the Closing as described in the immediately preceding
sentence).

Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
such Party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and agreements of such Party under this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.12. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.12.
Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 11.12, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.12 are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 11.12
shall require any Party to institute any Action for (or limit any Party's
right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this Section
11.12 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article X, nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section
11.12 or anything set forth in this Section 11.12 restrict or limit any
Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article X or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty that may be available then or
thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, under
no circumstances will (i) Seller be permitted or entitled to recover both (x)
a grant of specific performance to cause the



Equity Financing to be funded and the Closing to be consummated and (y) the
payment of the Termination Fee and (ii) Seller be entitled to monetary damages
in excess of the sum of (x) the Termination Fee and (y) the amounts payable by
Buyer under Section 5.02 (with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement),
Section 5.03(b), Section 5.22(d) and Section 10.02(f).

Section 11.13. Conflicts of Interest. Each of Buyer and the Purchased
Companies hereby waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to
cause any other applicable Affiliates of the Purchased Companies to waive and
to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of
Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or any of their
respective officers, employees or directors (any such person, a "Designated
Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, by Latham and Watkins LLP, GrayRobinson, P.A.,
and Akerman, LLP (collectively, "Prior Business Counsel"). Without limiting
the foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree that, following the Closing, Prior
Business Counsel may serve as counsel to any Designated Person in connection
with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding any representation by Prior Business Counsel prior to the
Closing, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, as of
the Closing Date, the Purchased Companies)) hereby agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Companies), on the one hand,
and any Designated Person, on the other hand, Prior Business Counsel may
represent one or more Designated Persons in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Companies) and even though Prior
Business Counsel may have represented such Purchased Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

Section 11.14. Seal. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any
representations or warranties that contemplate an indefinite survival period
shall be subject to the twenty (20) year statute of limitations applicable to
sealed instruments under Delaware law
