_Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_, to submit an election (each, an "
_Election_ ") in accordance with the following procedures:

(i) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail a form of election, which
form shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election
Form_ "), with the Company Proxy Statement to the record holders of Company
Common Shares as of the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting (the
" _Election Form Record Date_ ") and each Award Holder, which Election Form
shall be used by each record holder of Company Common Shares and each Award
Holder who wishes to make an Election.

 

(ii) Each holder of a Company Common Share and each Award Holder may specify
in an Election Form submitted in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.2(c)_ whether such holder elects to receive with respect to such
holders Company Common Shares or Awards, (A) the Standard Election
Consideration (such Election with respect to such Company Common Shares or
Awards, the " _Standard Election_ "), (B) the Cash Election Consideration
(such Election with respect to such Company Common Shares or Awards, the "
_Cash Election_ "), or (C) the Share Election Consideration (such Election
with respect to such Company Common Shares or Awards, the " _Share Election_
").

 

(iii) Any holder of a Company Common Share or any Award Holder who does not
properly make an Election in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.2(c)_, or whose Election Form is not received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline in the manner provided in _Section 2.2(c)(iv)_, will be
deemed to have made the Standard Election with respect to such Company Common
Shares or Awards. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of determining
the allocation of the Transaction Consideration among the holders of Company
Common Shares and Award Holders (as applicable), any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have made a Standard Election with respect to such
Dissenting Shares.

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 5 |  | 
   |  |  |  | (iv) Any such holders Election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by the
Election Deadline, an Election Form properly completed and signed and, to the
extent such Election Form relates to Company Common Shares, accompanied by
Certificates (unless such Company Common Shares are Book-Entry Shares, in
which case the holders shall follow the instructions set forth in the Election
Form) of Company Common Shares to which such Election Form relates (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such Certificates or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates as set forth in such Election Form; _provided_ that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within five (5)
Business Days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery).

(v) _Ability to Revoke Election Forms_. Any holder may, at any time prior to
the Election Deadline, change or revoke such holders Election by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form or, to
the extent such Election Form relates to Company Common Shares, by withdrawal
prior to the Election Deadline of such holders Certificates, or of the
guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, or any documents in respect of
Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an
Election is validly made with respect to any Company Common Shares, any
subsequent transfer of such Company Common Shares shall automatically revoke
such Election and, if the subsequent transfer of such Company Common Shares
occurs after the Election Deadline, the Standard Election shall be deemed to
have been made with respect to such Company Common Shares pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)(ii)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon a valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_. Subject to the terms of the
Exchange Agent Agreement and this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with
respect to any Company Common Share or Award (neither Parent nor the Company
nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any shareholder or
award holder of any such defect); in the event the Exchange Agent makes such a
determination, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the
Company Common Shares or Awards covered by such Election shall, for purposes
hereof, be deemed to be a Standard Election, unless a proper Election is
thereafter timely made with respect to such Company Common Shares or Awards.

 

(vi) _Determination of Exchange Agent Binding_. Within three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation of the Transaction Consideration among the holders of Company
Common Shares, other than Excluded Shares, and Award Holders (subject to
_Section 2.4(e)_), as set forth in  _Section 2.1(c)_. Subject to the
provisions of the Exchange Agent Agreement, the determination of the Exchange
Agent shall be binding as to whether an Election shall have been properly made
or revoked pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(c)_ with respect to Company Common
Shares or Awards and when Elections and revocations were received by it.
Subject to the provision of the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent
also shall make all computations as to the allocation and the proration
contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_, and any such computation shall be
conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Common Shares or Awards.

   |  |  |  | (d) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration, other than those holders who have properly
completed and submitted, and have not revoked Election Forms pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, the following: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), specifying that delivery shall be
effected upon (x) proper delivery of certificates, if any, which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented the holders Company Common Shares ("
_Certificates_ "), or in the case of Company Common Shares held in non-
certificated form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), pursuant to customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents" message in accordance with the
instructions set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and (y) the delivery of
a Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent and (B) instructions for
surrendering Certificates, if any, in exchange for the Transaction
Consideration.

 

(ii) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)(i)_,
together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documents
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of that Certificate
shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
therefor, the Transaction Consideration payable in respect of the number of
Company Common Shares evidenced by that Certificate. Any Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates.

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate but may, if required by the Exchange Agent, be required
to deliver an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive
the Transaction Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_. Each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares whose Company Common Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Transaction Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_ shall
automatically upon the Effective Time or following the Exchange Agents
receipt of the applicable Letter of Transmittal (or, at any later time at
which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after such time, the Transaction Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

(iv) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Transaction Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to the payment of such
Transaction Consideration to such transferee (including the payment of any
cash constituting a part thereof to such transferee and the registration of
any Parent Common Shares constituting a part thereof in the name of such
transferee), that (A) the surrendered Certificate be accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the
Person requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2)
establishes to the satisfaction

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 7 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  of Parent and the Exchange Agent that any such Taxes have already been paid
or are not applicable.

 

(v) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_,
each Company Common Share (other than any Dissenting Share or Excluded Share)
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Transaction Consideration and, in the case of
Dissenting Shares, the right to receive the Appraised Fair Value in
accordance with (and subject to the terms of) _Section 2.3_. The Transaction
Consideration paid in respect of each Company Common Share upon the surrender
of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Common Shares previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(e) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All Parent Common
Shares to be paid as a portion of the Transaction Consideration shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to the Parent Common Shares shall
be paid to any holder of any unexchanged Company Common Shares in respect of
any Parent Common Shares that the holder thereof has the right to receive
upon the surrender thereof until the instructions for transfer and
cancellation provided in this _Article II_ and in accordance with the terms of
the Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, have been
delivered to the Exchange Agent, and then shall only be paid if and to the
extent they relate to the Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor
and are payable to holders of Parent Common Shares as of a record date that is
as of or after the Effective Time and prior to the date of such issuance.

 

(f) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in respect of a
holders Company Common Shares or an Award Holders Awards, no dividends or
other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent with respect thereto. In lieu
of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company
Common Shares or Awards an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fractional share interest of any Parent Common Share to
which such holder (after taking into account all Company Common Shares
surrendered by such holder or such holders Awards, as applicable) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average Parent Share Price.

(g) _No Further Transfers_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
register of members of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(h) _Required Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Transaction
Consideration payable under this Agreement and from the Special Dividend, in
cash or in kind, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Laws or (iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 8 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  amounts are so deducted and withheld, those amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or
withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

(i) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws under this Agreement, and any such amounts will be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this  _Article II_ ;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
of issuers organized under the laws of a state of the United States of
America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $3 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be paid
promptly to Parent. Unless otherwise required by law for U.S. federal, state,
local and foreign Tax purposes, the parties shall treat any interest and other
income from the Exchange Fund as having been earned by Parent.

 

(k) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who has not complied with this _Article II_ shall look
only to Parent for payment of the applicable Transaction Consideration.

(l) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
in the form reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay the Transaction
Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

Section 2.3 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and, unless otherwise required by any
applicable Law or Order, converted into the right to receive the Standard
Election Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(c)_, and any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of a Dissenting
Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda, under Section 106(6) of
the Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is greater than the
Standard Election Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from
the Company by payment made within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair
Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. In the event
that a holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any
right to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_ "), such holders
Company Common Shares shall be

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 9 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  canceled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Transaction Consideration for each such Company Common Share; _provided_ ,
that any holder that makes an Appraisal Withdrawal prior to the Election
Deadline shall have the right to submit an Election in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_ for the applicable Company Common Shares held by such
holder, and any holder that makes an Appraisal Withdrawal after the Election
Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Standard Election in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)(iii)_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written
notice of (A) any demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or Appraisal
Withdrawals received by the Company and (B) to the extent that the Company has
Knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, the opportunity to participate with the Company in, and to be
regularly consulted by the Company with respect to (including as to the making
of any settlement offers by the Company), any settlement negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to settle, or settle, any
such demands or applications.

(a) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, or such earlier date
as contemplated in this _Section 2.4_, the Company Board or the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to (i)
terminate each of the Company Equity Plans, unless Parent, in its sole and
absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain such Company Equity Plans
by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least ten
(10) days before the Effective Time and (ii) effectuate the provisions of
this _Section 2.4_ so as to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person
shall have any rights under the Company Equity Plans except for the right to
receive the payments, if any, contemplated in this  _Section 2.4_.

(b) _Company Share Options_. Immediately prior to the earlier of the Election
Form Record Date and the record date for the Special Dividend (the " _Option
Exercise Date_ "), each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Shares
granted by the Company under the Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Company
Share Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed exercised (on a
net exercise basis) as of the Option Exercise Date (with no action required on
the part of the holder of the Company Share Option), and the holders of such
Company Share Options shall be entitled to make the Election and receive the
Special Dividend, in each case, with respect to the net number of Company
Common Shares deliverable to such holders upon such exercise. Any Company
Share Options outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be automatically
terminated and forfeited for no consideration, and all rights with respect to
such Company Share Options shall terminate as of the Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company Equity Plans_ " are the Company
2002 Share Incentive Plan, the Company 2006 Share Incentive Plan, the Company
2010 Share Incentive Plan and the Company Amended and Restated Executive
Incentive Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of Company Common
Shares with respect to which an Election may be made pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(b)_ shall be included for all purposes of calculating the Number
of Cash Elections, the Number of Share Elections and the Number of Standard
Elections, as applicable, that have been made (or deemed to have been made)
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

and non-forfeitable and shall be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions
of _Section 2.2_, the Share Election Consideration, the Cash Election
Consideration or the Standard Election Consideration. Each holder of a Company
Restricted Share Award shall be entitled to receive the Special Dividend with
respect to the number of Company Common Shares underlying each such Company
Restricted Share Award.

 

(d) _Company Restricted Share Units_.

 

(i) _Company Time-Based Restricted Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding time-based Company restricted share unit granted by the Company
under any Company Equity Plan (a " _Company Time-Based RSU_ "), vested or
unvested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions
of _Section 2.2_, the Share Election Consideration, the Cash Election
Consideration or the Standard Election Consideration with respect to the
number of Company Common Shares underlying such Company Time-Based RSU. Each
holder of a Company Time-Based RSU shall be credited with a dividend
equivalent payment equal to the amount of the Special Dividend multiplied by
the number of Company Common Shares underlying such Company Time-Based RSU,
which dividend equivalent payment shall be paid on the day prior to the
Closing Date.

(ii) _Company Market-Based Restricted Share Units_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding market-based restricted share unit granted by the Company

election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.2_, the Share Election Consideration, the Cash Election
Consideration or the Standard Election Consideration with respect to the "

Effective Time multiplied by the quotient of (A) the average of the closing
prices of the Company Common Shares on the NYSE for the twenty (20) trading
days ending on the date immediately preceding the Effective Time, as adjusted
by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the terms of the Company
2010 Share Incentive Plan and any applicable award agreements, to reflect the
Special Dividend, calculated pursuant to the principles, practices and
methodologies set forth in _Section 2.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
divided by (B) the average of the closing prices of the Company Common Shares
on the NYSE for the twenty (20) trading days ending on the last day of the
fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of grant of the Company MSUs,
subject to any maximum or minimum limitations set forth in the individual
award agreement. Each holder of a Company MSU shall be credited with a
dividend equivalent payment equal to the amount of the Special Dividend
multiplied by the number of MSU Achieved Shares underlying such Company MSU,
which dividend equivalent payment shall be paid on the day prior to the
Closing Date.

under the Company Amended and Restated Executive Incentive Plan (a " _Company
EIP Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and converted

number of EIP Achieved Shares multiplied by (B) the sum of (x) the Standard
Cash Amount plus (y) the product of the Standard Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the closing price of Parent Common Shares on the NYSE as of the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, which amount shall be adjusted as
determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the terms of the
Company Amended and Restated Executive Incentive Plan and any applicable
award agreements, to take account of the Special Dividend, calculated pursuant
to the principles, practices and methodologies set forth in _Section 2.4_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _EIP

limitations set forth in applicable award agreements or the Company Amended
and Restated Executive Incentive Plan, equal to the product of the total
number of share units subject to such Company EIP Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time (1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the applicable performance period prior to the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days during the
performance period, multiplied by (2) a performance factor determined as set
forth in the applicable award agreement and the Company Amended and
Restated Executive Incentive Plan.

event, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, or,

tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or

Code), (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement (as defined in Section

required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA or any other
applicable Law.

(e) There has been no amendment to, or announcement by, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, any of the U.S. Benefit Plans that would result
in a material increase in liabilities to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval and adoption of this Agreement, receipt of
approval or clearance from any one or more Governmental Entities in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Transactions, alone or in combination with any other
event, will (w) entitle any Employees, directors or consultants of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance or other payment, or increase any
compensation or benefits due (other than severance pay required by applicable
Law), (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or
benefits under, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits payable,
under any Benefit Plan, (y) result in payments that would individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(l) of the Code or be non-deductible

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the
Transactions, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate
any Benefit Plan. Except as disclosed in _Section 3.17(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to, or is otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that provides for the gross-up of a Tax, interest or penalties
imposed by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state or local Law). 

(f) All of the material Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed in _Section
3.17(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and have been funded, established,
maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with their
respective terms and all applicable Law (including compliance with any
applicable requirements with respect to registration and good standing
with regulatory authorities) and have been approved by any applicable
taxation authorities for favorable taxation status to the extent such approval
is available (and, to the Knowledge of the Company, circumstances do not exist
that are reasonably likely to cause such

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 26 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  approval to cease to apply). The Company and its Subsidiaries have no
material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Non-U.S. Benefit Plans

other hand, or any Orders by, or supervisory letters or cease-and-desist
orders from, any Governmental Entity, nor have any of the Parent Insurance

responsible for obtaining such amendment and any related waivers or consents;
it being understood that, subject to the proviso to the immediately foregoing
sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at
Parents reasonable request, assist Parent in obtaining any such amendment,
waiver or consent under the Company Credit Facilities or the Senior Note

and the Company each shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,

Affiliates, as the case may be, from any third party or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions. If Parent or the Company receives a
request for information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity that is related to the Transactions, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. Parent and its Affiliates shall advise the Company prior to making
or entering into any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) in connection with the Transactions with the Federal Trade

---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 55 |  | 
   |  |  |  | (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event
that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably

of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions, any and all reasonable
steps necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such
consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement;

_provided_ , that nothing herein shall require (and reasonable best efforts
shall in no event require) any party or its Affiliates commence any Legal
Action, or require Parent or any of its Affiliates to agree to or to take or
refrain from taking any action that would, individually or in the aggregate
with any other actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions
or requirements, result in or constitute a Burdensome Condition.

Company Vote (but not thereafter), in response to a bona fide written Takeover
Proposal not solicited in violation of, and that did not otherwise result from
a breach of, this  _Section 5.9_:

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person who has made such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal,
if the Company Board determines (x) in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and Outside Legal Counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and
(y) after consultation with its Outside Legal Counsel, that the failure to do
so would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;

 

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives), if the Company Board determines (x) in good faith,

such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with its Outside Legal Counsel,
that failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, but only so long as the Company has caused such Person
to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (negotiations and
discussions with respect to which are expressly permitted following the

has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; or

publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (B) cause or permit
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ in order
to concurrently enter into an agreement regarding a Superior Proposal, if,
the case of (A) and (B) above, the Company

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 57 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  Board determines (I) in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and Outside Legal Counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (II) after consultation with Outside Legal Counsel,
that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (B) above, unless and until (1) it is four (4)
Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
or the Company, as applicable, intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of any Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board or the
Company, as applicable and, if applicable, a statement that the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial or other material
terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new four (4) Business Day period during which the Company shall
comply with the terms of this _Section 5.9_), and (2) during such four (4)
Business Day period following Parents receipt of a Notice of Superior
Proposal, in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
to cause or permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement, (x)
the Company shall have provided Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transactions so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal
and, if Parent, in its sole discretion, proposes to make such adjustments,
shall negotiate with Parent in good faith with respect thereto, and (y) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith at the end of such notice
period and, after considering the results of such negotiations and the
revised proposals made by Parent, if any, and after consultation with its
financial advisor and Outside Legal Counsel, that the Superior Proposal giving
rise to such Notice of Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties
under applicable Laws. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change,
unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with _Article
VII_ , (i) the Company shall hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, and nothing contained herein
shall relieve the Company of such obligation and (ii) the Company Proxy
Statement and any and all accompanying materials may include appropriate
disclosure with respect to such Adverse Recommendation Change if and to the
extent the Company Board determines after consultation with Outside Legal
Counsel that the failure to include such disclosure would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by, or communication to, the Company or
its Representatives) upon receipt of (i) any Takeover Proposal or indication,
proposal or offer by any Person that could reasonably result in a
Takeover Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in
the ordinary course of business and unrelated to a Takeover Proposal, and
shall provide Parent with the identity of such Person and a description of
the material terms of such Takeover Proposal, indication, proposal, offer or
request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
of the status of any such Takeover Proposal, indication, proposal, offer or
request, and any related communications to or by the Company or its
Representatives (including notifying Parent no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt by or communications to or 

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 58 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  from, the Company or its Representatives of any material changes or other
action with respect thereto). The Company shall not enter into any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract that would prohibit the Company
from providing any information to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.9_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board shall be
permitted, in response to an Intervening Event, to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and Outside Legal Counsel, that
failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under this _Section
5.9(e)_, until (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to Parent that the Company Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor and including a
reasonably detailed description of the applicable Intervening Event, and (ii)
during the four (4) Business Day period following Parents receipt of such

Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company shall have provided Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to make any adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Transactions in response to such Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change and, if Parent, in its sole discretion, proposes to make
such adjustments, shall negotiate with Parent in good faith with respect
thereto, and (B) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith at the
end of such notice period and, after considering the results of such
negotiations and the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, and after
consultation with its financial advisor and Outside Legal Counsel, that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to violate
its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board shall be permitted to
disclose to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule

   |  |  |  |  communicating the compensation and employee benefits to be provided to the
Continuing Employees generally following the Effective Time and, to the extent
such communication is made prior to the Effective Time, will provide the
Company with a copy of such communication in advance.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting (other than for purposes
of equity grants by Parent made after the Effective Time) and the level of
benefit and benefit accrual under the employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing
Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with such Continuing Employees service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, or other welfare benefits to any Continuing
Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be
waived, for such Continuing Employee and such Continuing Employees covered
dependents, any evidence of insurability requirements, all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan, to
the extent such conditions were inapplicable, satisfied or waived under the
comparable Old Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and such Continuing Employees covered
dependents under each Old Plan during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out of pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and such
Continuing Employees covered dependents for the applicable plan year.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and any successor
thereto to honor, assume, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under the Benefit Plans listed on _Section 5.12(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the Continuing
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent
shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

(e) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, any Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_401(k) Plans_ "), unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees
to sponsor and maintain such 401(k) Plans by providing the Company with
written notice of such election at least ten (10) Business Days before the
Effective Time. Unless Parent provides such notice to the Company, Parent
shall receive from the Company, prior to the Effective Time, evidence that the
Company Board has adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k)

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 61 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to
review of Parent and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments
made by Parent or its representatives regarding the content of such
resolutions), effective no later than the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date. In the event that the distributions of assets from the trust of
a 401(k) Plan which is terminated is reasonably anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed
upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or
upon any Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to the Effective Time.
The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably require. If Parent, in its sole
and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan, the
Company shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries) to amend such 401(k) Plan,
effective as of the Effective Time, to the extent necessary to limit
participation to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to exclude
all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) from participation in such plan, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent must give the Company written notice of its decision to sponsor and
maintain any such 401(k) Plan at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated
as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit
plan or arrangement, (ii) limit the right of Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit
Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the
Effective Time, (iii) confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to
continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
Affiliate of Parent, or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent and
the Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary or other
right (including, but not limited to, a right to employment or continued
employment) in any Person, including any current or former director, employee
or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any
participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).

Section 5.13  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation existing on the
date of this Agreement in favor of any present or former director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents, in agreements between an
Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in
effect on the date of this Agreement to survive the Merger and to continue in
full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time, or, if longer,

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 62 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an
Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent shall
guarantee such performance by the Surviving Company. 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, indemnify
all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws
with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their
services as directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring
prior to the Effective Time. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved
in any Legal Action in connection with any matter occurring prior to or at
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall, jointly and
severally, pay as incurred such Indemnified Partys legal fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parents
or the Surviving Companys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party, if and only to the extent required by
applicable Law, to repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified.

 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, maintain in
effect for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time so
long as Parent and the Surviving Company are not required to pay an annual
amount of premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (such 300%
amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent or the Surviving Company
are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an
amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. At
the request of Parent, the Company shall prior to the Effective Time
purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for its existing policy of directors and
officers liability insurance, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and
conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If
such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be
deemed to satisfy all obligations pursuant to this  _Section 5.13(c)_ and
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(d) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with, amalgamates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 63 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, shall succeed to the obligations of such entity set forth in this _Section
5.13_.

 

Section 5.14 _Public Announcements_. Unless and until an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred or in connection with  _Section 5.9(c)_
or as contemplated by the next sentence, Parent and the Company shall (A)
consult with each other before issuing, and shall give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or otherwise making
any public statements about this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (B)
include in such press release or public statement all comments reasonably
requested by the other party and reasonably acceptable to the party proposing
the release or public statement, and (C) not issue such press release or
public statement prior to receiving the approval of the other party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and approval, except to the extent
required by applicable Laws or NYSE requirements, in which case that party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before
issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Parent and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Common Shares to be de-
listed from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act promptly
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.16 _Special Dividend_. Subject to applicable Laws:

 

(a) Following the date of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
holders of Company Common Shares constituting the Requisite Company Vote at
the Company Shareholders Meeting and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall declare and pay a special dividend of $10.00 per Company Common Share
(the " _Special Dividend_ ") payable to holders of record of
outstanding Company Common Shares as of a record date for the Special
Dividend set by the Company Board. The Company shall cause the Special
Dividend to be paid prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number
of outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Special Dividend shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 5.16_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 5.17 _Fees, Expenses and Transfer Taxes_.

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses (including those
payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its
behalf in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (" _Expenses_ ")
shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses, except that (i) Parent
and the Company shall share equally each of the filing fees with respect to
the filings contemplated by _Section 5.8(a)_ (other than with respect to the
filings and registrations required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or
the Company in 

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 64 |  | 
   |  |  |  |  connection with the HSR Act and applicable foreign antitrust or competition
law, which filing fees shall be paid by Parent) and (ii) and the registration
and filing fees and the printing and mailing costs of the Parent Registration
Statement shall be paid by Parent.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in  _Article II_ , all
share transfer taxes, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes
(including interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") (if any) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent or the Surviving
Company and fifty percent (50%) by the Company, and, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in preparing,
executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

Section 5.18 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, each of
Parent and the Company and their respective boards of directors shall (a) take
all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such Takeover Statute.

 

Section 5.19 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time and in consultation
with Parent, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is
a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.20 _Passive Foreign Investment Company_. On or after the Closing,
Parent, the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall not take
any action (and Parent shall cause its Affiliates not to take any action),
outside of transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business of
the Surviving Company and its respective Subsidiaries in accordance with past
practices of the Company, that would cause the Company to be treated as a
"passive foreign investment company" (as defined in Section 1297 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) in the taxable year of the Company in
which the Closing occurs. The preceding sentence shall not apply if (i) a
valid and timely election under Section 338(g) of the Code is made to treat
the Merger contemplated by this Agreement as an acquisition of the assets of
the Company, (ii) a valid and timely election under Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-3 is made to change the classification of the Company to an
entity disregarded as a separate entity from its sole owner effective the day
after the Closing Date, the election results in the closing of the Companys
Taxable year for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries engages in any transactions outside the
ordinary course of business after the Closing on the Closing Date, or (iii)
any other transaction resulting in an ending of the tax year of the Company on
the Closing Date for U.S. federal income Tax purposes is effected.

order to obtain the payment Parent commences a Legal Action that results in a
judgment against the Company for such payment, the Company shall pay Parent
for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such Legal Action, together
with any interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall

waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this
Agreement, or (c) subject to applicable Laws, waive compliance with any of the
covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part
of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

 

Section 7.9 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. In
order to be effective, (a) any termination or amendment of this Agreement
shall require the prior approval of that action by the board of directors of
each party seeking to terminate or amend this Agreement and (b) any extension

Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and

all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, warranty,
inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this
Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties to this
Agreement. Each party hereby disclaims any other representation, warranty or
inducement, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
other information made by, or made available by, itself or any of its
Representatives, with respect to, or in connection with, the negotiation,

contemplated by _Section 5.13(d)_) and (b) if the Effective Time occurs, the
holders of Company Common Shares, who will have the right to receive
Transaction Consideration pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of,

upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties in accordance with _Section 7.8_ and  _Section
7.9_ without notice or liability to any other Person. Persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.9 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to substitute a suitable and equitable provision for
that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or
the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.

     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  | 74 |  |

representations and warranties made with respect to such Subsidiary as of the
date of such designation, _mutatis mutandis_.

 

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the discretion
of the Chosen Courts, the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or violations of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in any Chosen Court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Moreover, and in
recognition of the foregoing, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance of this
Agreement that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under
any law for any party to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. If, prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings any
Legal Action in accordance with _Section 8.4_ to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End
Date shall be automatically extended (x) for the period during which such
action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (y) by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may
be.

following consideration:



     | (a) |

for each Company Common Share with respect to which the Standard Election is

the Plan of Merger, the Cash Election Consideration. Pursuant to the Plan of
Merger, the "Cash Election Consideration" shall mean either (A) if the

Cash Election Amount), or (B) if the Unprorated Aggregate Share Consideration
is less than the Aggregate Share Consideration, (1) an amount of cash equal to
the sum of (x) the Standard Cash Amount and (y) the Cash Oversubscription
Amount, and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable

Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Share Consideration, (1) a number

the sum of (x) the Standard Exchange Ratio and (y) the Share Oversubscription
Amount, and (2) an amount of cash equal to the difference between (I) the

and the Parent Share Price. 
---|---|--- 

(iv) All Company Common Shares shall be canceled automatically and shall cease

the Appraised Fair Value in accordance with (and subject to the terms of)
Section 2.3 of the Plan of Merger.

any applicable Law or Order, converted into the right to receive the Standard

and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of
a Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda, under
Section 106(6) of the Companies Act (Appraised Fair Value) is greater than the
Standard Election Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from
the Company by payment within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair
Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. In the event
that a holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any
right to appraisal (each, an Appraisal Withdrawal), such holders
Company Common Shares shall be canceled and converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration for each such
Company Common Share; provided, that any holder that makes an Appraisal
Withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline shall have the right to submit an
Election in accordance with Section 2.2(c) of the Plan of Merger for the
applicable Company Common Shares held by such holder, and any holder that
makes an Appraisal Withdrawal after the Election Deadline shall be deemed to
have made a Standard Election in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(iii) of the
Plan of Merger.



   7.2 | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in respect of a holders
Company Common Shares or an Award Holders Awards, no dividends or
other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent with respect thereto. In lieu of
such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company
Common Shares or Awards an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fractional share interest of any Parent Common Share to
which such holder (after taking into account all Company Common Shares
surrendered by such holder or such holders Awards, as applicable) would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average Parent Share Price.

less than seventy-five per cent (75%) of the issued shares of that class or

---|--- 



   6.2 | If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be
replaced without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity

Seal or signed by a Director, the Secretary or any person authorised by the
Board for that purpose. The Board may by resolution determine, either
generally or in any particular case, that any signatures on any such
certificates need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificates

need not be signed by any persons.

not, called or payable, at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms
of issue of such share in respect of such share, and the Company shall also
have a first and paramount lien on every share (other than a fully paid share)
standing registered in the name of a Shareholder, whether singly or jointly
with any other person, for all the debts and liabilities of such Shareholder
or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before
or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such
Shareholder, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same
shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are
joint debts or liabilities of such Shareholder or his estate and any other
person, whether a Shareholder or not. The Companys lien on a share shall
extend to all dividends payable thereon. The Board may at any time, either
generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare
any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Bye-Law.

C-9 fit, any share on which the Company has a lien but no sale shall be made
unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor
until the expiration of fourteen (14) days after a notice in writing, stating

intention to sell in default of such payment, has been served on the holder
for the time being of the share. 
---|--- 



   7.3 | The net proceeds of sale by the Company of any shares on which it
has a lien shall be applied in or towards payment or discharge of the debt or
liability in respect of which the lien exists so far as the same is presently
payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or
liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale)
be paid to the person who was the holder of the share immediately before such
sale. For giving effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person
to transfer the share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be
registered as the holder of the share and he shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the share be
affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the
sale. 
---|--- 



   8. | CALLS ON SHARES 
---|--- 



   8.1 | The Board may from time to time make calls upon the Shareholders
(for the avoidance of doubt excluding the Company in respect of any nil or
partly paid shares held by the Company as treasury shares) in respect of
any monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the par value of the
shares or by way of premium) and not by the terms of issue thereof made
payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue, and each
Shareholder shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least fourteen
(14) days notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to
the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on
his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the Board may determine.

have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the
call was passed. 
---|--- 
 



   8.3 | The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
---|--- 



   8.4 | If a sum called in respect of the share shall not be paid before
or on the day appointed for payment thereof the person from whom the sum is
due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for the
payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate as the Board may
determine, but the Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest
wholly or in part.

C-10 payable on allotment or at any date fixed by or in accordance with such terms
of issue, whether on account of the nominal amount of the share or by way
of premium, shall for all the purposes of these Bye-Laws be deemed to be a
call duly made, notified and payable on the date on which, by the terms of
issue, the same becomes payable and, in case of non-payment, all the relevant

otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call
duly made and notified.

---|--- 



   9.1 | If a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on
the day appointed for payment thereof, the Board may at any time thereafter
during such time as any part of such call or instalment remains unpaid
serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment
as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued. 
---|--- 



   9.2 | The notice shall name a further day (not being less than fourteen
(14) days from the date of the notice) on or before which, and the place
where, the payment required by the notice is to be made and shall state that,
in the event of non-payment on or before the day and at the place appointed,
the shares in respect of which such call is made or instalment is payable will
be liable to be forfeited. The Board may accept the surrender of any share
liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references in these Bye-
Laws to forfeiture shall include surrender. 
---|--- 



   9.3 | If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not
complied with, any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at
any time thereafter, before payment of all calls or instalments and interest
due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the
Board to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in
respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. 
---|--- 
 



   9.4 | When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall
be served upon the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the share
but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission
or neglect to give such notice as aforesaid. 
---|--- 



   9.5 | A forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the
Company and may be sold, re-offered or otherwise disposed of either to the
person who was, before forfeiture, the holder thereof or entitled thereto or
to any other person upon such terms and in such manner as the Board shall
think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the
forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Board may think fit. 
---|--- 
 



   9.6 | A person whose shares have been forfeited shall thereupon cease
to be a Shareholder in respect of the forfeited shares but shall,
notwithstanding the forfeiture, remain liable to pay to the Company all monies
which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company
in respect of the shares with interest thereon at such rate as the Board may
determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, and the Company may
enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for
the value of the shares forfeited.

by the Company as having any title to his shares; but nothing herein
contained shall release the estate of a deceased holder (whether the sole or
joint) from any liability in respect of any share held by him solely or
jointly with other persons. For the purpose of this Bye-Law, estate
representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration

nominee registered, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of
transfer of such share in favour of his nominee. All the limitations,
restrictions and provisions of these Bye-Laws relating to the right to
transfer and the registration of transfer of shares shall be applicable to
any such notice or instrument of transfer as aforesaid as if the death of the
Shareholder or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred
and the notice or instrument of transfer was an instrument of transfer signed
by such Shareholder. 
---|--- 



   13.3 | A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the
death of a Shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law shall (upon

Board as to his entitlement) be entitled to receive and may give a discharge
for any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the share, but he
shall not be entitled in respect of the share to receive notices of or to
attend or vote at general meetings of the Company or, save as aforesaid, to
exercise in respect of the share any of the rights or privileges of a
Shareholder until he shall have become registered as the holder thereof. The
Board may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be
registered himself or to transfer the share and, if the notice is not complied

the holding of one or more of its annual general meetings in the manner
permitted by the Companies Acts, the Board shall convene and the Company shall
hold general meetings as annual general meetings in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Acts at such times and places as the Board shall

the Companies Acts, convene general meetings other than annual general
meetings which shall be called special general meetings.

   17.2 | Except in the case of the removal of Auditors or Directors,
anything which may be done by resolution of the Shareholders in general
meeting or by resolution of any class of Shareholders in a separate general
meeting may be done by resolution in writing, signed by the Shareholders (or
the holders of such class of shares) who at the date of the notice of the
resolution in writing represent the majority of votes that would be required
if the resolution had been voted on at a meeting of the Shareholders. Such
resolution in writing may be signed by the Shareholder or its proxy, or in the
case of a Shareholder that is a corporation (whether or not a company within
the meaning of the Companies Acts) by its representative on behalf of such
Shareholder, in as many counterparts as may be necessary. 
---|--- 



   17.3 | Notice of any resolution in writing to be made under this Bye-
Law shall be given to all the Shareholders who would be entitled to attend a
meeting and vote on the resolution. The requirement to give notice of
any resolution in writing to be made under this Bye-Law to such Shareholders
shall be satisfied by giving to those Shareholders a copy of that resolution
in writing in the same manner that is required for a notice of a general
meeting of the Company at which the resolution could have been considered,
except that the length of the period of notice shall not apply. The date of
the notice shall be set out in the copy of the resolution in writing. 
---|--- 
 



   17.4 | The accidental omission to give notice, in accordance with this
Bye-Law, of a resolution in writing to, or the non-receipt of such notice by,
any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate the
passing of the resolution in writing.

   17.5 | For the purposes of this Bye-Law, the date of the resolution in
writing is the date when the resolution in writing is signed by, or on behalf
of, the Shareholder who establishes the majority of votes required for
the passing of the resolution in writing and any reference in any enactment
to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a resolution in
writing made in accordance with this Bye-Law, a reference to such date. 
---|--- 
 



   17.6 | A resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bye-Law is
as valid as if it had been passed by the Company in general meeting or, if
applicable, by a meeting of the relevant class of Shareholders of the
Company, as the case may be. A resolution in writing made in accordance with
this Bye-Law shall constitute minutes for the purposes of the Companies Acts
and these Bye-Laws.

Board may otherwise specify for the purpose, a proxy or (if a corporation) an
authorisation. Any standing proxy or authorisation shall be valid for all
general meetings and adjournments thereof or resolutions in writing, as the
case may be, until notice of revocation is received at the Registered Office
or at such place or places as the Board may otherwise specify for the purpose.
Where a standing proxy or authorisation exists, its operation shall be deemed
to have been suspended at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which
the Shareholder is present or in respect to which the Shareholder has
specially appointed a proxy or representative. The Board may from time to
time require such evidence as it shall deem necessary as to the due execution
and continuing validity of any standing proxy or authorisation and the
operation of any such standing proxy or authorisation shall be deemed to be
suspended until such time as the Board determines that it has received the
requested evidence or other evidence satisfactory to it.

convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case
or the case of a resolution in writing, in any document sent therewith) prior

person named in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case of a poll
taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, before the

as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall,
unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment

the meeting or other documents sent therewith) at least one hour before the
commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or the taking of the poll,
or the day before the effective date of any resolution in writing at which
the instrument of proxy or authorisation is used.

waive any of the provisions of these Bye-Laws related to proxies or

   34.1 | The Board may from time to time declare dividends or
distributions out of contributed surplus to be paid to the Shareholders
according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividends as
appear to the Board to be justified by the position of the Company. The

cash or shall be satisfied, subject to Bye-Law 36, in paying up in full shares
in the Company to be issued to the Shareholders credited as fully paid or
partly paid or partly in one way and partly the other. The Board may also pay
any fixed cash dividend which is payable on any shares of the Company half
yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the
opinion of the Board, justifies such payment. 
---|--- 



   34.2 | Except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue
of, any share otherwise provide: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | all dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus
may be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in
respect of which the dividend or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up
on a share in advance of calls may be treated for the purpose of this Bye-Law
as paid-up on the share; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus may be
apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the shares
during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend
or distribution is paid.

in cash, or any other sum payable in cash to the holder of shares may be paid
by cheque or warrant sent through the post or by courier addressed to
the holder at his address in the Register or, in the case of joint holders,
addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of
the shares at his registered address as appearing in the Register or addressed
to such person at such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing
direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders
otherwise direct, be made payable to the order of the holder or, in the case
of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the
Register in respect of such shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and
payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall
constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two (2) or more joint
holders may give effectual receipts for any dividends, distributions or other
monies payable or property distributable in respect of the shares held by such
joint holders.

  Bye-laws of Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. |  | 27 of 33 

C-31 unclaimed for a period of six (6) years from the date of declaration of such
dividend or distribution shall be forfeited and shall revert to the Company
and the payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend, distribution,
interest or other sum payable on or in respect of the share into a separate
account shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof. 
---|--- 
 



   34.7 | The Board may also, in addition to its other powers, direct
payment or satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of contributed
surplus wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets, and in
particular of paid-up shares or debentures of any other company, and where
any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board
may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in particular, may authorise any
person to sell and transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions altogether,
and may fix the value for distribution or dividend purposes of any such
specific assets and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any
Shareholders upon the footing of the values so fixed in order to secure
equality of distribution and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as
may seem expedient to the Board, provided that such dividend or distribution
may not be satisfied by the distribution of any partly paid shares
or debentures of any company without the sanction of a Resolution. 
---|--- 



   35. | RESERVES 
---|--- 

The Board may, before declaring any dividend or distribution out
of contributed surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as reserves
which shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose of
the Company and pending such application may, also at such discretion, either
be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments
as the Board may from time to time think fit. The Board may also without
placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which it may think it
prudent not to distribute.

 

CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS



   36. | CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS 
---|--- 



   36.1 | The Board may from time to time resolve to capitalise all or any
part of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or
fund which is available for distribution or to the credit of any
share premium account and accordingly that such amount be set free for
distribution amongst the Shareholders or any class of Shareholders who would
be entitled thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in the same
proportions, on the footing that the same be not paid in cash but be applied
either in or towards paying up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares
in the Company held by such Shareholders respectively or in payment up in full
of unissued shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company, to be
allotted and distributed credited as fully paid amongst such Shareholders, or
partly in one way and partly in the other, provided that for the purpose of
this Bye-Law, a share premium account may be applied only in paying up
of unissued shares to be issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid. 
---|--- 
 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bye-laws of Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. |  | 28 of 33 

C-32 under this Bye-Law, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient and,
in particular, may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or
may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable
in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions
altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any
Shareholders in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem
expedient to the Board. The Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of
the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary
or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be
effective and binding upon the Shareholders. 
---|--- 

RECORD DATES

 



   37. | RECORD DATES 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bye-Laws, the Company may

dividend, distribution, allotment or issue and for the purpose of identifying

any general meeting. Any such record date may be on or at any time before or
after any date on which such dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is
declared, paid or made or such notice is despatched.

office of the Company in Bermuda such records as will enable the Directors to

the end of each three (3) month period. No Shareholder (other than an Officer
of the Company) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book
or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the
Board or by Resolution.

in the discharge of his duties and the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law
shall extend to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the
reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or
trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election PROVIDED
ALWAYS that the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law shall not extend to any
matter which would render it void pursuant to the Companies Acts. 
---|--- 



   42.2 | No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for the
acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person.

Person.

   42.6 | The advance of moneys shall not be paid unless the advance is
duly authorised upon a determination that the indemnification of the

standard of conduct which entitles the Indemnified Person to indemnification
and further the determination referred to above must be made by a majority
vote of the Board at a meeting duly constituted by a quorum of Directors not
party to the proceedings in respect of which the indemnification is, or would
be, claimed; or, in the case such meeting cannot be constituted by lack of
