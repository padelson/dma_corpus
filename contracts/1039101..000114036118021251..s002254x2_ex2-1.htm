If Seller has not notified Buyer of an Objection within the Review Period then
the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the parties and
shall become final, binding and conclusive. Seller and Buyer shall, within
thirty (30) days (or such longer period as Seller and Buyer may agree in

Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences, all such

cooperate fully with Seller and its Representatives in connection with such
review, including providing on a timely basis all other information and copies
of records or other documents necessary or useful in connection with the
review of the Closing Statement as is requested by Seller and its
Representatives.

  

  

(d) If at the end of the Resolution Period Seller and Buyer have been unable
to resolve all differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Objection, Seller and Buyer shall refer all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Objection (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ")
to Grant Thornton LLP (or if such firm is unable or unwilling to accept such
engagement, an internationally recognized independent public accounting firm
that has not provided material services to either Seller or Buyer or their
respective Affiliates in the preceding three (3) years as jointly selected by
Seller and Buyer or, if Seller and Buyer are unable to agree within five (5)
Business Days from the end of the Resolution Period, then such internationally
recognized independent public accounting firm jointly selected by Seller's and
Buyer's independent accountants within five (5) Business Days thereafter)
(such firm, as finally selected, the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Seller and Buyer
each agree to promptly sign an engagement letter, in commercially reasonable
form, as may reasonably be required by the Accounting Firm. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other
party on the same day), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the
engagement of the Accounting Firm, a memorandum (a " _Submission_ ") (which
may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions with
respect to the Unresolved Matters. Each of Buyer and Seller may (but shall not
be required to) submit to the Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the
other party on the same day), within twenty (20) Business Days after the date
of the engagement of the Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to
Submission submitted to the Accounting Firm by the other party. Unless
requested by the Accounting Firm in writing, no party hereto may present any
additional information or arguments to the Accounting Firm, either orally or
in writing. None of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the
Accounting Firm regarding the subject matter hereof without the other party's
prior written consent. The Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access to
all relevant records of the Business to calculate the Closing Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to calculate,
based solely on the Submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, and only with respect to the Unresolved Matters submitted and
without independent investigation, whether and to what extent the Closing
Statement requires adjustments and shall be instructed that its calculation
(A) must be made in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Agreed Accounting Principles, without regard to principles of equity, and (B)
with respect to each Unresolved Matter, must be within the range of values
established for such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned
to such amount in the Submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand. Seller and Buyer shall request the Accounting Firm to (i)
submit its final written determination to Seller and Buyer as soon as
practicable, but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the
Accounting Firm's engagement, and (ii) prepare the Final Closing Statement
(which shall be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final
determination of the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate
the Final Purchase Price based on such Final Closing Statement. The Accounting
Firm's final written determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Seller
and Buyer, absent manifest error. The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be
(i) in the event that no Objection is delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer
to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_ , (ii) in the event that an Objection
is delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section
2.10(a)_ as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Seller and Buyer in writing
or (iii) in the event that an Objection is delivered by Seller to Buyer prior
to the expiration of the Review Period and Seller and Buyer are unable to
agree on all matters set forth in such Objection, the Closing Statement
delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.10(a)_ as adjusted by the
Accounting Firm to be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final
determination of the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters in accordance
with this _Section 2.10(d)_. In the event the Final Closing Statement is
determined (x) pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, Buyer shall prepare the Final Closing Statement and calculate the
Final Purchase Price, in each case, in strict accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and deliver such items to Seller within three (3) Business
Days following the determination thereof or (y) pursuant to clause (iii) of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Accounting Firm shall prepare the
Final Closing Statement (which shall be consistent with the Resolved Matters
and the final determination of the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters)
and calculate the Final Purchase Price based on the Final Closing Statement,
in each case, in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
deliver such items to Seller and Buyer within three (3) Business Days
following the delivery of the final written determination of the Accounting
Firm to Seller and Buyer. The date on which the Final Closing Statement is
finally determined and delivered in accordance with this _Section 2.10(d)_ is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_ ".

  

 

27  

  

(e) Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.10_ for resolving disputes with respect to the calculation of Closing
Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit any party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by
the Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. The substance of
the Accounting Firm's determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent manifest error. It is the intent of the parties to have any
determination of Unresolved Matters by the Accounting Firm proceed in an
expeditious manner; _provided_ , _however_ , any deadline or time period
contained herein may be extended or modified by agreement of the parties, and
the parties agree that the failure of the Accounting Firm to strictly conform
to any deadline or time period contained herein shall not be a basis for
seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the Accounting Firm. Any
fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the Accounting Firm in respect
of its services pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ shall be shared by Seller and
Buyer so that Seller's share of such fees and expenses shall be in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount that is unsuccessfully disputed by Seller
bears to the total amount initially disputed by Seller.

  

  

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Enterprise Value, _plus_ :

  

  

(i) the lesser of (x) $5,000,000 and (y) Closing Date Cash as set forth in the
Final Closing Statement; _minus_

  

  

(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement; _minus_

  

  

(iii) the Closing Transaction Expenses; _plus_

  

  

(iv) the amount by which, if any, the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement) is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital; _provided_ , that no adjustment shall be included in calculating the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to this clause (v) if the Closing Date Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital by less than
$1,000,000; _minus_

  

  

(v) the amount by which, if any, the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement) is less than the Target Net Working
Capital; _provided_ , that no adjustment shall be included in calculating the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to this clause (v) if the Target Net Working
Capital exceeds the Closing Date Net Working Capital by less than $1,000,000.

  

  

If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay Seller (to one or more accounts designated by Seller) within
two (2) Business Days of the Determination Date, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars, free and clear of any
withholdings or other deductions, an amount in cash equal to the sum of such
difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price. If
the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then Seller
shall pay Buyer (to such account designated by Buyer) within two (2) Business
Days of the Determination Date, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in dollars, free and clear of any withholdings or other deductions, an
amount in cash equal to the sum of the absolute value of such difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price.

  

 

28  

  

SECTION 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
_Article II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under any tax Laws. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be promptly paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to making any such deduction or
withholding, Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice (and
not, in any event, less than ten (10) Business Days' notice), and, to the
extent permitted by Law, permit Seller an opportunity to provide Buyer or the
Sold Companies with certificates or other appropriate documentation to reduce
or eliminate the need for such deduction or withholding.

  

  

SECTION 2.12 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties agree to allocate the
Purchase Price (and any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) in accordance with the rules under Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Determination Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a draft Purchase Price
Allocation. If within sixty (60) days after Seller's receipt of the draft
Purchase Price Allocation Seller has not objected in writing to such draft
Purchase Price Allocation, it shall become final. In the event that Seller
objects in writing within such sixty- (60-) day period, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. Any issues with respect to the
Purchase Price Allocation which have not been finally resolved within sixty
(60) days following the Determination Date shall be referred to the Accounting
Firm, whose determination shall be final and binding upon the parties. To the
extent the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.10_ , the parties
shall amend the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect such adjustments. Buyer
and Seller shall file their Tax Returns (and IRS Form 8594, if applicable) on
the basis of such Purchase Price Allocation, as it may be amended pursuant to
this Agreement, and neither party shall thereafter take a Tax Return position
or any other position for applicable Tax purposes that is inconsistent with
such Purchase Price Allocation unless otherwise required pursuant to a final
"determination" as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

  

  

ARTICLE III 
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SELLER

  

  

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (whether or not the representations and warranties in this _Article

represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date as follows:

Seller) or a limited liability company (in the case of each of the Sold
Companies) duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of formation. Except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to materially and adversely affect the
Business, each Sold Company has all requisite power and authority to own its
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and in good standing in the jurisdictions in which the
ownership of its property or the conduct of the Business requires such
qualification or license. Parent and its Subsidiaries have all requisite power
and authority to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold the Purchased
Assets owned, leased or otherwise held by any of them and to conduct the
Business as presently conducted by it. Seller has made available to Buyer
true, correct and complete copies of the certificate of formation and
operating agreement (or other equivalent limited liability company agreement)
of each Sold Company, in each case, as amended and in effect on the date

29  

  

SECTION 3.2 _Authorization, Enforceability_. Each of Parent and Seller has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent and Seller has the power and
authority to execute and deliver each Closing Agreement to which it is a party

hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by Parent and Seller of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Parent and Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of Parent and Seller, and each of Parent and Seller shall duly execute and
deliver each Closing Agreement to which it is a party and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, this
Agreement constitutes, and each Closing Agreement shall constitute, a valid
and binding agreement of each of Parent and Seller, enforceable against Parent
and Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
(the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  

  

SECTION 3.3 _Capital Stock or Other Equity Interests of the Sold Companies_.
Set forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is (i) the
jurisdiction of formation and (ii) the number of authorized, issued and
outstanding shares or other equity securities of each Sold Company as of the
date hereof and, except as set forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, there are no other authorized, issued or outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Sold Companies. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all of the issued
and outstanding Sold Interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and are owned of record free and clear of any Encumbrances.
Seller has good and valid title to all of the Sold Interests. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding options, warrants, calls, rights or any other agreements affecting
the sale, issuance or voting of any shares of the capital stock of any of the
Sold Companies, or any securities or other instruments convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any shares of capital
stock of any of the Sold Companies. Other than as set forth on _Section 3.3_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or other similar Contracts in effect to which Parent or
Seller (with respect to the Business) or any Sold Company is a party, or by
which Parent or Seller (with respect to the Business) or any Sold Company is
bound, in each case, with respect to the governance of the Business or the
registration, voting or transfer of any Sold Interests. There will not be any
liability for, nor obligation with respect to, any dividends or distributions
declared or accumulated but unpaid with respect to any equity interests of any
Sold Company immediately following the Closing (other than dividends or
distributions payable by a Sold Company to another Sold Company). The copies
of the minute books of each Sold Company made available to Buyer contain
records of all material meetings and reflect all other material limited
liability company action of the equityholders and board of managers, as
applicable, of each Sold Company that occurred prior to the date hereof, and
such copies are correct and complete in all material respects.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 _Subsidiaries_. As of the Closing Date, no Sold Companies have any
Subsidiaries or own any Investments, except as set forth on _Section 3.4_ of

(a) Set forth on _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are the
audited combined balance sheets of the Business together with all notes and
schedules thereto as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and the
related combined statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss),
cash flows and changes in net parent company investment of the Business for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (the "
_Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements have been prepared from
the books and records of the Business and in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto).
The Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the combined
financial position and results of operations of the Business at the dates and
for the periods indicated.

  

  

(b) Each Sold Company has established and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP.

  

  

(c) _Section 3.5(a)_ is qualified by the fact that the Business has not
operated as separate "stand-alone" entity within Seller, including with
respect to Tax matters. As a result, Seller has, in good faith, allocated to
the Business certain charges and credits for purposes of the preparation of
the Financial Statements. Such allocations of charges and credits do not
necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted from arms-length
transactions or the actual costs that would be incurred if the Business
operated as a "stand-alone" entity. The allocation of charges and credits
contained in the Financial Statements and set forth on _Section 3.5(c)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule were made on a consistent basis in each period and
are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of the services received from
Seller by, or the benefits provided to, the Business for the period indicated
therein.

  

  

(d) Attached as _Schedule 3.5(d)_ are the unaudited consolidating balance
sheet, revenues and earnings before interest and taxes of the Business at and
for the quarter ended March 30, 2018. Such information was derived from the
books and records of the Business, has been prepared in good faith and fairly
presents in all material respects the unaudited consolidating balance sheet,
revenues and earnings before interest and taxes of the Business at March 30,
2018 and for the quarter then ended, in conformity with accounting methods
consistently applied for the period covered thereby.

  

  

SECTION 3.6 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Business does not have
any Liabilities of any kind whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise, and whether due or to become due) that are required to be
reflected on a combined balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, other
than Liabilities (a) reflected on, or reserved for in, the Financial
Statements, (b) arising in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
2017, (c) disclosed on _Section 3.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (d)
arising after the date of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions
or (e) that are not and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to materially and adversely affect the Business.

  

  

SECTION 3.7 _No Approvals or Conflicts; Governmental Authorizations_.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 3.7(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the execution, delivery and performance by Parent or Seller of this Agreement
and the Closing Agreements and the consummation by Parent and Seller of the
Transactions do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with the
organizational documents of Parent or Seller or any Sold Company, (ii)
violate, conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default by
any of the Sold Companies (or create an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) under any Material Contract, (iii)
result in the loss of a benefit or increase in Liabilities under, create in
any party the right to terminate, cancel or modify, or require any notice,
consent, approval, authorization or waiver under any Material Contract or
Permit to which any Sold Company is bound or to which any equity interest,
asset or property of the Business is subject, or (iv) violate or result in a
breach of any Order or Law applicable to Parent, Seller or the Sold Companies

and (iv) above, as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the

the execution, delivery and performance by Parent or Seller of this Agreement
and the Closing Agreements and the consummation by Parent and Seller of the
Transactions do not and will not require any filing or registration with any
Governmental Authority except for (i) filings in connection with the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws, (ii) filings or registrations with Governmental
Authorities that become applicable as a result of matters specifically related
to Buyer or its Affiliates or their operation or ownership of the Business,
(iii) notice filings under ITAR or (iv) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.

  

 

31  

  

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.7(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
no Government Contract will require novation by a Governmental Authority in
connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions.

under investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect to any actual
or alleged violation of any Laws or Orders at any time since January 1, 2015

Companies are bound or affected. Parent, Seller and the Sold Companies have
all licenses, permits, franchises, registrations and other governmental
authorizations necessary to conduct the Business substantially in the manner
in which the Business is currently conducted (collectively, " _Permits_ "),
and such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure have such Permits or for such Permits to be valid and in full force
and effect would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to materially adversely affect the Business. Parent, Seller and their
respective Subsidiaries (with respect to the Business) and the Sold Companies
are, and during the past three years have been, in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of such Permits.

  

  

SECTION 3.9 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Section 3.9_ of the Seller

ARTICLE IV 
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

  

  

Except as set forth in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Seller as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date as follows:

  

  

SECTION 4.1 _Organization_. Buyer is a limited liability company duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Buyer has all
requisite power and authority to own its assets and carry on its business as
now being conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business in the
jurisdictions in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification or license, except where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed would not be material to the business of Buyer.

  

  

SECTION 4.2 _Authorization, Enforceability_. Buyer has the corporate or other
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each Closing
Agreement to which it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and each
Closing Agreement to which it is a party, the performance by Buyer of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by Buyer of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer, and Buyer shall duly execute and deliver each Closing
Agreement to which it is a party and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by each other party thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and each
Closing Agreement shall constitute, a valid and binding agreement of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  

  

SECTION 4.3 _No Approvals or Conflicts; Governmental Authorizations_. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.3_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, the execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Closing Agreements
and the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions do not and will not (i)
violate or conflict with its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents, (ii) violate, conflict with or result in
a material breach of, or constitute a default by Buyer (or create an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under
any Contract to which Buyer or any of its properties may be bound, (iii)
violate or result in a material breach of any Order or Law applicable to Buyer
or any of its properties or (iv) except for applicable requirements of the HSR
Act and other Antitrust Laws, require any Consent of any Governmental
Authority.

  

 

43  

  

SECTION 4.4 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings or investigations by any
Governmental Authority pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates that challenge, or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, the ability of Buyer to consummate the
Transactions and each Closing Agreement to which it is a party. None of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates is subject to any Order that challenges, or may have
the effect of preventing, materially delaying, making illegal, or otherwise
materially interfering with, the ability of Buyer to consummate the
Transactions and each Closing Agreement to which it is a party.

  

  

SECTION 4.5 _Compliance with Law_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any Order or Law applicable to them or any of their
respective properties, except for violations the existence of which would not
reasonably be expected to impair or materially delay the ability of Buyer to
consummate the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 4.6 _Financial Resources_. Buyer has delivered to Seller: (a) a true,
accurate and complete copy of an executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), under which one or more
Affiliates of the Guarantor has committed to provide to Buyer equity financing
in an aggregate amount of $220,000,000, subject solely to the terms and
conditions set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "); and (b) a true,
accurate and complete copy of an executed commitment letter, including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, dated as of the date hereof, from the
Debt Financing Sources parties thereto (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and,
together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "),
under which such Debt Financing Sources have committed to provide debt
financing to Buyer in the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ")
and, together with the Equity Financing (the " _Financing_ "), subject solely
to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Buyer has also delivered to
Seller a true, accurate and complete copy of each fee letter related to the
Debt Financing as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Fee Letter_ ")
(provided, however, that the fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic
terms, and the "market flex" provisions may be customarily redacted, none of
which redacted provisions would adversely affect the conditionality,
availability, aggregate principal amount or termination of the Debt
Financing). The only condition precedent to the obligations of the parties
under the Commitment Letters is the satisfaction or the waiver of the
conditions set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter. As of the date
hereof, each Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn, rescinded, terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect (except for any increases in the amount of funds available thereunder
or the addition of Debt Financing Sources or other relevant entities who did
not execute such Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement) and no
such amendment or modification is contemplated except as permitted by this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, to
the actual knowledge of Buyer's officers) the other parties thereto except as
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. The Equity Commitment Letter
expressly provides, and shall continue to expressly provide, that Seller is an
intended third party beneficiary thereof for the purposes set forth therein.
There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the
Commitment Letters that would reasonably be expected to affect the
availability, the amount or conditionality of the Financing or would
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing. As of the date hereof, assuming
the truth and accuracy of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Buyer or, to the actual knowledge of Buyer's officers, any
other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters or
a failure of any condition to the Financing or otherwise result in any portion
of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. The proceeds from the
Financing, together with other amounts available to Buyer, are sufficient to
pay all amounts required to be paid by Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and to pay all of its fees and expenses in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing). Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ on the Closing
Date, as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that the
conditions to the Financing shall not be satisfied or that the full amount of
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters shall not be available as
of the Closing. Buyer has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the
date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, including without limitation this _Section 4.6_ , _Section 5.28_
and _Section 5.29_ , in no event shall the receipt by, or the availability of
any funds or financing to, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any other
financing be a condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder. The Debt Commitment Letter does not contain any
material misrepresentation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. As of the date
of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer
under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter, or otherwise result
in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (x) related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing or any provisions that could
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or (y) that could otherwise adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Debt Commitment Letter
with respect to all or any portion of the Debt Financing, other than as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to Seller.

  

 

44  

  

SECTION 4.7 _No Brokers ' or Other Fees_. No broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.

  

  

SECTION 4.8 _No Foreign Person_. The Transactions do not constitute a covered
transaction subject to a national security review, national security
investigation, or action by the President as prescribed in Section 721 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C. App. 2170, as amended by the Foreign
Investment and National Security Act of 2007. Further, except as set forth on
_Section 4.8_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or parents, nor any shareholder of or other investor
in any of Buyer or its Affiliates, is a foreign person or controlled or
influenced by a foreign person such that the Transactions would result in
foreign ownership, control, or influence of the Sold Companies as defined in
Chapter 2, Section 3 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating
Manual, DoD 5220.22-M (" _NISPOM_ ") or which would require the Sold Companies
to answer in the affirmative Questions 1, 4, or 10 of the Certificate
Pertaining to Foreign Interests (SF-328) as described in the NISPOM.

  

  

SECTION 4.9 _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Sold Interests
for its own account and solely for investment, with no intention to sell,
transfer or distribute any Sold Interests to any other Person. Buyer, either
alone or together with its advisors, has sufficient knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Sold Interests, and Buyer is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment and can afford to lose its
entire investment in the Sold Interests. Buyer acknowledges that it is
informed as to the risks of the Transactions and of ownership of the Sold
Interests. Buyer acknowledge that none of the Sold Interests are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or
under any state or foreign securities laws, and Buyer will not sell, transfer
or distribute any Sold Interests except in compliance with the registration
requirements or exemption provisions under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable securities
Law.

  

  

SECTION 4.10 _Investigation_. Buyer acknowledges that it has had the
opportunity to conduct an independent investigation and verification of the
current condition and affairs of the Sold Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities and the Business. Buyer acknowledges that it and its
advisors have been given the opportunity to examine records and other
information with respect to the Sold Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities and the Business, including the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers and management employees of the Business, and in
making the decision to enter into this Agreement and the Closing Agreements
and to consummate the Transactions, other than reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller set forth in
_Article III_ of this Agreement and the Closing Agreements, has relied solely
on its own independent investigation.

  

  

SECTION 4.11 _Buyer Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Guarantor has duly executed and delivered to Parent and
Seller the Buyer Guarantee, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor
of Parent and Seller in respect of certain of Buyer's obligations arising
under this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Buyer Guarantee is in full
force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding obligation of Guarantor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions, and, as of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Guarantor under the Buyer Guarantee.

  

  

SECTION 4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , neither Buyer
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty to Seller. Except as set forth in _Article III_ and in the Closing
Agreements, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates make or provide any
warranty or representation, express or implied, as to the quality,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose of the Sold Companies or the
Business or any assets or parts thereof.

with respect to the conduct of the Business as a result, nothing contained
herein shall give Buyer any right to manage, control, direct or be involved in
the management of Parent, Seller, the Sold Companies, the Purchased Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities or the Business prior to the Closing.

  

  

SECTION 5.2 _Access_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Parent and Seller
shall, and shall cause the Sold Companies to, (i) reasonably cooperate with
Buyer to facilitate the transition to Buyer on or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date of the IT systems and network used in
the operation of the Business or by the Sold Companies (provided that such
cooperation does not materially interfere with the Business or the business of
Seller), and (ii) afford to Buyer, through its authorized Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon prior reasonable
written notice to Seller, to the officers, properties, assets, Contracts,
financial information, books and records of the Sold Companies (including
working papers and data in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Sold Companies) or their respective accountants); _provided_
that such access does not materially interfere with the normal business
operations of Seller or the Sold Companies and shall not include any invasive
or destructive sampling or testing of any environmental medium or building
material; _provided_ , _further_ , Buyer shall not have access to personnel
records of Seller or its Affiliates relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information which in Seller's
good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject
Seller or any of its Affiliates to risk of Liability. If the foregoing access
involves entry onto any properties of the Sold Companies, (i) Seller shall be
entitled to have a Representative of Seller accompany Buyer or its authorized
Representatives at all times and (ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller
and its Affiliates, harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses that
they may incur arising out of or due to such access to the extent caused by
the failure of Buyer or its authorized Representatives to comply with the
material policies of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Seller and the Sold Companies shall not be required to
disclose (A) any information to Buyer if Seller believes in good faith that
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x) jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege or (y) violate any applicable Law or any contractual
confidentiality obligation of Parent or Seller, (B) information relating to
any sale or divestiture process conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for the
Business or Seller's or its Affiliates' (or their Representatives') evaluation
of the Business in connection therewith, including projections, financial or
other information relating thereto, or (C) any consolidated, combined, unitary
or similar Tax Return of which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Sold Companies) is the common parent or any other information relating to
Taxes or Tax returns other than information relating solely to the Sold
Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to design
and implement alternative disclosure arrangements and, to the extent
available, use such alternative disclosure arrangements to provide
information, documents and access to Buyer and its Representatives in a manner
that would not violate applicable Law, violate the confidentiality obligations
of any Contract or cause the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto. The parties agree that the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until the Closing, and all information obtained
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.3 _Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents_.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (i)
to consummate and make effective the Transactions, (ii) to obtain any Consent
of any Governmental Antitrust Authority required to be obtained or made by
Parent, Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated
by this Agreement, and (iii) to defend vigorously, lift, mitigate or rescind
the effect of any litigation or administrative proceeding involving any
Governmental Antitrust Authority (including a private party challenge)
adversely affecting this Agreement or the Transactions, including promptly
appealing any adverse court or administrative decision; _provided_ , _however_
, that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to make any material
monetary expenditure, commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation, retain,
sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Business or offer or grant any
material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person in order to
satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.3_.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement) file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if
any, required for the Transactions and to supply as promptly as practicable
any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the
HSR Act and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) make all filings
under the other Antitrust Laws on _Schedule 5.3(b)_ and shall take all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the other Antitrust
Laws. Any such antitrust notification and report form or filing and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable other Antitrust Laws, as the
case may be. All other regulatory filings shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of applicable Law. Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and
Parent and Seller, on the other hand, shall furnish to the other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act, the applicable Other Competition Laws or other
applicable Law, as the case may be. Each of Parent and Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use reasonable best efforts to
comply promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional information from
the FTC, the DOJ, other Governmental Antitrust Authorities and any other
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.

  

 

48  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in _Sections
5.3(a)_, _(b)_ and _(d)_ and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall each furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with this
_Section 5.3_ and shall each promptly provide counsel for the other party with
copies of all filings made by such party, and all correspondence between such
party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Antitrust Authority, other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, and any other information supplied by such party and such party's
Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Law, Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall each permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed written or, if practicable, oral
communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority relating to the Transactions. Each of Parent and Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust Authority or other
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, to take, or cause to be taken, any and all
actions, including the disposition of assets, required by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority as a condition to the granting of any Consent necessary
for the consummation of the Transactions or as may be required to avoid, lift,
vacate, reverse or resolve any legislative, administrative or judicial action
(including any suit instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the Antitrust Laws) that
would otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation of
the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
actions include, but are not limited to: (i) divesting, selling or otherwise
disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose
of, any entities, assets or facilities of the Sold Companies or included in
the Purchased Assets or any entity, facility or asset of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) terminating, amending or assigning any
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations, and (iii)
amending, assigning or terminating any existing licenses or other agreements
and entering into such new licenses or other agreements (and, in each case,
entering into agreements with the relevant Governmental Antitrust Authority
giving effect thereto) in each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) if such action is necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be
required by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as a condition to the
granting of any Consent necessary for the consummation of the Transactions or
as may be required to avoid, lift, vacate, reverse or resolve any legislative,
administrative or judicial action (including any suit instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of the Antitrust Laws) that would otherwise
reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation of the
Transactions; provided that any such action shall not be required or (without
consent of Seller, to the extent such action relates to the Sold Companies or
the Purchased Assets) permitted to be effective prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3(d)_ , nothing
contained in this Agreement shall require Buyer, or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, to take, or agree to take, any action or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining any Consent necessary from any
Governmental Antitrust Authority, that would reasonably be likely to have a
material and adverse effect on Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Closing hereunder (with materiality measured on a
scale relative to the Sold Companies and the Purchased Assets, taken as a
whole).

  

  

(e) The filing fees under the HSR Act, Antitrust Laws and other applicable
Laws, as well as the fees and disbursements of any legal counsel or other
advisor jointly retained by the parties in connection with any such filings
and any other filings with Governmental Authorities, shall be borne by Buyer.

  

  

(f) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
Pre-Closing Period, none of Parent, Seller, Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to not, take or agree to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the parties from obtaining any
Consent of any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, or
to prevent or delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions, including
any acquisition (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or
otherwise) of or agreement to acquire any amounts of assets of or any equity
in any other Person or any business or division thereof if such acquisition or
agreement would be reasonably expected to create a meaningful risk of making
it more difficult to obtain Consent of the FTC or the DOJ or any other
Governmental Antitrust Authority required in connection with the Transactions.

  

  

(g) Each of Parent and Seller agrees to introduce Buyer to Parent's and
Seller's Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ ") contact(s) within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof so that Buyer may present a Foreign
Ownership, Control or Influence (" _FOCI_ ") action plan to demonstrate that
it presents no unmitigated FOCI. Seller will reasonably cooperate, at no cost
to Parent, Seller or their respective Affiliates, with Buyers efforts to
ensure DSS agreement that there is no unmitigated FOCI.

  

  

(h) Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect as soon as
practicable the transfer or novation to the Sold Companies of all existing
export licenses and other authorizations under which the Sold Companies
operate.

  

 

49  

  

SECTION 5.4 _Third Party Consents_.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain any Consent of any Person (other than Governmental Antitrust
Authorities) required to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including obtaining each of the Consents set forth on _Schedule 5.4_ and
novation of each Government Contract set forth in _Section 3.7(c)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Buyer Novated Contract_ "). Each party
agrees to cooperate reasonably with the other in obtaining such Consents. To
the extent that the parties are unable to obtain any required third party
Consents prior to the Closing (such Consents, the " _Post-Closing Consents_
"), Parent and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to make or obtain (or cause
to be made or obtained), as promptly as practicable following the Closing, all
Post-Closing Consents.

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing, Seller shall prepare (with
Buyer's assistance, which will include preparation of all information and
documents required of the transferee for such requests), in accordance with
FAR Subpart 42.12, and any applicable agency regulations or policies, a
written request meeting the requirements of FAR Subpart 42.12, as reasonably
interpreted by the Responsible Contracting Officer (as such term is defined in
FAR Subpart 42.1202), which shall be submitted by the Seller to the
Responsible Contracting Officer, for the applicable Governmental Authority (i)
to recognize Buyer as Seller's successor-in-interest to each of the Buyer
Novated Contracts and (ii) to enter into a novation agreement (a " _Novation
Agreement_ "), in the form and substance as set forth in FAR Subpart
42.1204(i) which shall be deemed reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller,
pursuant to which, subject to the requirements of FAR Subpart 42.12, all of
Parent's, Seller's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' right, title and
interest in and to, and all of Parent's, Seller's and any of their respective
Subsidiaries' obligations and liabilities under each such Buyer Novated
Contracts shall be validly conveyed, transferred and assigned and novated to
Buyer by all parties thereto. Seller and Buyer shall each use all reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents, approvals and waivers required for the purpose
of processing, entering into and completing the Novation Agreements with
regard to each of the Buyer Novated Contracts, including responding to any
requests for information by a U.S. Governmental Authority with regard to such
Novation Agreements.

  

  

(c) Buyer and Seller shall collaborate regarding the information to be shared
with the Responsible Contracting Officer(s) prior to Closing, provided that
Seller shall have the ultimate right to determine what information will be
shared with the Responsible Contracting Officer(s) prior to Closing.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the transfer or assignment of the Buyer
Novated Contracts is subject to the Governmental Authority's approval of a
Novation Agreement recognizing Buyer as the successor-in-interest to Parent,
Seller or one of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be. Unless and
until the Governmental Authority recognizes Buyer as the successor-in-interest
to Parent, Seller or one of their respective Subsidiaries under the relevant
Buyer Novated Contracts, Parent, Seller and their respective Subsidiaries
shall subcontract to Buyer all of Parent's, Seller's or any of their
respective Subsidiaries' rights and obligations under such Buyer Novated
Contracts to the maximum extent permissible under law. In connection
therewith, Buyer shall perform on behalf of Parent, Seller and their
respective Subsidiaries all of their obligations under such Buyer Novated
Contracts in full compliance with those Contracts and applicable Laws, and
Parent's, Seller's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' shall promptly
remit to Buyer all payments Parent, Seller or one of their respective
Subsidiaries receives under such Buyer Novated Contracts with respect to
obligations performed by Buyer.

  

  

(e) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, the Seller agrees, to
the extent practicable and permitted by law, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid the inclusion in each of the Buyer Novated Contracts entered
into or Government Contract Bid submitted subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (each, a " _Subsequent Contract_ ") a provision prohibiting the
assignment of any Subsequent Contract to Buyer.

  

  

(f) Until such time as the relevant Government Authority recognizes the
transfer of the rights and obligations under any particular Government
Contract to the Buyer in accordance with, and to the extent required by, FAR
Subpart 42.12, the Buyer and Seller will enter into a pre-novation subcontract
under which, to the extent permissible under law, the Buyer will perform for
and in the place of the Seller any and all operations and provide any and all
goods, equipment, services and other performance obligations under such
Government Contract as of the Closing, pursuant to its respective terms and
conditions, including any and all amendments, options, modifications, purchase
orders issued thereunder and such other terms and conditions as may have been
duly incorporated in such Government Contract. The Buyer agrees to perform and
discharge each Government Contract in a timely manner and in accordance with
applicable law and with all of the terms of such Government Contract. In the
event that the relevant Government Authority declines to provide any required
consent to such pre-novation subcontract with respect to any particular
Government Contract, or that such pre-novation subcontract would otherwise
constitute a violation or breach of any particular Government Contract or any
applicable law with respect to any particular Government Contract, the Seller
will use its reasonable efforts to provide to the Buyer the benefits of the
applicable Government Contract, including by cooperating in any reasonable and
lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the Buyer and by
enforcing at the request and expense of the Buyer for its account, any rights
of the Transferor arising from any such Government Contract (including the
right to elect to terminate such contract in accordance with and to the extent
permitted by the terms thereof upon request of the Buyer). If and when any
required Government Authority recognizes the transfer of the rights and
obligations under any particular Government Contract to the Transferee, the
Seller will promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, all rights, obligations
and other liabilities thereunder to the Buyer without payment of any further
consideration, and the Buyer will assume such rights, obligations and other
liabilities thereunder without payment of any further consideration.

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance

to books and records, employees, contractors and Representatives, as
applicable) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the
making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for and response to
any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that if such requested information is contained within a document containing
any unrelated information, only portions pertaining to such relevant
information shall be furnished. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and
records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Sold Companies and Purchased
Assets until the expiration of all relevant statutes of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by Buyer and Seller, as the case may be, any extensions
thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall provide the other with
at least thirty (30) days prior written notice before destroying any such
books and records, during which period the party receiving such notice can
elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.

  

  

(b) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall (i) prepare and timely file (or cause to be

and (ii) timely pay all Taxes due and payable with respect to any such
Returns. All Seller Tax Return shall be prepared consistent with past
practice, except as required by applicable Law. Buyer shall prepare and timely
file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) any other Tax Returns of the
Sold Companies or with respect to the Purchased Assets (" _Buyer Tax Return_
"). To the extent any Buyer Tax Return includes a taxable period (or portion
thereof) for which Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ ,
(i) Buyer shall prepare and timely file any such Buyer Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as required by applicable Law and (ii)
Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of any such Buyer Tax Returns at least
thirty (30) days before the filing due date and Buyer shall make any changes
to such Buyer Tax Returns reasonably requested by Seller. All Seller Tax
deductions attributable to the payment of Transaction Expenses shall, insofar
as permissible, be reflected on Seller Tax Returns.

  

  

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause the provisions of any
agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any Tax
sharing agreements) between Seller, on the one hand, and any Sold Company, on
the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date no person shall have any rights or obligations under any such
agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes.

  

  

SECTION 5.6 _Tax Indemnity_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and its officers, directors,
employees, agents Representatives and Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Sold Companies) and hold each of them harmless against (i) any
Taxes of Seller, (ii) any Taxes of the Sold Companies or with respect to the
Purchased Assets for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and, with respect to any taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), any Taxes allocable (pursuant to

or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or
regulation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Tax indemnity
provided under this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall not cover Tax Liabilities (I)
resulting from any transaction engaged in, by, or with a Sold Company outside
the ordinary course of business that occurs after the Closing on the Closing

portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) Buyer's share of the
Transfer Taxes, if any, as set forth in _Section 5.17(b)_ , and (iii) that are
incurred by reason of Buyer's failure to perform any covenant or other
agreement of Buyer contained in _Section 5.5_ , this _Section 5.6_ , _Section
5.7_ or _Section 5.8_ hereof.

  

 

51  

  

(c) Payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount due under this _Section
5.6_ shall be made within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by
the Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
Authority is due; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required
to make any payment earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is due to
the appropriate Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.7_ below, payment of the Tax to
the appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier
than the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Taxing Authority or court.

  

  

(d) The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this _Section 5.6_ shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the Tax Liabilities in question; _provided_ , _however_ , if a party
seeking indemnity has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 5.6_ prior to such termination date, then such claim for such Loss
incurred (and only such claim for such Loss incurred), if then unresolved,
shall not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in this
_Section 5.6(e)_.

  

  

(f) Any disputes between the parties with respect to the Tax matters regarding
the Sold Companies in _Section 5.5_ , this _Section 5.6_ or _Section 5.7_
shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, whose fees and expenses shall be
shared in accordance with _Section 2.10(e)_.

  

  

(g) For purposes of Section 5.6(a), (i) real and personal property Taxes
(other than Transfer Taxes) for the taxable period that includes the Closing
Date shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer, with such Taxes being borne
by Seller based on the ratio of the number of days in the relevant period
prior to and including the Closing Date to the total number of days in the
actual taxable period with respect to which such Taxes are assessed, and being
borne by Buyer based on the ratio of the number of days in the relevant period
after the Closing Date to the total number of days in the actual taxable
period with respect to which such Taxes are assessed, irrespective of when
such Taxes are due, become a lien or are assessed; (b) sales and use Tax shall
be deemed to accrue as property is purchased, sold, used or transferred; and
(c) all other Taxes shall accrue by way of a closing of books, as though the
relevant taxable period had ended on the Closing Date (provided that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily
basis). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any deductions attributable to
Transaction Expenses that have not been reflected on a Seller Tax Return
shall, insofar as permissible, be allocated to the taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount for which Seller is obligated to indemnify
pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ exceed the Purchase Price.

  

  

SECTION 5.7 _Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_.

  

  

(a) If a Tax claim, audit, examination, notice of deficiency or other
adjustment, assessment or redetermination shall be made or threatened against
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or any of their Affiliates by any Taxing
Authority, which, if successful, would result in an indemnity payment pursuant
to _Section 5.6(a)_ or _(b)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim stating
the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent
known by the Indemnified Party. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the
Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period of time to allow the
Indemnifying Party to effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise the Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in
each case taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect to such
Tax Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
or any of their Affiliates to the extent that the Indemnified Party's ability
to effectively contest such Tax Claim is prejudiced as a result thereof.

  

  

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Tax for which Seller would
be solely responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ , Seller shall control at
its expense all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel), but shall not, without the prior written approval of
Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim arising in such
proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax Liability, to the extent
that any such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement may increase (i)
the Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any Sold
Company) or (ii) the Tax Liability of any Sold Company or with respect to any
Purchased Asset with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for
which Buyer would be responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_.

  

 

52  

  

(c) With respect to any Tax Claim for which Buyer would be solely responsible
pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ , Buyer shall have the right to control at its
expense all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel), but shall not, without the prior written approval of
Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim arising in such
proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax Liability, to the extent
that any such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement may increase (i)
the Tax Liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Sold
Company) or (ii) the Tax Liability of any Sold Company or with respect to any
Purchased Asset with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for
which Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_.

  

  

(d) With regard to a Tax Claim that is (i) related to any Purchased Asset or
in regard to any Sold Company, in each case with regard to a Straddle Period,
and (ii) would be described in _Section 5.6(a)_ or _Section 5.6(b)_ , but for
not being the sole responsibility of either Seller or Buyer, Seller and Buyer
shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection
with any such Tax Claim, and shall bear their own respective costs and
expenses; provided, however, neither Seller nor Buyer shall agree or consent
to compromise or settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any issue or claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree
or consent to any Tax Liability, without the prior written consent of the
other party.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied in this
Agreement, after the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer
(including, after the Closing, the Sold Companies) shall, without the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), file or cause to be filed (i) any amended Tax Return,
(ii) any claim for Tax refund or (iii) any Tax election, with respect to the
Sold Companies (or relating to its income, properties or operations), if any
such filing could have the effect of (i) increasing the Tax Liability of
Seller or their respective Affiliates (other than any Sold Company) (or, in
each case, otherwise materially disadvantaging such party) or (ii) increasing
the Tax Liability of any Sold Company or with respect to any Purchased Asset
with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for which Seller would
be responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_.

  

  

(f) Buyer and Seller will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the resolution of any Tax
Claims for which Buyer or Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section
5.6_ (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or
information). The party requesting such cooperation will pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the other party.

  

  

SECTION 5.8 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_.

  

  

(a) Any Tax refund that is received by Buyer, or, after the Closing, the Sold
Companies, from a Government Authority and any amounts credited against Tax to
which Buyer or the Sold Companies become entitled, that (i) relate to a Tax
for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ , and (ii) in the
case of a credit, results in a Tax Benefit to Buyer or the Sold Companies for
the Tax period during which such credit is first available, shall be for the
account of Seller and Buyer shall promptly pay over to Seller (to one or more
accounts designated by Seller) the amount of any such refund or any such
credit within five (5) days after the receipt or entitlement thereto. If such
refund is required to be returned to, or such credit is withdrawn by, a
Governmental Authority, Seller shall remit to Buyer such amount within five
(5) days of the date Buyer returns such refund amount to, or makes payment in
regard to a withdrawn credit by, the Governmental Authority. Buyer agrees
that, other than as required by Law, it shall not, without Seller's prior
written consent, cause or permit the Sold Companies to carry back to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss,
loss from operations or other Tax attribute, and further agrees that in such
cases, Seller shall have no obligation under this Agreement to return or remit
any refund or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by Buyer of the
foregoing undertaking.

  

  

(b) At the request of Seller, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed an amended
Tax Return or claim for Tax refund with respect to Taxes of the Sold Companies
for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and except in the
case of a detriment to Buyer, or for any portion of a Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date. Seller shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
Buyer with respect to any request pursuant to the previous sentence.

  

 

53  

  

SECTION 5.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  

  

(a) _Business Employees_. Buyer shall (or shall cause the Sold Companies to)
(i) continue the employment on the Closing Date of each Business Employee who
is employed by a Sold Company as of the Closing and (ii) where an offer of
employment is necessary for Buyer (or a Sold Company) to employ any other
Business Employee, within twenty-five (25) days prior to the Closing Date,
make an offer of employment to each other Business Employee, in both cases on
the terms set forth in this _Section 5.9_. Notwithstanding the generality of
the preceding sentence, to the extent any Business Employee who is an Employee
of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) has entered
into a written agreement or contractual undertaking with Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller which governs the compensation terms of such Business
Employee's employment (an " _Employment Agreement_ "), or is the subject of
any agreement of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Sold
Companies) regarding the terms and conditions of employment of such Business
Employee (collectively with any Employment Agreements " _Compensation
Agreements_ "), Seller and Buyer shall take all actions necessary to assign,
or cause the applicable Affiliate of Seller to assign, such Compensation
Agreements and all such obligations under any Compensation Agreements to one
of the Sold Companies or an Affiliate of Buyer effective as of the Closing
Date, and Buyer and its Affiliates expressly assume and agree to perform under
the Compensation Agreements in substantially the same manner and to the same
extent that the Seller and its applicable Affiliates would be required to
perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Buyer or
its Affiliates from amending any such Compensation Agreements, provided that
the Business Employees party thereto agree to such amendments. Buyer shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller
from any Liabilities incurred or arising as a result of such Compensation
Agreements following the Closing. Further, Buyer shall, or cause its
applicable Affiliates to, indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless against
any Liabilities or costs (including severance costs) arising from or connected
to the employment or termination of a Transferred Employee by Buyer or one of
its Affiliates after Closing. Unless a written acceptance of an offer of
employment is required by applicable Law, a Business Employee who continues
employment or who has received an offer of employment shall be deemed to have
accepted such continuance or offer, unless such Business Employee specifically
declines the continuance or offer. Business Employees described in this
_Section 5.9(a)_ who, by operation of Law or as set out in this _Section
5.9(a)_, or by acceptance of an offer of employment by Buyer or one if its
Affiliates, become employees of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including, as
of the Closing, any of the Sold Companies), shall collectively be the "
_Transferred Employees_ ". Transferred Employees who are based primarily
within the United States shall collectively be the " _Transferred US
Employees_ ", and all other Transferred Employees shall collectively be the "
_International Transferred Employees_ ".

  

  

(b) _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits_. For Transferred Employees
whose terms and conditions of employment are not governed by a collective
bargaining agreement, subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.9_ ,
during the Relevant Period or for so long as such Transferred Employee remains
employed, if shorter, Buyer shall provide (or cause one of its Affiliates to
provide) each Transferred Employee with (A) an annual base salary or wage
rate, (B) short term bonus, incentive compensation opportunities or commission
opportunities and (C) other compensation in the aggregate that are each at
least equal to his or her annual base salary or wage rates, or short term
bonus, incentive compensation, commission opportunities and other compensation
in the aggregate, in effect immediately prior to the Closing. In addition,
Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall provide to Transferred Employees (or
cause one of its Affiliates to provide) during the Relevant Period or for so
long as such Transferred Employee remains employed, if shorter, benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Following the Closing,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall provide the Transferred
Employees with any "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA) benefits (except, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
Multiemployer Plan), any equity or equity-based compensation plan or
arrangement, or any post-employment or post-retirement health or welfare plan
or arrangement (except as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986 or similar state law). With respect to any
individual Transferred Employee who affirmatively enters into an agreement
with Buyer or one of its Affiliates governing the compensation and benefits
applicable to such individual Transferred Employee, Buyer or one of its
Affiliates shall maintain the compensation and each benefit arrangement for
the individual Transferred Employee in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, unless further modified by the mutual agreement of Buyer
or one of its Affiliates and the individual Transferred Employee. Where
required by local Law, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall either obtain (or
cause the appropriate Sold Company to obtain) the consent of the relevant
Transferred Employee before making any changes to the terms and conditions of
the Transferred Employee's employment (including compensation and benefits)
following Closing or otherwise make the change in accordance with local Law.
For Transferred U.S. Employees whose terms and conditions of employment were
governed by a collective bargaining agreement to which a Sold Company was
party immediately prior to Closing, the collective bargaining agreements will
remain in place pursuant to its terms and continue to govern the terms and
conditions of employment applicable to those employees. For Transferred U.S.
Employees whose terms and conditions of employment were governed by a
collective bargaining agreement to which no Sold Company was a party
immediately prior to Closing, Buyer will cause one of its Affiliates to
recognize and bargain with the relevant union regarding terms and conditions
of employment for those employees consistent with applicable labor Law.

  

 

54  

  

(c) _U.S. Defined Contribution Plans_. Buyer shall take any and all necessary
actions to permit the Transferred Employees that are entitled to receive an
"eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4)) from
any Seller Plan that is a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan to roll
over such eligible rollover distribution, as part of any lump sum cash
distribution into an account under a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan
maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (the " _Buyer DC Plan_ "),
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of such plan and applicable
Law, effective no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
Closing Date (or such later time as mutually agreed by the Parties). Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate as reasonably necessary in order to facilitate and
effect an eligible rollover distribution for those Business Employees who
elect to rollover their account balances directly to the Buyer DC Plan. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer DC Plan shall not accept rollovers of any
employer securities (including any securities of Parent) from any Seller Plan.

  

  

(d) _Service Credit_. For all purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual and level of benefits under all employee benefit plans (other than a
benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) of Buyer or its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Transferred Employee after the Closing
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall receive full credit for
such Transferred Employee's years of service with Seller and its Affiliates
before the Closing (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which Seller and its Affiliates have given credit for prior
service), to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, prior
to the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable
Seller Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits ). Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and exchange such information
as is necessary to avoid any such duplication of benefits and to facilitate
Buyer's compliance with this _Section 5.9_. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent accrued for by the Company as a Current Liability and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall credit each
Transferred Employee with all paid time off accrued and unused by such
Transferred Employee through the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) _Eligibility_. Where applicable, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) at the Closing or the end of the term of the Transition
Services Agreement (the " _TSA Period_ "), as applicable, each Transferred
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under a
similar or comparable Seller Plan in which the Transferred Employee
participated immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), (ii) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements
of each New Plan to be waived or satisfied for such Transferred Employee and
his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the
analogous Old Plan as of the Closing and (iii) Buyer shall, or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cause all eligible
expenses incurred by each Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Transferred Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan, but only to the extent that, upon Buyer's written request, Seller's
or its Affiliates' insurance carriers, providers or third-party administrators
provide the applicable data related to such deductibles, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements to Buyer or its Affiliates.

  

  

(f) _Participation; Allocation of Liabilities_. Prior to the Closing, or at
the end of the TSA Period, as applicable, the Sold Companies shall discontinue
participation in and/or sponsorship of all Seller Plans. As of the Closing or
the end of the TSA Period, as applicable, each Transferred Employee shall
cease participation in all Seller Plans that provide for medical, health,
welfare or insurance benefits (each, a " _Seller Welfare Plan_ ") and commence
participation in corresponding New Plans maintained, administered or
contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliates, subject to and in accordance with
_Section 5.9(b)_ hereof. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for Transferred Employees and
their beneficiaries and dependents through the Closing. All claims incurred
under a Seller Welfare Plan for Transferred Employees after the Closing shall
be the responsibility of Buyer or its Affiliates. For purposes of this
_Section 5.9(f)_ , the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as
follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the death or accident giving rise to such
benefits; and (ii) health or medical, dental, vision care or prescription drug
benefits, upon provision of such services, materials or supplies. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be responsible for short- and long-term
disability benefits that, by their terms, are payable prior to the Closing,
and Buyer shall be responsible for such benefits that, by their terms, are
payable on or after the Closing.

  

  

(g) _Severance_. Any Transferred Employee who (i) is terminated other than for
cause attributable to such Transferred Employee (as reasonably determined by
Buyer or its Affiliates in their discretion) during the Relevant Period, or
(ii) rejects an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its Affiliates at
Closing (which offer of employment did not satisfy the requirements of
_Section 5.9(b)_ ) and does not otherwise accept another offer of employment
from Buyer or one of its Affiliates at Closing, shall be entitled to severance
payments and benefits from Buyer no less favorable than those that would have
been provided to such Transferred Employee under (A) Seller's or an
Affiliate's severance policy or individual employment, severance or separation
agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date
(each, a " _Seller Severance Plan_ "), as calculated using the same salary or
hourly wage rate or other compensation, as applicable, provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, except as Buyer
and its Affiliates, as applicable, and such Transferred Employee may otherwise
agree in writing and (B) any statutory, regulatory or common law scheme, in
each case applicable to such Transferred Employee (taking into account any
post-Closing service with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries), assuming for
purposes of this _Section 5.9(g)_ that such Transferred Employee had satisfied
any requirements for the receipt of severance under such plan or policy or
statutory or regulatory scheme, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Transferred Employee who rejects an offer of employment from Buyer or one of
its Affiliates at Closing (which offer of employment satisfied the material
requirements of _Section 5.9(b)_ ) and does not otherwise accept another offer
of employment from Buyer or one of its Affiliates at Closing shall be entitled
to severance payments and benefits (if any) solely from Seller or its
Affiliate (other than the Sold Companies).

  

 

55  

  

(h) _Workers ' Compensation_. In those jurisdictions where there is a workers'
compensation program, Buyer's or one of its Affiliates' workers' compensation
program shall be responsible for all claims, including expenses within any
applicable deductibles, for benefits that are deemed to be an injury or
disease occurring after the Closing by participating Transferred Employees.
Seller's workers' compensation program shall be responsible for all claims,
including expenses within any applicable deductibles, for benefits that are
deemed to be an injury or disease occurring on or prior to the Closing by
participating Transferred Employees.

  

  

(i) _Vacation_. With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which
any Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or
individual agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (the " _Vacation Policy_ "),
Buyer shall, or shall cause any of its Affiliates to, (i) allow such
Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation to the extent such amounts
are included as Current Liabilities and (ii) if any Transferred Employee's
employment terminates during the Relevant Period, pay the Transferred
Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the unused accrued vacation
time to the same extent that the Transferred Employee would have received a
cash payment therefor under the Vacation Policy or the applicable Seller
Severance Plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(j) _Outstanding Equity Awards_. Prior to the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates shall recognize the pro rata vesting of each outstanding equity
award held by Business Employees pursuant to the terms of the applicable
equity incentive plan and each individual equity or equity-based award
agreement granted thereunder. As of the Closing, the Sold Companies and their
Affiliates shall have no liability with respect to any outstanding equity or
equity-based compensation awards held by the Transferred Employees. Seller
shall be entitled to the value of any Tax deduction attributable to the
actions set forth in _Section 5.9(j)_.

  

  

(k) _Employee Communications_. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in communications with Business Employees with respect to employee
compensation and benefit plans maintained by Seller or Buyer and with respect
to other matters arising in connection with the Transactions and the Closing
Agreements.

  

  

(l) _Acknowledgement_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that nothing
contained in this _Section 5.9_ shall be construed to limit in any way the
ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employee from and after the Closing; _provided_ that such
termination is in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of any
applicable Compensation Agreement.

  

  

(m) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 10.13_, nothing in this _Section 5.9_ , express or implied, is
intended to confer any third party beneficiary or other rights, benefits, or
remedies under this Agreement upon any Person (including any Transferred
Employees or other current or former Business Employees), including any right
to employment or continued employment for any specified period or continued
participation in any Seller Plan or employee benefit plan sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliates, of any nature or
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.9_. No provision of this
_Section 5.9_ is intended to and such provisions do not modify, amend or
create any employee compensation or benefit plan of Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

  

  

(n) _Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and Seller recognize it to be in the best
interests of the parties hereto and their respective employees that the
transactions in this _Section 5.9_ be effected in an orderly manner and agree
to devote their respective reasonable best efforts and to cooperate fully in
complying with the provisions of this _Section 5.9_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to execute, deliver
and file all documents and to take all such actions as are deemed necessary or
desirable in order to carry out and perform the purpose of this _Section 5.9_
and to facilitate the transactions referred to in this _Section 5.9_.

  

 

56  

  

SECTION 5.10 _Labor Matters_.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any required
notification to, or any required consultation with, the employees, employee
representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and relevant government
agencies concerning the Transactions with respect to the Business Employees.

  

  

(b) Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from any and all Losses incurred by Seller or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the WARN Act arising (i) as a result of the
Transactions, or (ii) as a result of any employment losses affecting any
Business Employees that are ordered by Buyer in the ninety (90) day period
immediately following the Closing Date; _provided, however_ that no such
indemnification shall be required in the event that Seller or its Affiliates
fail to satisfy their obligations under the WARN Act in the event of (i) above
or their obligations under this _Section 5.10(b)_. Seller shall be responsible
for all WARN Act Liabilities relating to the periods prior to the Closing Date
with respect to any employment losses which are unrelated to the Transactions.
As of the Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall provide Buyer with
accurate information regarding the headcounts, locations and reason for
termination of any Employees terminated in the ninety (90) day period
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to the Sold Companies.

  

  

SECTION 5.11 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its Representatives shall not contact or
communicate with the employees, customers and suppliers of the Sold Companies
in connection with, or relating in any way to, the Transactions, without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

SECTION 5.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

  

  

(a) _Restrictions on Competing Activities Following Closing_.

  

  

(i) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, each of
Parent and Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries not to directly or indirectly sell in any geographic areas or
industry markets in which the Business has operated or sold products and
services prior to Closing (the " _Prior Areas_ ") any products or services
that are the same or substantially similar to any products or services of the
Business immediately prior to Closing (such products or services, "
_Competitive Products_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates will not, for a
period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, bid on the Contracts set
forth _Schedule 5.12(a)(i)_ , whether or not it would constitute a Competitive
Product in competition with Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall not prohibit
each of Parent and/or Seller, directly or indirectly (through an Affiliate or
otherwise), from: (A) designing, developing, manufacturing, using or
marketing, offering for sale or selling any Non-Competitive Products, (B)
investing in or holding securities of any Person engaged in a business
competitive to the Business to the extent such investment or holding does not,
directly or indirectly, confer on Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
more than 5% of the voting power, outstanding capital stock or other ownership
interests of such Person and (C) hereafter acquiring or investing in or, after
such acquisition or investment, continuing to own and operate, any entity or
business which (1) has operations that compete with the Business if such
operations account for less than the greater of (y) 20% of such entity's
consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to such
acquisition or investment and each subsequent fiscal year when Parent or
Seller continues to operate such entity or business ( _provided_ that this
_Section 5.12(a)(ii)(y)_ shall not be deemed to be violated if such operations
account for more than 20% of such entity's consolidated revenues if within
twelve (12) months following (I) the consummation of such acquisition or (II)
the first date in any subsequent fiscal year that such operations account for
more than 20% of such entity's consolidated revenues in its quarterly or
annual financial statements, as the case may be, Seller's or any of its
Affiliates' activities that compete with the Business account for less than
20% percent of such entity's consolidated annual revenues for the then most
recently completed fiscal year) and (z) $150,000,000 in consolidated revenues
for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the date of such acquisition or
investment and each subsequent fiscal year when Parent or Seller continues to
operate such entity or business or (2) is set forth on _Schedule 5.12(a)(ii)_.
In the event that Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall
sell to a Person any portion of their respective businesses (whether by means
of acquisition, asset purchase, merger, consolidation, similar business
combination or otherwise), the restrictions contained in this _Section
5.12(a)(ii)_ shall not prohibit such sale and shall not apply to any such
acquiring Person or such Person's Affiliates after the consummation of such
sale, _provided_ that each of Parent and Seller shall continue to be bound by
this _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ following such sale.

  

 

57  

  

(iii) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, each of
Parent and Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries (including through its and their respective officers, directors
and employees) not to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

(A) request, induce or attempt to influence any of the Business Employees to
terminate his or her employment with or service to Buyer or any Sold Company
or their Affiliates;

  

  

(B) attempt to dissuade any Business Employee from continuing employment with
Buyer or the Sold Companies or their Affiliates, as the case may be; or

  

  

(C) hire or employ or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to any Business Employee who is then employed by Buyer or the
Sold Companies or their Affiliates, or any Person who is covered by the
immediately following sentence. The restrictions of clause (C) of this
_Section 5.12(a)(iii)_ shall cease to apply to a Business Employee six (6)
months after the date of termination of his or her employment with Buyer, any
Sold Companies or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in clause (C) of this
_Section 5.12(a)(iii)_ shall restrict or preclude Parent, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates from making generalized searches for employees by
the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging
search firms that are not targeted at any such Business Employees so long as,
subject to the fall away provision in this _Section 5.12(a)(iii)(C)_ with
respect to the terminated Business Employees, none of Parent, Seller or any of
their Affiliates hire or employ any Business Employees during the two (2) year
period from and after the Closing Date.

  

  

(iv) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees that it will not, and will cause the Sold Companies and each of Buyer's
and the Sold Companies' respective Subsidiaries (including through its and
their respective officers, directors and employees) not to, directly or
indirectly:

  

  

(A) request, induce or attempt to influence to terminate his or her employment
with or service to Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, any employee
of Seller or its Affiliates that Buyer communicated with, became aware of or
was introduced to in connection with the Transactions or who is first
identified by employees of the Sold Companies or the Purchased Assets;

  

  

(B) attempt to dissuade from continuing employment with Seller or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, any employee of Seller or its Affiliates that
Buyer communicated with, became aware of or was introduced to in connection
with the Transactions or who is first identified by employees of the Sold
Companies or the Purchased Assets; or

  

  

(C) hire or employ or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, any employee of Seller or its Affiliates that Buyer
communicated with, became aware of or was introduced to in connection with the
Transactions or who is first identified by employees of the Sold Companies or
the Purchased Assets. The restrictions of clause (C) of this _Section
5.12(a)(iv)_ shall cease to apply to an employee of Seller or its Affiliates
six (6) months after the date of termination of his or her employment with
Seller and its Affiliates. Nothing in clause (C) of this _Section 5.12(a)(iv)_
shall restrict or preclude Buyer, any of the Sold Companies or any of Buyer's
or the Sold Companies' respective Affiliates from making generalized searches
for employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade
media) or by engaging search firms that are not targeted at any such employee
of Seller or its Affiliates.

  

  

(v) The parties mutually agree that this _Section 5.12(a)_ is reasonable in
scope and duration in light of the nature, size and location of the Business
and necessary to protect and preserve Buyer's, Parent's and Seller's
legitimate business interests and the value of the Business (including its
goodwill), the Sold Interests and Parent's and Seller's other businesses, and
to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on any party and their respective
successors. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of
this _Section 5.12(a)_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable Law.

  

 

58  

  

(b) If a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any term
or provision contained in this _Section 5.12_ is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal will have the
power (but without affecting the right of Parent, Seller or Buyer to obtain
the relief provided for in this _Section 5.12_ in any jurisdiction other than
such court's or tribunal's jurisdiction) to reduce the scope, duration or
geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. To the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable Law, each of Buyer, on the one hand,
and Parent and Seller, on the other hand, hereby waives on its own behalf and
on behalf of its successors, any provision of Law which renders any provision
of this _Section 5.12_ invalid, void or unenforceable in any respect.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy of
indemnity payments and the other remedies at law for any breach of the
requirements of this _Section 5.12_ would be inadequate, and agrees and
consents that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be
available, temporary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may
be granted without proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy and
without the posting of a bond, in any proceeding which may be brought to
enforce any of the provisions of this _Section 5.12_.

  

  

SECTION 5.13 _Release of Guaranties_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent,
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to, effective as of the Closing Date, terminate or cause to be
terminated, in each case without Liability on the part of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) (collectively, the " _Seller
Guarantors_ "), or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted for
such Seller Guarantors in respect of all Liabilities of the Seller Guarantors
under guarantees of or relating primarily to Liabilities (including under any
Contract or letter of credit or relating to any Leased Real Property) of the
Business and the Sold Companies to the extent listed on _Schedule 5.13_ (the "
_Guaranties_ "). In the event the foregoing actions are not completed by the
Closing Date, then Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Guarantors from and against all Losses incurred by any such Person as a result
of such failure and from and against any continuing Liabilities under any such
Guaranties, except for losses arising from any acts or omissions of a Seller
Guarantor. Seller and Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to terminate as provided above, or cause
Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the
Seller Guarantors in respect of, all obligations of the Seller Guarantors
under any such Guaranties, and Buyer shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Guarantors for any Losses arising after the Closing from such
Guaranties and (ii) not and shall not permit the Business, the Sold Companies,
the Company or their Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of or (B)
increase its obligations under, or transfer to another third party, any loan,
lease, Contract or other obligation for which any Seller Guarantor is liable
under such Guaranty unless Buyer, the Sold Companies or their respective
Affiliates are substituted in all respects for the Seller Guarantors, and the
Seller Guarantors are released in respect of all obligations of the Seller
Guarantors, under such Guaranties. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor has
performance obligations under any such Guaranty, Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to (x) perform, or cause its Affiliates to perform, such
obligations on behalf of such Seller Guarantor or (y) otherwise take such
action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such Seller Guarantor in
the same position as if Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and not such Seller
Guarantor, had performed or were performing such obligations. Buyer shall not
be obligated to pay any consent fee or similar payment to fulfill the
obligations of Buyer under this _Section 5.13_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and Seller shall, effective as of the Closing Date, terminate or
cause to be terminated, in each case without Liability on the part of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Sold Companies), the Indebtedness of the
Sold Companies set forth on _Section 3.15(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

  

 

59  

  

SECTION 5.14 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.3_ , each of the
parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such
documents and other papers, as may be required or reasonably requested to
consummate or give effect to the Transactions, including the Pre-Closing
Transfers.

Subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies) in connection with the Pre-
Closing Transfers and, as a result, will be between two or more of Seller

and Receivables_ "), all such Intercompany Payables and Receivables shall be
paid and satisfied by the party that is the obligor prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that any such Intercompany Payables and Receivables to be
paid and satisfied prior to the Effective Time may, at Seller's option, in
lieu of such payment and satisfaction, be settled by way of deemed
contributions, in the case of payables, and/or deemed dividends, in the case
of receivables. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent possible and
permissible under applicable Law, net cash of the Sold Companies may be

which any Sold Company is a party, contains any right or obligation that
relates to any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Sold Companies) other than the Business, including any right of the
counterparty to set-off amounts owed to the Business or the Sold Companies
against amounts owed to such counterparty by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Sold Companies) with respect to any of their businesses other
than the Business, Parent, Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable best
efforts, including cooperating with the other party, to amend, modify or split
such Contract such that the rights or obligations of such Contract to which
such Sold Company is a party relate only to the Business or otherwise
terminate or eliminate any such obligations prior to the Closing, or if not
completed prior to Closing, as promptly as practicable thereafter. Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Sold
Companies) from and against all Losses arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any such Contract to which any Sold Company is a party to the
extent such Losses arise out of, relate to or result from any business of

SECTION 5.18 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Sold
Companies to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, all past and present directors
and officers of the Sold Companies (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") against any Liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
such DandO Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of any of the Sold
Companies or is or was serving at the request of any of the Sold Companies as
a director or officer of any other corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other business or non-profit enterprise
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing (including with

Sold Companies pursuant to the Sold Companies' certificates of incorporation,
bylaws, other comparable organizational documents and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof and (ii) without

cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Parent and Seller use reasonable best
efforts to design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements and, to
the extent available, use such alternative disclosure arrangements to provide
information, documents and access to Buyer and its Representatives in a manner
that would not violate applicable Law, violate the confidentiality obligations

thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall and
shall cause the Sold Companies to reasonably cooperate with Seller, its
Affiliates and their counsel in connection with the prosecution, contest or
defenses of any Proceedings, including making available its personnel and

(a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions; and

  

  

(b) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in contained this
Agreement of such party of which it obtains knowledge that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ (in the case of Buyer) or _Section 7.1_
(in the case of Parent and Seller) not to be satisfied;

  

  

 _provided_ that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such

Representation prior to the Closing Date in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, and following the Closing, with the Sold Companies, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-
client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be
retained by Seller; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement
of retention shall not extend to any communication not involving this
Agreement or the Closing Agreements, the Transactions, or to communications
with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisers or to any
privilege otherwise held by Buyer irrespective of the Transactions or the
Closing Agreements.

  

  

(c) Buyer agrees to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates to take,
all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this _Section 5.23_.

impose any new or additional conditions or contingencies, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or
prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of any portion of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the
Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against any other party to any Debt Document, the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall not release or consent to the
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may modify, restate, supplement, amend or
amend and restate the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, co-agents, other agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or to
increase the amount of funds available thereunder. Buyer shall promptly
deliver copies of any amendment, restatements, supplementation, modification
or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter to Seller. Buyer will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become due. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex" provisions set forth in
the Fee Letter) and such portion is required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, or if Buyer
reasonably determines that such funds may become unavailable to Buyer on the
terms and conditions set forth therein, Buyer shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event: (i) notify Seller in
writing thereof; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain an amount equal to
such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative debt financing sources on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Buyer (or its
Affiliates), taken as a whole, than as contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (taking into account the "market flex" provisions set forth in the Fee
Letter) in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable
portion thereof, as the case may be; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such alternative
financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to Seller true and
complete copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic
terms, and the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" provisions (but
not covenants), may be redacted, none of which redacted provisions would
adversely affect the conditionality or aggregate principal amount of the
Financing) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
alternative financing.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after obtaining
knowledge thereof, give Seller written notice of any: (i) breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to result in breach or default) related to
the Financing by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Buyer becomes
aware; (ii) if and when Buyer becomes aware that any portion of the Financing
contemplated by any Commitment Letters may not be available for the financing
purposes; (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment
Letter or other Debt Document or (2) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to any Commitment Letter or other Debt Document (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or Debt Documents); (iv) of any
expiration or termination of any Commitment Letter or other Debt Document; or
(v) any change, circumstance or event which causes Buyer to believe in good
faith that it shall not be able to timely obtain all or any material portion
of the Financing in the amounts or from the sources contemplated by the
Commitment Letters (and that Buyer will not be able to obtain acceptable
alternate financing). Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current
basis upon request by Seller of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, including providing copies
of all definitive agreements related to the Financing to the extent requested
by Seller.

  

  

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, the definitions of "Debt Commitment
Letter," "Debt Financing" and "Financing" include the Debt Commitment Letter
and any document related thereto as the same may be amended, waived, modified
or replaced pursuant to this _Section 5.28_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and each of Parent and Seller shall cause the Sold
Companies to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide, to the
extent within their applicable control, Buyer, such customary cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer, at Buyer's sole expense, in connection with the
Debt Financing (provided, however, that such requests shall not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Parent, Seller and the Sold
Companies), including using commercially reasonable efforts with respect to
the following: (i) furnishing Buyer with such financial information set forth
in items 3 and 4 of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Required

preparation of customary rating agency presentations, bank information

statements reflecting Buyer as the obligor; and (B) executing and delivering
customary authorization letters relating to the Debt Financing; (iv) (A) to
assist in the preparation and negotiation of definitive financing
documentation and the schedules and exhibits thereto (including loan

estoppel letters, consents and similar items as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources, and establishing bank and other accounts
and blocked account agreements and lock-box arrangements to the extent
necessary in connection with the Debt Financing; and (B) to facilitate the
pledging of collateral, it being understood that such documents will not take
effect until the Closing and cooperating with customary field examinations and
collateral audits and appraisals; (v) obtaining the fully executed pay-off
letters and any related releases of Encumbrances, terminations and instruments
of discharge (including UCC termination statements); (vi) obtaining owner's
policies of title insurance for the Owned Real Property (at Buyer's sole cost
and expense), including delivery to the title company of customary title
affidavits, transfer documentation, certificates and other documentation
executed by Seller and/or the applicable Sold Company as is reasonably
necessary for the title company to issue the title insurance policies insuring
title in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided in no event
shall any such deliveries increase the obligations or liabilities of Seller or
any applicable Sold Company under this Agreement; and (vii) furnishing Buyer
promptly, and in any event no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, with all documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001, as amended, that has been reasonably requested by Buyer
in writing, at least nine (9) calendar days prior to the Closing Date. Subject
to Buyer's indemnification obligations under this _Section 5.29_ , each of
Parent and Seller hereby consents to the use of the Business's and Sold
Companies' logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, however,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is neither intended, nor
reasonably likely, to harm or disparage Parent or Seller or the reputation or
goodwill of Parent or Seller and their marks.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall: (i) promptly reimburse Parent, Seller and any of their
Affiliates and Representatives for all of the documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Parent, Seller and any of
their Affiliates and Representatives in connection with this _Section 5.29_ ;

misuse of the logos or marks of Parent or Seller.

  

 

67  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including this
_Section 5.29_ ), none of Parent, Seller or their Affiliates or
Representatives shall: (i) be required to pay any commitment or other fee or
reimburse any expenses in connection with the Financing; (ii) be required to
incur any Liability for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is
not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Buyer or give any indemnity in
connection with the Financing; (iii) be required to take any action that would

may be effective at or after the Closing; (iv) be required to take any action
in connection with the Financing that would unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing business or operation of Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives; provided, that Parent, Seller or any Affiliate or

Financing Sources promptly upon obtaining knowledge that any such cooperation
is being withheld and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such interference in order to permit the provision of such cooperation; (v)

with respect to the matters relating to the Financing or cause any director,

personal liability in connection with the Financing; (vi) provide in
connection with the Debt Financing any information the disclosure of which is
prohibited or restricted under Law or is legally privileged; provided, that

capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any pro forma financial information, (2) any description of all or any
component of the Debt Financing, including any such description to be included

financial statements or any other information of the type required by Rule
3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (5) Compensation Disclosure

their Affiliates or Representatives shall be required to incur or have any
Losses with respect to the Financing or any marketing materials, presentations
or disclosure documents in connection therewith.

  

  

SECTION 5.30 _Lease Transfers_. Prior to Closing, each of Parent and Seller
will use commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause its Affiliates to,
transfer and assign to the Sold Companies the leases of real property set
forth in _Schedule 5.30_. Within 10 calendar days of the date hereof, Seller
shall notify Buyer if Seller determines that any of the leases set forth on
_Schedule 5.30_ cannot be transferred or assigned to a Sold Company without
the consent of a third party.

  

  

SECTION 5.31 _Insurance Matters._ SECTION 5.32

  

  

(a) Prior to the date hereof, Parent has maintained insurance policies for
benefit of itself, and its Affiliates covering certain liabilities relating to
claims arising out of occurrences or acts occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date (the " _Insurance Coverage_ "). For a period of one year following the
Closing Date, Parent agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably
necessary to maintain Insurance Coverage after the Closing Date for the
benefit of Buyer and not to voluntarily relinquish or terminate policies
providing Insurance Coverage if doing so would adversely affect the
availability of such Insurance Coverage. The availability of Insurance
Coverage with respect to any Insurance Coverage Claim shall be subject in all
respects to Parent's applicable deductibles, retention and similar limits. To
the extent that any claim arising out of any act, omission, occurrence, fact
or circumstance existing or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date is made
against Buyer and the Insurance Coverage by its terms applies to such claim
(any such claim, an " _Insurance Coverage Claim_ "), upon Buyer's request,
Parent shall submit such Insurance Coverage Claim upon becoming aware thereof
to the insurer under the applicable insurance policy for potential payment and
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the maximum recovery from the
provider of the related Insurance Coverage. In addition, Parent agrees to
cooperate with Buyer to make the benefits of the Insurance Coverage available
to Buyer (subject to the terms and conditions of such Insurance Coverage) and
continue, from and after the Closing Date, to process such Insurance Coverage
Claims in the ordinary course of business in substantially the same manner as
similar claims were processed prior to the Closing Date. In the event that
Parent receives any proceeds of the Insurance Coverage with respect to any
Insurance Coverage Claims thereunder and such claim has been paid by Buyer,
Parent shall, or shall cause one if its Subsidiaries, to, promptly pay or
reimburse Buyer with respect to the amount so paid by Buyer in accordance with
this _Section 5.31_.

  

 

68  

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges that effective as of the Closing Date, Parent intends
to remove the Sold Companies, the assets of the Sold Companies and the
Purchased Assets from the Insurance Coverage to the extent that the Insurance
Coverage relates to any occurrences arising at any time after the Closing
Date. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that no Insurance Coverage shall be
available to Buyer with respect to any injury, loss or damage that Buyer or
any third party may suffer as a result of any act, omission, occurrence, fact
or circumstance occurring with respect to any period after the Closing Date,
and no assurance or representation is made or implied as to the availability
of Insurance Coverage with respect to matters existing on or before Closing.

  

  

SECTION 5.32 _UAE Arrangement._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that:

  

  

(a) Following the date of this Agreement, the Business or Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent (including the Sold Companies), on behalf of the
Business, is expected to submit a Government Bid with respect to the matter
set forth on _Schedule 5.32_ (the " _UAE Contract_ "), which may be awarded
prior to, on or after the Closing Date. If the UAE Contract is awarded to the
Business or Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (including any of the Sold
Companies), on behalf of the Business, Parent shall be entitled to, and Buyer
shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) pay to Parent an amount (" _UAE
Royalties_ ") equal to five percent (5%) of all gross revenues (calculated in
accordance with GAAP and consistent with current accounting practices) paid to
or on behalf of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (or accrued, to the extent that
Buyer or its Subsidiaries elect to defer payments thereunder) under the UAE
Contract with respect to each year within the initial five (5) year term of
the UAE Contract (the " _UAE Royalties Period_ "); _provided_ , that the
amount payable with respect to any period shall not exceed the Applicable Cap.
" _Applicable Cap_ " means, with respect to any period as to which payment
hereunder is required, the following percentage of EBIT under the UAE
Contract: thirty-three percent (33%) during the UAE Royalties Period. " _EBIT_
" means earnings before interest and taxes, calculated in accordance with GAAP
and consistent with current accounting practices.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall be reasonably consulted with respect to all material aspects
of any proposed Government Bid for the UAE Contract. Parent and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries (including, prior to Closing,
the Sold Companies) to, provide Buyer with reasonable access to all material
information regarding, and reasonable support in reviewing, any proposed
Government Bid for the UAE Contract. The parties agree that the officers of
the Sold Companies shall have primary responsibility for, and shall take the
lead in, scheduling and conducting any meeting or negotiation and defining the
material terms thereof with respect to the UAE Contract; _provided_ , _that_ ,
Parent agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries (including the Sold Companies)
to, consult with the Buyer reasonably in advance of taking any such action.
The parties agree that, to the extent reasonably practicable and legally
permissible, one of the Sold Companies shall be the Person that (i) submits
any Government Bid with respect to the UAE Contract, and (ii) executes the UAE
Contract on behalf of the Business (if the UAE Contract is awarded to the
Business or Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, on behalf of the Business). The
terms of the final submission of any Government Bid for the UAE Contract and,
if such Government Bid is successful, the terms of the definitive UAE
Contract, will be subject to the prior review and approval of Buyer, such
consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall pay the UAE Royalties to Parent on a quarterly basis, with (i)
the first payment thereof being due and payable within sixty (60) days
following the end of the first calendar quarter in which gross revenues
(calculated in accordance with GAAP and consistent with current accounting
practices) are received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (or accrued as
contemplated in _Section 5.32 (a)_ above) pursuant to the UAE Contract and
(ii) subsequent UAE Royalties payments being due and payable within sixty (60)
days following the end of each calendar quarter thereafter during which gross
revenues (calculated in accordance with GAAP and consistent with current
accounting practices) in respect of the UAE Royalties Period are received by
Buyer or its Subsidiaries (or accrued as contemplated in _Section 5.32(a)_
above).

  

 

69  

  

(d) If the aggregate UAE Royalties paid for any calendar year during the UAE
Royalties Period are greater than the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) of all
gross revenues (calculated in accordance with GAAP and consistent with current
accounting practices) paid to or on behalf of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (or
accrued, to the extent that Buyer or its Subsidiaries elect to defer payments
thereunder) under the UAE Contract with respect to such year, and (ii) the
Applicable Cap (such lesser amount, the "Correct Royalty"), then Parent or
Seller shall pay Buyer (to such account designated by Buyer) within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the later of (1) the date of the final payment with
respect to such calendar year during the UAE Royalties Period, and (2) the
date Buyer provides written notice of a required payment under this _Section
5.32(d)_ , by wire transfer of immediately available funds in dollars, free
and clear of any withholdings or other deductions, an amount in cash equal to
(w) the aggregate UAE Royalties paid for such calendar year minus (x) the
Correct Royalty (such amount, the "Excess Amount"); provided, that, if Buyer
would otherwise be entitled to an Excess Amount payment, then Buyer may, at
its option, satisfy such amount by setting off all or any portion of the
Excess Amount against payment of any UAE Royalties to Seller for the final
quarter of the applicable calendar year. If the aggregate UAE Royalties paid
for any calendar year during the UAE Royalties Period are less than the
Correct Royalty, then Buyer shall pay Seller (to such account designated by
Seller) within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of the final payment
with respect to such calendar year during the UAE Royalties Period, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in dollars, free and clear of any
withholdings or other deductions, an amount in cash equal to (y) the Correct
Royalty minus (z) the aggregate UAE Royalties paid for such calendar year.

  

  

(e) If requested by Parent at least 5 Business Days prior to the end of any
calendar quarter during the term of the UAE Royalties Period, Buyer shall
provide to Parent within thirty (30) days following the end of such calendar
quarter Buyer's good faith estimate of the UAE Royalties under the UAE
Contract with respect to such calendar quarter. Buyer shall and shall cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to permit Parent and its Representatives to
examine the books and records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries with respect to
the UAE Contract twice per calendar year during the UAE Royalties Period upon
at least thirty (30) day's advance written notice by Parent to permit Parent
to verify the calculation of UAE Royalties due hereunder; _provided_ , that no
examination shall be conducted outside of normal business hours or in a manner
that interferes unreasonably with Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' business.
Except to the extent required by Law or as otherwise expressly permitted by
Buyer in writing, each of Parent and Seller hereby agree that it will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, treat all information (written and oral)
concerning the UAE Contract, whether received on, prior to or after the date
of this Agreement and irrespective of the form of communication, as
confidential, including by (i) keeping such information strictly confidential
and not, without Buyer's prior written consent, disclosing any such
information in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part and (ii) not using
such information other than in connection with its rights under this _Section
5.32(e)_. The confidentiality obligations under this _Section 5.32(e)_ shall
survive until the second anniversary after the end of the UAE Royalties
Period.

  

  

(f) Following the Closing, in the event the UAE Contract is awarded to the
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (excluding any of the Sold Companies), on
behalf of the Business, (i) the parties will work together in good faith to
assign and transfer the UAE Contract to Buyer or its Subsidiaries and until
such assignment and transfer is effected Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer or its Subsidiaries the benefits
thereof, provided, that, in any event Parent shall provide Buyer with all
economic benefits under the UAE Contract, including by paying to Buyer all
amounts received by Parent or its Subsidiaries under the UAE Contract (in each
case, subject to this _Section 5.32_ ); (ii) Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed Parent's agent for purposes of completing, fulfilling, and
discharging Parent's liabilities thereunder; and (iii) Buyer agrees that to
the extent it receives the economic benefits under the UAE Contract it will
pay, perform and discharge and diligently perform all requirements, and
furnish all services and materials necessary to complete performance of the
obligations, of the UAE Contract in good faith and otherwise in material
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof and applicable Law, and,
except in cases of bad faith, intentional breach or gross negligence of Parent
or its Subsidiaries, indemnify Parent against and hold Parent harmless from,
all obligations and liabilities relating to the performance or failure to
perform under the UAE Contract. In addition, to govern the relationship of
Parent and Buyer in relation to the UAE Contract until it is assigned and
transferred to Buyer or its Subsidiaries, the parties shall enter into a
Subcontract under which, to the extent permissible under Law, the Buyer or its
Subsidiaries will perform for and in the place of the Parent any and all
operations and provide any and all goods, equipment, services and other
performance obligations under the UAE Contract, pursuant to its respective
terms and conditions, including any and all amendments, options,
modifications, purchase orders issued thereunder and such other terms and
conditions as may have been duly incorporated in the UAE Contract.

  

  

(g) Without in any way limiting the obligations of the parties under this
_Section 5.32_ , no party hereto shall be under any obligation to submit any
Government Bid with respect to the UAE Contract or make any other effort
whatsoever to secure the UAE Contract.

  

  

(h) Neither the UAE Contract nor any of the rights and obligations thereunder
may be assigned by (i) Buyer or its Subsidiaries to any Person unless, as a
condition to such assignment or transfer, provision shall be made and Buyer
shall require that the assignee or transferee shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.32_ and in any event, no such
assignment or transfer shall relieve Buyer and its Subsidiaries from their
obligations under this _Section 5.32_ , or (ii) Parent without the prior
written consent of Buyer. Other than with respect to assignments to
Affiliates, Parent may not assign its rights to the UAE Royalties payment
without the prior written consent of Buyer. Any attempted assignment or
transfer other than in compliance with the foregoing shall be null and void,
ab initio, and of no force or effect.

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such
Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

  

  

(iii) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to
August 15, 2018 (as such date may be extended in accordance with this _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ , the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall have
the right to extend the Termination Date to August 31, 2018 in the event that
Seller shall have delivered to Buyer, no later than August 7, 2018, the
unaudited quarterly financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2018
referred to in paragraph 3(c) of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

(iv) by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer, if there shall have been a
breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set
forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer or any of such representations
and warranties shall have become untrue, in any case with respect to such
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants, in a manner that would
result in any conditions set forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied, such
breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by Seller, and the breach or
inaccuracy, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30)
days following Seller's written notice of such breach or inaccuracy or is not
capable of being cured on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ shall
not be available to Parent or Seller if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

  

  

(v) by Buyer, upon written notice to Seller, if there shall have been a breach
of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth
in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Seller or any of such
representations and warranties shall have become untrue, in any case with
respect to such representations, warranties, agreements or covenants, in a
manner that would result in any conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not
being satisfied, such breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by Buyer, and
the breach or inaccuracy, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within
thirty (30) days following Buyer's written notice of such breach or inaccuracy
or is not capable of being cured on or prior to the Termination Date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(a)(v)_ shall not be available to Buyer if it is then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;
or

  

  

(vi) by Seller, if all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than any conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing)
have been satisfied or waived by Buyer, Seller has irrevocably given notice to
Buyer in writing that it is prepared to consummate the Closing, and Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing on the date the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.8_ , or, if later, within two (2) Business Days after
the delivery of such notice.

  

  

(b) In the event of termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to this _Section
8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other and the
Transactions shall be terminated, without further action by any party. If the
Transactions are terminated as provided herein, Buyer shall return all
documents and other material received from Seller relating to the
Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to
Seller.

  

 

73  

  

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Transactions are abandoned as described in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement
shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, without any
Liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective directors,
officers, employees, owners, Representatives or Affiliates, and the
Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by the parties hereto,
except for (i) the last sentence of _Section 5.2_ (Access) and (ii) each of
_Section 5.17_ (Expenses; Transfer Taxes), _Section 5.29(b)_ (Financing
Cooperation), _Section 8.1_ (Termination), this _Section 8.2_ (Effect of
Termination); _Section 8.3_ (Buyer Termination Payment) and _Article X_
(Miscellaneous), each of which, shall survive such termination. Subject to
_Section 8.3_ , nothing in this _Section 8.2_ , however, shall be deemed to
release any party from any Liability for any willful breach by such party of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to termination. For purposes
of this _Section 8.2_ , " _willful_ " shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.3 _Buyer Termination Payment._

  

  

(a) If (i) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_
or _Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ , or (ii) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ ( _provided_ , in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ , that at the time of such termination, Seller would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement under either _Section
8.1(a)(iv)_ or _Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ ), then within three (3) Business Days
following the date of termination in the case of a termination by Seller, and
concurrently with and as a condition to termination, in the case of a
termination by Buyer, Buyer will pay to Seller or the Company, as directed by
Seller, a fee equal to $27,000,000 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Seller.

  

  

(b) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Buyer Termination Fee,
if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ , shall not
constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent, Seller and the Sold Companies under the
circumstances for their efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In furtherance of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to _Section 10.17_ , upon payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with the terms hereof, Seller's
right to receive or direct the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee to the
extent provided in _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Seller, the Sold Companies and any of their respective Affiliates
against Buyer, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources, and each of their
respective former, current, or future directors, officers, employees, agents,
general and limited partners, managers, members, equityholders, Affiliates and
assignees, and each former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, equityholder, general or limited partner, manager, member,
equityholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Specified Parties_ ") for any Losses suffered as a result of the failure of
the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or for any alleged breach of the Commitment Letters, and no
Specified Party shall have any other liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, in each case, whether based on contract, tort
or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or
equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any Law or otherwise and whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of a party hereto to another Person or otherwise.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay any amounts due
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller
commences an action, suit or proceeding that results in a judgment against
Buyer for the amounts set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , Buyer shall pay to
Seller its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding together with interest on the
amounts due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

ARTICLE IX 
  
  INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

SECTION 9.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ (other than _Section 3.11_ related to Taxes, the survival of
which is provided in _Section 5.6(e)_ ) and _Article IV_ shall survive the
Closing and shall terminate one (1) year after the Closing Date. The covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement shall terminate on the Closing
Date, unless a specific covenant or agreement requires performance after the
Closing Date, in which case such covenant or agreement shall survive for a
period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the performance of such
covenant or agreement is required to be completed.

  

  

SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article IX_ , each of
Parent and Seller agrees to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Sold Companies) and their respective
successors, permitted assigns, equityholders, officers, directors, employees,
Representatives, members, partners and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against, without duplication, any Losses
incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Person arising out of, relating
to or resulting from (i) any breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by Parent and Seller in _Article III_ of this Agreement; (ii)
any breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Parent and Seller in this
Agreement; (iii) the Retained Liabilities (except those Liabilities described
in _Section 2.5(a)(vi)_ the indemnity of which is provided for in _Section
5.6_ ); and (iv) the Liabilities set forth on _Schedule 9.2(a)(iv)_.

  

  

(b) The obligation of Parent and Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for Losses with respect to the matters contained in _Section 9.2(a)_
other than _Sections 9.2(a)(ii) - (iv)_ is subject to the following
limitations: (i) neither Parent nor Seller shall be required to provide
indemnification to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ , unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or suffered by
Buyer Indemnified Persons from the matters contained in _Section 9.2(a)(i)_
exceeds one half of one percent (0.5%) of the Initial Purchase Price (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification for only the amount in excess of the Deductible; and (ii) in
no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which Parent and Seller are
obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ exceed one half of one percent (0.5%) of the Initial Purchase Price
(the " _Cap_ "). In addition to the foregoing limitations, in no event shall
Parent's and Seller's indemnification obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_
exceed, in the aggregate, the Final Purchase Price. For the avoidance of
doubt, except for the previous sentence, none of the limitations set forth in
this _Section 9.2(b)_ shall apply to claims for indemnification under _Section
5.6(a)_ or _Sections 9.2(a)(ii) - (iv)_ or claims arising out of or relating
to a breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations.

  

  

(c) If applicable, any Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled
to recover pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of
Seller Fundamental Representations shall be satisfied in the following order
of recovery: (i) first, directly from Parent and/or Seller, solely to the
extent, and in the amount of, the remaining retention (if any) under the
buyer-side representations and warranties insurance policy purchased by Buyer
in connection with this Agreement (the " _R andW Policy_"), subject to the other
limitations set forth in this _Section 9.2_ , (ii) second, from the RandW
Policy, solely to the extent that any such Losses are covered under the RandW
Policy (subject to the terms and conditions of the RandW Policy), and (iii)
third, directly from Parent and/or Seller, solely to the extent that (A) the
limit of liability under the RandW Policy has been fully exhausted or (B) any
such Losses are not otherwise covered under the RandW Policy, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this _Section 9.2._

  

  

SECTION 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article IX_ , Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the
Sold Companies) and their respective successors, permitted assigns,
equityholders, officers, directors, employees, Representatives, members,
partners and agents (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ " and,
together with the Buyer Indemnified Persons, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from
and against any Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person
arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by Buyer in _Article IV_ of this Agreement;
(ii) any breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Buyer in this
Agreement; (iii) any Assumed Liability; and (iv) the ownership, use or
possession of the Sold Companies and Sold Interests.

  

 

75  

  

(b) The obligation of Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for
Losses with respect to the matters contained in _Section 9.3(a)_ other than
Sections _9.3(a)(ii) - (iii)_ is subject to the following limitations: (i)
Buyer shall not be required to provide indemnification to any Seller
Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ , unless the aggregate
amount of Losses incurred or suffered by Seller Indemnified Persons from the
matters contained in _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible, and then
Seller Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for only the
amount in excess of the Deductible; and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate
amount of Losses for which Buyer is obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnified
Persons pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ exceed the Cap. In addition to the
foregoing limitations, in no event shall Buyer's indemnification obligations
under _Section 9.3(a)_ exceed, in the aggregate, the Final Purchase Price. For
the avoidance of doubt, except for the previous sentence, none of the
limitations set forth in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall apply to claims for
indemnification with respect to Buyer Fundamental Representations or under
_Section 9.3(a)(ii) - (iv)_.

  

  

SECTION 9.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or
warranty, covenant or agreement shall terminate on the applicable survival
termination date (as set forth in _Section 9.1_ ), unless an Indemnified Party
shall have incurred a Loss prior to such applicable survival termination date
and made an Indemnification Claim (as defined below) pursuant to _Section 9.2_
or _9.3_ , subject to the terms and conditions of _Article IX_ , prior to such
termination date, as applicable, including by delivering a Claims Notice (as
defined below) to the Indemnifying Party (as defined below). If an Indemnified
Party has made a proper Indemnification Claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ prior to such termination date, then such claim
for such Loss incurred (and only such claim for such Loss incurred), if then
unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set
forth in _Section 9.1_.

  

  

SECTION 9.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  

  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the Indemnified Party first becomes aware of any
event or other facts (including any Third Party Claim) that has resulted or
that might result in any Loss for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
any indemnification under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_ , subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ (such claim, an " _Indemnification
Claim_ "), and such Claim Notice shall contain (i) a reasonably detailed
description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Loss incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party together with such
supporting documents reasonably available to such Indemnified Party, (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Indemnification Claim to the
extent of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) a demand
for payment of such Loss; _provided_ , that failure to give such notification
shall not affect such Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder
and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this _Article IX_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the Indemnifying
Party shall respond within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt thereof
(the " _Claim Response ")._ Any Claim Response must specify whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes the Indemnification Claim described in the Claim
Notice and the basis of such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days following its receipt of
such Claim Notice that such Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ , such Indemnification Claim
specified in the Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a Loss of the
Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ and the amount specified in the
Claim Notice shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the
Indemnification Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later
date when the amount of such Indemnification Claim (or such portion thereof)
becomes finally determined.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect
to such claim through the delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith a resolution of such dispute and, if not timely
resolved through negotiations within 20 days after the conclusion of the
twenty (20) Business Day response period, such dispute shall be resolved in a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 10.14_. To the
maximum extent permitted by law, the decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be final and binding not be subject to appeal.

  

  

(d) Any amounts payable by Parent, Seller or Buyer to the Indemnified Party as
so finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days after such final determination.

  

 

76  

  

SECTION 9.6 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. If there occurs an
indemnifiable event which involves any claim or the commencement of any action
or proceeding by a third Person, including any Governmental Authority (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice of such Third Party Claim or the commencement
thereof. The failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only if, and to the extent
that, such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In
the event that an action is brought against an Indemnified Party and such
Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
thereof pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Indemnified Party) if (a) the Third Party Claim relates primarily to any
criminal Proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation, (b) the Third
Party Claim primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (c) the Losses relating to the Third Party Claim are
reasonably likely to exceed the maximum amount that the Indemnified Party
could then be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Party under the
applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (d) the Third Party Claim is one
in which the Indemnifying Party is also a party and, based upon the advice of
counsel, joint representation would be inappropriate or there may be legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of such election to assume the
defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party hereunder for any legal costs or expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, except as otherwise provided in this _Article IX_. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to cooperate fully with
each other and their respective counsel in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such action or asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as
contemplated hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) at its own expense in the defense of such
action or asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
an action, no settlement or compromise thereof may be effected (i) by the
Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (A)
the settlement seeks only monetary relief and all such relief provided is paid
or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party, (B) the settlement or
compromise provides for a full release by the party of the Indemnified Party
with respect to the claim(s) being settled and (C) the settlement or
compromise does not contain any admission of finding or wrongdoing on behalf
of the Indemnified Party or (ii) by the Indemnified Party without the consent
of the Indemnifying Party. Except as contemplated hereunder, in no event shall
an Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement or compromise effected
without its prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
(other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed
to give a Claim Notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, (1)
the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and
(2) the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the
defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making officers, directors,
employees and agents of the Indemnified Party available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide information, testimony at depositions, hearings or
trials, and such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

  

SECTION 9.7 _Tax Indemnity_. Indemnification with respect to Tax matters
(including breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.11_ of this Agreement or the covenants set forth in _Section 5.5_ of this
Agreement) shall be governed exclusively by _Section 5.5_ , _Section 5.6_,
_Section 5.7_ and _Section 5.8_.

  

  

SECTION 9.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree that
any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 9.9 _Additional Limitations_.

  

  

(a) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or any Closing
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

  

(b) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , nothing herein shall relieve an Indemnified Party from its
duty to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
may be indemnifiable hereunder. If an Indemnified Party receives a payment in
respect of Losses after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party
under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of such
Losses, the Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and
promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of such payment (less the
Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within five (5) Business
Days after receipt. An Indemnified Party's right to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ , as applicable, will be reduced by the
amount paid by a third party (including an insurance company or any third
party owing an indemnification or similar obligation to the Indemnified
Party), or paid by such third party to another for the account or benefit of
Parent, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, with respect to the settlement or
resolution of a claim for which Parent, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
was entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery from such third parties and
under all insurance policies (or similar obligations) available to it in good
faith and shall remit to the Indemnifying Party any such insurance or other
third party proceeds that are paid to the Indemnified Parties with respect to
Losses for which such Indemnified Parties have been previously compensated
pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

  

 

77  

  

(c) The amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Losses, in each case, net of costs of collection
resulting from making any claim thereunder and (ii) any Tax Benefits.

  

  

(d) With respect to indemnification claims made under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section 9.3(a)(i)_ , for purposes of determining breach and calculating the
amount of any Losses attributable to any such breach, inaccuracy or
noncompliance, except in the case of _Section 3.10(b)_ , all references to
"material," "materiality," "material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" and
similar qualifications shall be disregarded.

  

  

(e) In connection with the Retained Liability set forth in _Section
2.5(a)(xiii)_ , Buyer agrees (i) to reasonably cooperate with Parent, Seller
and any of their respective Subsidiaries and to take all other reasonable
actions, including to provide Parent, Seller and any of their respective
Subsidiaries with reasonable access to the Owned Real Property in Crestview,
FL (" _Crestview Property_ ") at the sole expense of Parent, Seller or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, following reasonable advance
notice from Parent, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, (ii) to make all reasonable omissions, including to not conduct
and to not solicit or importune any Governmental Authority to require any
excavation, investigation, sampling or testing of soil or groundwater at the
Crestview Property unless (A) upon Buyer's good faith reliance on advice of
legal counsel that is reasonably acceptable to Seller (Jones Day being deemed
to be legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Seller), required by
Environmental Law, including any Permit required under Environmental Law, (B)
required by any Order or demand of a Governmental Authority, or (C) reasonably
necessary to address a potential imminent or substantial threat to human
health or the environment, and (iii) that any environmental investigation,
remediation and monitoring obligations at the Crestview Property under
_Section 2.5(a)(xiii)_ shall be limited to that which is necessary to comply
with the commercially reasonable least stringent standards under Environmental
Law consistent with commercially reasonable cost-effective methods to achieve
such standards (including commercially reasonable deed restrictions), provided
that such standards, methods and restrictions shall not materially interfere
with or prohibit any industrial or commercial operations at the Crestview
Property as currently conducted, and further provided that such standards,
methods and restrictions are acceptable to applicable Governmental Authorities
and are sufficient to comply with applicable Laws, Orders and Permits. Parent,
Seller and any of their respective Subsidiaries shall provide Buyer with a
reasonable opportunity at Buyer's sole expense to (x) review and comment on
(such review and comment not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) Parent's, Seller's and any of their respective Subsidiaries' material
work plans, reports, and similar submittals to Governmental Authorities and
Parent, Seller and any of their respective Subsidiaries will consider in good
faith any comments proposed by Buyer, and (y) to participate in substantive
meetings between Parent, Seller and any of their respective Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Governmental Authorities, on the other hand, concerning
matters addressed in _Section 2.5(a)(xiii)_.

  

  

SECTION 9.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to (a) claims for fraud,
(b) disputes related to the Purchase Price adjustments in _Article II_ (which
shall be governed exclusively by _Article II_ ) or (c) claims for Taxes under
_Section 5.6_ , the indemnification provisions contained in this _Article IX_
, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of or
resulting from this Agreement or the Transactions following the Closing. The
foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this _Section 9.10_ shall limit or
restrict the ability or right of any party hereto to seek injunctive or other
equitable relief pursuant to _Section 10.17_ for any breach or alleged breach
of any provision of _Article II_ , _Article V_ , _Article IX_ or _Article X_
of this Agreement; _provided_ , that any procedures in respect of and
limitations on Losses or Liabilities in this _Article IX_ , to the extent
applicable, shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such relief.
Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, except as
contemplated by this _Section 9.10_ , the Indemnified Parties may not avoid
any limitation on Liability by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of Liability, all of which are hereby waived. The
parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on the remedies hereunder with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions (including _Section 9.2_ and _Section
9.4_ ) were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder.

ARTICLE X 
  
  MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

SECTION 10.1 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims, disputes,
controversies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
(including any schedule or exhibit hereto) or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim, dispute, controversy or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal Laws, and not the Laws governing conflicts of Laws (other
than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law), of
the State of New York.

  

  

SECTION 10.2 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Parties_. Each of Parent and
Seller agrees, on behalf of it and its Affiliates and each of their and their
Affiliates' respective former, current or future members, equityholders,
controlling Persons, agents and Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Parties_ ") that the Debt Financing Parties shall not be subject to any
liability or claims to the Seller Parties in connection with the Debt
Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.2_ shall in any way limit or modify
the rights and obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement or any Debt
Financing Source's obligations to the Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

SECTION 10.3 _Materiality; Disclosure Schedules_. As used in this Agreement,
unless the context would require otherwise, the term "material" and the
concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon the Sold Companies or the
Business shall be measured relative to the Sold Companies, the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, taken as a whole, as the Business is
currently being conducted. There have been included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and may be included elsewhere in
this Agreement items which are not "material" within the meaning of the
immediately preceding sentence for informational purposes and in order to
avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
agreement by Parent, Seller or Buyer that such items are "material" or to
further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement. With
respect to the Seller Disclosure Schedule and Buyer Disclosure Schedule
hereto, the disclosures made on any Schedule with respect to any
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to any
other representation or for which the applicability of such information and
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.

  

  

SECTION 10.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by Parent, Seller and Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, this _Section 10.4_ , _Section 8.3_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 10.1_
, _Section 10.2_ , _Section 10.6_ , _Section 10.13_ , _Section 10.14_ ,
_Section 10.15_ and _Section 10.17(c)_ (and any other provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is material and adverse
to a Debt Financing Source, without the prior written consent of such Debt
Financing Source.

  

  

SECTION 10.5 _Waiver_. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, which
may be lawfully waived, may be waived in writing at any time by each party
which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be binding only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such party. No failure to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute
a waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver.

  

  

SECTION 10.6 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer, Parent or Seller
(including by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , the Buyer may assign any
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement (i) to any Debt
Financing Source or any party providing bona fide debt financing to Buyer or
its Affiliates as collateral security and (ii) to any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of any Person, all of the equity interests of which
are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Guarantor, in each case without the
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

  

 

79

SECTION 10.8 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Closing Agreements and the Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes
hereto contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way
inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement
shall govern and control.

  

  

SECTION 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and each of which shall be deemed an
original.

  

  

SECTION 10.10 _Publicity; Confidentiality_.

  

  

(a) Parent, Seller and Buyer will consult with each other and will mutually
agree upon any publication or press release of any nature with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions and shall not issue any such publication or
press release prior to such consultation and agreement except as may be
required by applicable Law or by any securities exchange, in which case the
party proposing to issue such publication or press release shall make
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party or parties
and to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such publication or press release before issuing any such publication or press
release and shall provide a copy thereof to the other party or parties prior
to such issuance. The parties agree that any Securities and Exchange
Commission filing to be made in respect of the execution of this Agreement or
otherwise in respect of the Transactions shall be in the form agreed to by
Parent, Seller and Buyer.

  

  

(b) Except, and to the extent, as may be requested or required by applicable
Law (including securities laws of any jurisdiction and rules and regulations
of any applicable securities exchange) or legal, judicial or regulatory
process, from and after the date of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
each keep confidential and not directly or indirectly disclose to any third
Person (other than its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, agents and other Representatives, _provided_ , that
they shall be instructed to keep confidential) the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Closing Agreements.

  

  

(c) For a period of three (3) years, from the Closing Date, each of Parent and
Seller shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, (i)
treat all information relating to Buyer, the Sold Companies, the Purchased
Assets or the Business as confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof,
and not use or disclose to any Person such information (except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement and the other Closing Agreements) and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees,
Representatives or other agents who have had access to such information to
keep it confidential and not to use or disclose to any Person any such
information (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement and the other
Closing Agreements); _provided_ , _however_ , that, all such information that
constitutes trade secrets of the Sold Companies that (A) relate exclusively to
the Business and (B) are maintained by Parent and Seller as trade secrets as
of the Closing Date, shall be subject to the foregoing requirements for as
long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable Law. If the
disclosure of such information is required by Law or by rules and regulations
promulgated by a listing exchange, each of Parent and Seller shall cooperate
with and provide Buyer with an opportunity to object to the disclosure and
shall give Buyer as much prior written notice as is possible under the
circumstances. Each of Parent and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
any such information required by Law or such rules and regulations to be
disclosed.

  

  

(d) The provisions of _Section 10.10(c)_ shall not apply to any information
that is (i) generally available to the public or becomes available to the
public through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) developed independently
of and without reference to the information relating to the other party; (iii)
received from a third party who had a legal right to disclose such information
without restriction; or (iv) disclosed pursuant to applicable Law or Order.

  

  

SECTION 10.11 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

  

 

82  

  

SECTION 10.12 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction;
_provided_ that the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon
(including provisions that, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in
_Section 10.17(c)_, payment of the Buyer Termination Fee be the exclusive
remedy for the recipient thereof and the limitation on liabilities of the
Specified Person) contained in _Section 8.3_ and _Section 10.17(c)_ be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party's
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing or the Buyer
Guarantee.

  

  

SECTION 10.13 _Third Parties_. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns, (b) _Section 5.6_ , which is
intended to benefit the Persons specified therein, (c) _Article IX_, this
_Section 10.13_ , _Section 10.14_ and _Section 10.15_ , which the Indemnified
Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled
to rely on and enforce, (d) the DandO Indemnified Parties as set forth in
_Section 5.18_ ; provided, however, that the parties specifically acknowledge
that the Debt Financing Sources are intended third party beneficiaries of the
provisions of this _Section 10.13_ , _Section 8.3_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section
10.1_ , _Section 10.2_ , _Section 10.4_ , _Section 10.6_ , _Section 10.14_ ,
_Section 10.15_ and _Section 10.17(c)_ , in each case, to the extent
contemplated thereby, and (e) _Section 8.3_ , which is intended to benefit the
Specified Parties.

  

  

SECTION 10.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York located in the borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, for the purposes of any suit,
action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding. Each of the parties
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document to
such party's respective address listed above in one of the manners set forth
in _Section 10.7_ hereof shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process in any such suit, action or proceeding. Nothing herein shall affect
the right of any Person to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
No party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, shall bring, or support, any
Proceeding, whether at Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, anywhere other than in:
(a) any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan; or (b) if
under applicable Law, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
each party hereto agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that the
laws of the State of New York shall govern any such Action and submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforementioned courts in this _Section 10.14_.

  

  

SECTION 10.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN
ANY COURT RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLOSING AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY SCHEDULE, ANNEX OR EXHIBIT HERETO AND THERETO) OR THE BREACH,
TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF SUCH AGREEMENTS OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE OF SUCH AGREEMENTS.

  

  

SECTION 10.16 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of Parent or Seller
to Buyer under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of Seller, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by Parent or Seller.

  

 

83  

  

SECTION 10.17 _Enforcement of Agreement_.

  

  

(a) Each party acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Closing, the other
party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach
of this Agreement by Parent and Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which
any party may be entitled at law or in equity, before or after the Closing
each party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a
decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the
provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.
Each of the parties hereto further agrees that it shall not object to, or take
any position inconsistent with respect to, whether in a court of Law or
otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of the specific performance contemplated by
this _Section 10.17_ and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts set
forth in _Section 10.14_ hereof with respect to any action brought for any
such remedy.

  

  

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 10.17_ , a party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement or the Buyer Guarantee or in the event that the remedies provided
for in this _Section 10.17_ are not available or otherwise are not granted,
and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 10.17_ shall require any party to
institute any action for (or limit any party's right to institute any action
for) specific performance under this _Section 10.17_ prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 10.17_ or anything set
forth in this _Section 10.17_ restrict or limit any such party's right to
terminate this Agreement or the Buyer Guarantee in accordance with _Article
VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available
then or thereafter.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, it is
hereby acknowledged and agreed that neither Parent nor Seller shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Buyer to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to consummate the Closing in accordance with
_Article II_ unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
(other than any conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied or waived by Buyer at the time the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.8_ and Buyer fails to
complete the Closing on the date the Closing is required to have occurred,
(ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter has been funded
or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing and (iii) each of Parent and Seller has confirmed in writing that, if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then each of Parent and Seller will take all such actions in its
power to cause the Closing to occur.

  

  

SECTION 10.18 _Construction; Cooperation_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto because of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any language from prior
drafts of this Agreement, to the extent not included in the definitive version
of this Agreement executed by the parties hereto, shall not be deemed to
reflect the intention of any party hereto, or otherwise serve as parole
evidence of any kind, with respect to the Transactions.
