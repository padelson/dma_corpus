## 2.03 _Assumed Liabilities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions

to assume, and agrees to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge or cause one or

Date;

  

### (b) any Liability for Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller

### Closing to the extent based upon or arising out of the ownership prior to
the Closing of the Transferred Assets, Excluded Assets and/or the conduct
of the Business prior to the Closing.

  

## 2.05 _Transferred Sub_. As clarification of the foregoing Sections 2.01,
2.02, 2.03 and 2.04, and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that:

  

### (a) Assets and Liabilities of the Transferred Sub set forth on _Schedule
2.05(a)_ , and any assets and Liabilities of Transferred Sub not listed on
_Schedule 2.05(a)_ that do not relate exclusively to the Business, shall be
transferred from the Transferred Sub and assumed by Seller or its
Subsidiaries on or before the day preceding the Closing Date, and shall be
treated in a manner consistent with the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ that all Liabilities
related to such assets transferred pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall be
fully paid or otherwise satisfied (or, if not, shall be transferred from
Transferred Sub such that Transferred Sub has no further obligation
or liability with respect thereto).

  

### (b) Any and all assets and Liabilities of Transferred Sub not set forth
on _Schedule 2.05(a)_ that relate exclusively to the Business, subject to
Section 2.05(d) below, shall remain assets and Liabilities of the Transferred
Sub upon and after the Closing.

  

### (c) Any assets and Liabilities relating to employee benefits of the
nature described on  _Schedule 3.14(d)_ that the Parties may mutually agree
will be transferred or subcontracted by Seller or its Subsidiaries and
assumed by Buyer or its Buyer Designee or Transferred Sub shall be assumed
assets or Liabilities of Buyer, a Buyer Designee or Transferred Sub, as
applicable.

  

### (d) Liabilities of Transferred Sub with respect to any Transferred Sub
employees who do not become Transferred Employees shall be fully paid or
otherwise satisfied (or, if not, shall be transferred from Transferred Sub
such that Transferred Sub has no further obligation or liability with respect
thereto) on or before the Closing.

  

### (e) Buyer or its Buyer Designee shall acquire the Transferred Shares at
the Closing, at which time the Transferred Sub shall become a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Buyer or such Buyer Designee.

  

## 2.06 _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_.

  

### (a) Anything in this Agreement or any other Acquisition Document to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without
the consent of a party thereto or the receipt of any Government Approvals or
the satisfaction of any other requirement thereof, would constitute a breach
or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of
Buyer, Seller or any of Sellers Subsidiaries thereunder. Seller and Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts (but without any payment of money by
Seller or Buyer except as provided in Section 5.07) to obtain the consent of
the other parties to any such Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to Buyer as Buyer may
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall have no
obligation to assign or transfer Contracts, including any licenses

     

   

### of Intellectual Property or any licenses granted by Seller in connection
with the sale, distribution and license of Products in the ordinary course of
business, that are not Assumed Contracts. If such consent or Government
Approval is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder so that
Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, for the Assumed Contracts
set forth on _Schedule 2.06_ , Seller and Buyer will cooperate to discuss and
determine feasible arrangements under which Buyer would obtain the benefits
and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement to
the extent of Sellers rights thereunder, including potential sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer (but no more extensive
than Sellers existing rights with respect to the Business), or under which
Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Sellers
obligations, any and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto.

  

### (b) After the Closing: (i) if Seller or any of its Subsidiaries receives
any payment, refund or other amount that is a Transferred Asset or is
otherwise properly due and owing to Buyer in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Seller promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted,
such amount to Buyer and (ii) if Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries receive any
payment, refund or other amount that is an Excluded Asset or is otherwise
properly due and owing to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, Buyer promptly shall remit, or shall cause
to be remitted, such amount to Seller, in each case subject to Section 5.11.

  

## 2.07 _Consideration_. The consideration payable by Buyer to Seller and
Subsidiary Sellers for the Transferred Assets and Transferred Shares
shall reflect an aggregate purchase price of Six Hundred Million
Dollars ($600,000,000) plus the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, and
shall consist of:

  

### (a) to Subsidiary Sellers, an aggregate amount equal to the value of the
Transferred Sub immediately prior to the Closing as determined by Seller in
good faith by written notice to Buyer, payable in cash and/or shares of Buyer
Common Stock as elected by Seller in its sole discretion by written notice
provided to Buyer no less than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, and
each such Subsidiary Seller shall receive the percentage of such aggregate
amount set forth on _Schedule 3.23_ (to the extent in cash, collectively, the
" _Subsidiary Sellers Cash Consideration_ " and, to the extent in Buyer
Common Stock, collectively, the " _Subsidiary Sellers Stock Consideration_
");

  

### (b) to Seller, an aggregate amount equal to Six Hundred Million Dollars
($600,000,000) less the aggregate amount paid with respect to the Transferred
Sub in Section 2.07(a), payable either in cash or in a combination of cash
and/or shares of Buyer Common Stock as elected by Seller in its sole
discretion by written notice provided to Buyer no less than three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing;  _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall the aggregate value of the Stock Consideration issued pursuant
to Section 2.07(a) and (b) exceed One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000)
(to the extent in cash, the " _Seller Cash Consideration_ ", and to the
extent in Buyer Common Stock, the " _Seller Stock Consideration_ "); and

  

### (c) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer (together with the
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, the " _Consideration_ ").

  

For purposes of this Section 2.07, each determination with respect to Buyer
Common Stock shall be based upon the Buyer Stock Market Price.

     

   

2.08 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Transferred
Assets and Transferred Shares hereunder (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 1881 Page Mill Road,
Palo Alto, CA 94304 on the date that is five (5) days after satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Article VI or at such other place or in such
manner as the Parties may agree. At the Closing:

  

### (a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Bill of Sale and, simultaneously
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller,
through its officers, agents and employees, will put Buyer in possession of
all tangible Transferred Assets at the facilities where they are located as
of the Effective Time;

  

### (b) To the extent not previously executed and delivered by the Parties to
become effective upon Closing, Seller and Buyer each shall execute and
deliver (or cause their applicable Affiliates or Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver) each of the Acquisition Documents to which it is (or they are) a
party;

  

### (c) Buyer shall pay to Seller (for the account of all Selling Parties)
the Seller Cash Consideration and Subsidiary Sellers Cash Consideration, if
any, by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

  

### (d) Buyer shall deliver the certificates representing any Seller Stock
Consideration to Seller;

  

### (e) Buyer shall deliver the certificates representing any Subsidiary
Sellers Stock Consideration to Subsidiary Sellers;

  

### (f) Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver a delivery protocol
relating to the manner for delivery of any software that is a Transferred
Asset;

  

### (g) Subsidiary Sellers shall deliver all certificates or instruments
representing the Transferred Shares duly endorsed and accompanied by
necessary documentation for transfer; and

  

### (h) Seller shall furnish Buyer with the following documents regarding the
Transferred Sub:

  

#### (i) the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Transferred Sub and
all amendments thereto, duly certified by the proper officials of the State
of Israel;

  

#### (ii) resignations, effective on the Closing Date, of those officers and
directors of the Transferred Sub; and

  

#### (iii) the complete and correct corporate minute books and reports filed
with the Registrar of Companies (including registration of stock transfers)
of Transferred Sub.

  

# **ARTICLE III**

  

# **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER**

  

Subject to such exceptions that are (i) disclosed in the disclosure schedules
dated as of the date hereof and delivered with this Agreement (" _Seller
Disclosure Schedules_ ") or (ii) disclosed

     

   

pursuant to Section 5.02 (but without limiting Buyers indemnification rights
with respect to such supplements or amendments as provided in Section
5.02(a)), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

  

## 3.01 _Existence and Good Standing_. Each Selling Party and Transferred
Sub is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all corporate power and authority
required to carry on its business as now conducted and to own and operate the
Business as now owned and operated by it. Each Selling Party and
Transferred Sub is qualified to conduct business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which it conducts the Business other than such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  

## 3.02 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution and delivery by
Seller, and the performance by each Selling Party of this Agreement and the
other Acquisition Documents, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, are within the Selling Partys corporate
powers and have been, or will have been prior to Closing, duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on such Selling Partys part. This Agreement
has been and, when executed prior to or at the Closing, the other Acquisition
Documents will have been, duly and validly executed by the Selling Party who
is party thereto and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Acquisition Documents to which it is a party by Buyer
and/or a Buyer Designee (as applicable), will constitute the legal, valid and
binding agreement of such Selling Party, enforceable against it in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to creditors rights generally or to general principles of
equity.

  

## 3.03 _Governmental or Other Authorization_. Other than notification
pursuant to the HSR Act and applications or other submissions or filings
under similar merger notification laws or regulations of foreign
Governmental Authorities, and other than as set forth on _Schedule 3.03_ ,
the execution, delivery and performance by each Selling Party of this
Agreement and the other Acquisition Documents, and the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, require no Governmental
Approval from any Governmental Authority (such required consents, waivers and
approvals, the " _Seller Approvals_ ").

  

## 3.04 _Non-Contravention_. Except for matters that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Acquisition
Documents by the Selling Parties, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not (a) contravene or
conflict with the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
documents of the Selling Parties or Transferred Sub, (b) assuming receipt of
the Seller Approvals that are Governmental Approvals, contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any Applicable Law binding upon or
applicable to any Selling Party, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred
Shares or (c) assuming receipt of any other required approvals that are not
Governmental Approvals and of the Material Contract Consents, (i) constitute
a default under, give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
modification, or acceleration of, or a loss of any material benefit under any
Material Contract, (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any material
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on the

   

20   

 

  

Transferred Assets or the Transferred Shares, or (iii) constitute a breach,
default or violation of any commitment, judgment, injunction or decree.

  

## 3.05 _Personal Property_. The Selling Parties and Transferred Sub have
good and marketable title to all of the tangible personal property that is a
Transferred Asset or the tangible personal property of the Transferred Sub,
respectively. None of such personal property is subject to any Lien other

## 5.01 _Access to Information_.

  

### (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller agrees to provide to
Buyer and its authorized agents (including its attorneys and accountants
and auditors) reasonable access to the offices and properties of the Business
and the books and records of (i) Seller exclusively relating to the
Transferred Assets and (ii) Transferred Sub, upon reasonable prior notice,
during normal business hours, under Sellers supervision and at Buyers
expense, in order to conduct a review of the Transferred Assets and the
Business. Each of the Parties hereto will hold, and will cause its
consultants and advisers and other representatives to hold, in confidence all
documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of another Party to
this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements (and, after the Closing, the
Parties shall hold in confidence all information regarding the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Excluded Liabilities and the Business Employees) as
"confidential information" pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality and
Nondisclosure Agreement No. 98074 dated September 24, 1997 entered into
between Seller and Buyer (together with Addendum No. 1 thereto effective
December 21, 2005 and Addendum No. 2 thereto dated May 8, 2006, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), notwithstanding any contrary terms in Section
1 of the Confidentiality Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event Seller provides Buyer or any of Buyers Subsidiaries with access to
Intellectual Property that constitutes highly sensitive proprietary
information, as determined by Seller in its sole discretion, Seller will
designate such Intellectual Property as highly sensitive in a written notice
provided to Buyer (" _Specially Designated Intellectual Property_ "), and
Buyers or Buyers Subsidiarys use of such Specially Designated Intellectual
Property or other exercise of any rights granted under this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements with respect to such Specially Designated
Intellectual Property shall be conditioned upon its strict compliance with
the reasonable Intellectual Property protection measures that Seller will
designate for such Specially Designated Intellectual Property in such written
notice. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its
acceptance, use, review or other exploitation of any Specially Designated
Intellectual Property shall be deemed to constitute its irrevocable
acceptance of and agreement to such additional terms, conditions and
restrictions provided by Seller with respect to such Specially Designated
Intellectual Property, without any other acknowledgment or action by Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in
the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall not apply to any Specially Designated Intellectual Property. Nothing in
this Article V limits Buyers obligations or any restrictions relating to any
Specially Designated Licensed Trade Secrets.

  

### (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause each Buyer Designee to, maintain all of
the books and records pertaining to Transferred Sub, Transferred Shares,
Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities before the Closing that are in
its possession for such period as may be required by Applicable Law relating
to the relevant books and records. After the Closing and for so long as the
same shall be retained by Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, Buyer or such Buyer Designee shall provide Seller and its
representatives, upon notice from Seller,

     

   

### with reasonable access to such books and records upon the same terms and
conditions as set forth in Section 5.01(a), _mutatis mutandis_. If, at any
time after the Closing and until such expiration of the period of retention
of records as required under Applicable Law, Buyer or such Buyer Designee
proposes to dispose of any of such books and records, Buyer or such Buyer
Designee shall first offer to deliver the same to Seller at the expense of
Seller.

  

### (c) Following the Closing, each Party (the " _Possessing Party_ ") will
afford the other Party (the " _Receiving Party_ "), its counsel and
its accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable access to
information relating to the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Shares or the
Transferred Sub in the Possessing Partys possession or under the Possessing
Partys control and, to the extent reasonably requested, will provide copies
and extracts therefrom, all to the extent that such access may be
reasonably required by the Receiving Party in connection with (i) the
preparation of Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority or the prosecution or defense of any claim or proceeding relating
to any Tax Return or (ii) compliance with the requirements of any
Governmental Authority.

  

## 5.02 _Additions to and Modification of Schedules_.

  

### (a) Subject to subsection (b), if on any date on or prior to the Closing
Date, a Party determines that any of the information in any representation,
warranty or schedule of such Party (including the Seller Disclosure Schedules
and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable) provided on the date
hereof is not true, accurate and complete in all material respects, such
Party shall be entitled to amend the schedules relating to such Party to make
additions to or modifications of such schedules (and to add new schedules not
previously included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Buyer Disclosure
Schedules, respectively, with respect to the representations and warranties
in Articles III and IV, respectively) necessary to make the information set
forth in such representation, warranty or schedule true, accurate and
complete in all material respects, and such representations, warranties and
schedules shall thereupon be deemed amended to reflect such additions and
modifications for all purposes except as provided herein, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not be permitted to amend _Schedule 2.05(a)_ to
add assets or Liabilities of the Transferred Sub that are exclusively related
to the Business without the consent of Buyer.  For any additions or
modifications made to correct inaccuracies of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III or Article IV, respectively (including
those representations and warranties which are expressed with respect to a
date prior to the date hereof) for facts, events or circumstances occurring
prior to or existing on and disclosable as of the date hereof, the non-
amending Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
the provisions set forth in Article VII.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
such supplement or amendment may be made with respect to a Contract in
existence on the date hereof if such Contract (together with all other such
Contracts disclosed in amendments and supplements pursuant to this Section
5.02(a) but which were not listed on _Schedule 2.01(c)_ or _Schedule 2.01(d)_
as of the date of the execution of this Agreement) involves or (to the extent
reasonably apparent on the face of such Contract) would involve monetary
liabilities or obligations in excess of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000)
in the aggregate.  All Liabilities under such Contracts in excess of such
aggregate amount shall be deemed "Excluded Liabilities" for all purposes
hereunder.

     

   

### (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), not less than two (2) days prior to
the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a supplement to the schedules
to this Agreement (other than the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Buyer
Disclosure Schedules, respectively) with respect to facts, events or
circumstances arising after the date hereof, but any such supplement will be
disregarded and have no further force and effect hereunder for any purposes
unless such supplement: (i) is consented to in writing by Buyer or (ii)
derives from actions by Seller and its Subsidiaries that are either expressly
permitted in this Agreement or not prohibited by Article V (and if such
supplement complies with either of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
it shall be deemed a " _Permitted Post-Signing Supplement_ "). Permitted
Post-Signing Supplements shall also include supplements delivered to Buyer
within the foregoing time period that disclose any of the following: (i)
those Contracts relating exclusively to the Business entered into by a
Selling Party or Transferred Sub after the date of this Agreement, and such
Contracts identified on such supplement to _Schedule 2.01(c)_ , _Schedule
2.01(d)_  or _Schedule 3.08_ , respectively, shall be deemed to be Assumed
Contracts or Transferred Sub Contracts, respectively, for all purposes
hereof, _provided_ that such Contracts were entered into in accordance with
the terms of Article V or otherwise with the consent of Buyer (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) other assets relating exclusively to the
Business acquired by a Selling Party after the date of this Agreement which
would have been "Transferred Assets" if such assets were owned or held by a
Selling Party as of the date hereof, and such assets identified on such
supplement to _Schedule 2.01_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be Transferred Assets, and (iii) other Liabilities
relating exclusively to the Business incurred by a Selling Party or
Transferred Sub after the date of this Agreement which would have been
"Assumed Liabilities" or Liabilities of Transferred Sub if such Liabilities
had been in existence as Liabilities of such Selling Party or Transferred Sub
as of the date hereof, and such Liabilities identified on such supplement to
_Schedule 2.03_ shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities, _provided_
that such Liabilities were incurred in accordance with Article V hereof or
otherwise with the consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Schedule 2.05(a)_ may not be
updated to add assets or Liabilities of Transferred Sub that are exclusively
related to the Business without the consent of Buyer.

  

### (c) Other than as set forth in Section 5.02(a) and (b), no Party may make
any changes, supplements, amendments or modifications to the schedules
to this Agreement with respect to any fact, event or circumstance occurring
after the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall the inaccuracy of a representation and warranty
give rise to a right of any Party to terminate this Agreement.

  

## 5.03 _Compliance with Terms of Governmental Approvals and Consents_. From
and after the Closing Date, Buyer and each Buyer Designee shall comply at its
own expense with all conditions and requirements imposed on Buyer or such
Buyer Designee as set forth in (a) Buyer Approvals that are Governmental
Approvals, to the extent necessary such that all such Governmental Approvals
will remain in full force and effect assuming, if applicable,
continued compliance with the terms thereof by Seller and (b) all Buyer
Approvals of Persons other than Governmental Authorities, to the extent
necessary such that all such consents and approvals will remain effective and
enforceable against the Persons giving such consents and approvals, assuming,
if applicable, continued compliance with the terms thereof by Seller. The
parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
prior to the Closing of the Investment Center in the Ministry of Industry,
Trade and Labor of Israel (the " _Investment Center_ ") to the

     

   

## transfer by the Subsidiary Sellers of the Transferred Shares **.
**Further, Buyer agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Buyer Designees
acquiring the Transferred Shares to, continue to operate Transferred Sub in
accordance with the requirements of the Investment Center, including those
set forth in the applicable letters of approval and the applicable
certificates with respect to the completion of the capital investments issued
by the Investment Center. Seller shall be responsible for liabilities (other
than Taxes, which are governed by Section 5.09(h)(vi)) imposed on Transferred
Sub on or following the Closing Date to the extent such
liabilities constitute the recapture of an incentive that either reduced
liabilities of Transferred Sub with respect to a period, or was paid to
Transferred Sub, prior to the Closing Date, but only to the extent such
recapture is a direct result of the failure of the Investment Center to
approve the transfer of the Transferred Shares to Buyer or Buyer Designee
pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that Buyer has complied with
its obligations under this Section 5.03 with respect to obtaining such
approval and has not taken or refrained from taking action that prevented
such approval. Buyer and Transferred Sub shall be responsible for all other
recapture of incentives received by Transferred Sub.

  

## 5.04 _Use of Marks_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no interest in or right to use the name "Taurus" or any derivation
thereof or any other Trademarks, service marks or trade names of Seller (the
" _Retained Marks_ ") is being transferred or otherwise licensed to Buyer or
any Buyer Designee pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer agrees not to use and agrees to cause each Buyer Designee
not to use any materials bearing Retained Marks or sell, transfer, or ship
any products bearing Retained Marks (a) unless requested to do so by Seller,
(b) except to the extent displayed on the hardcopy (non-electronic) form of
such materials delivered to Buyer and/or a Buyer Designee at the Closing or
(c) except as required under Assumed Contracts or Transferred Sub Contracts
with customers, _provided_ that such use, for each of (a) through (c), shall
only be permitted until the date which is ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date. The foregoing rights are subject to Sellers standard Trademark usage
guidelines, a copy of which has been provided to Buyer, and Seller reserves
the right to practice quality control with regard to its marks. Upon the
expiration of the foregoing license, all materials bearing any Retained Mark
in the possession or control of Buyer or its agents shall be promptly
destroyed.  Prior to any distribution of any materials bearing Retained
Marks, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to redact or
modify such materials in order to minimize or eliminate the use of the
Retained Marks. Nothing in this section shall prevent Buyer from engaging in
Fair Use or nominative fair use of the Retained Marks, to the extent
permissible under the U.S. Trademark Act or common law.

  

## 5.05 _Cooperation_.

  

### (a) After the Closing, each Party shall provide such assistance
and cooperation as the other Party or its counsel may reasonably request
in connection with any claims or Proceedings relating to the Business or
the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Shares or any pending
Intellectual Property. Each Party shall reimburse the other for reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the other in assisting such
Party pursuant to this Section 5.05. No Party shall be required by this
Section 5.05 to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations.

     

   

### (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to seek and obtain from the SEC such waivers
of, or relief from, the requirements pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X
or such other securities laws applicable to the audited financial statements
contemplated by Section 6.01(f) as reasonably requested by Seller.

  

## 5.06 _Assignments_. Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
transferring the Transferred Intellectual Property, including any pending
applications and registrations for the registered Intellectual Property,
_provided_ , _however_ , that as of the Closing Date and except as provided
in Section 5.05, Seller shall have or incur no further obligations or
expenses in connection therewith, and it shall be the sole responsibility of
Buyer to pursue, protect, or perfect any such rights as it may see fit in its
sole discretion.

  

## 5.07 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_. Commencing as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, Seller will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Material Contract Consents. Each
Party agrees to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other commercially reasonable
actions as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to (a) satisfy
the conditions set forth in Article VI or otherwise consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Acquisition Documents or (b) obtain any Material Contract Consents and also
to obtain from Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Acquisition Documents and to promptly make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement required under the HSR Act, and any filings under similar merger
notification laws or regulations of foreign Governmental Authorities. Seller
and Buyer shall keep each other timely apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries from, the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice and similar
Governmental Authorities in other jurisdictions, and shall comply promptly
with any such inquiry or request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
set forth on _Schedule 5.07_ , no Party shall have any obligation to expend
any funds, commence or participate in any litigation, or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including, by way of illustration only,
any payment in connection with obtaining the Material Contract Consents,
Seller Approvals or Buyer Approvals) other than normal out-of-pocket expenses
(such as fees of counsel, accountants and auditors) reasonably necessary to
consummate such transactions or consent fees, amendment fees, cost,
reimbursement provisions or the like set forth in the applicable Assumed
Contract or Transferred Sub Contract in question. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer will be solely responsible for obtaining any third party
licenses in connection with the operation of the Business after the Closing.

  

## 5.08 _Public Announcements_. Neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Acquisition Documents without the prior written
consent of Buyer (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in the case of Buyer),
except as may be required by Applicable Law, or by the rules and regulations
of, or pursuant to any agreement with, Nasdaq. If any party determines, with
the advice of counsel, that it is required by Applicable Law to make any
public announcement of or disclosure of this Agreement, any of the

     

   

## other Acquisition Documents, or any terms hereof or thereof, it shall, a
reasonable time before making any public announcement or disclosure, consult
with the other Party regarding such disclosure and seek confidential
treatment for such terms or portions of such announcement of or disclosure of
this Agreement or such other Acquisition Document as may be requested by the
other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not contact any of the
customers of Seller or employees of Seller without the presence of a
representative of Seller with respect to the Business or any Transferred
Asset.

  

## 5.09 _Allocation of Expenses; Tax Matters_.

  

### (a) _Allocation of Non-Tax Operating Expenses_. All utility charges, gas
charges, electric charges, water charges, water rents and sewer rents, if
any, shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller as of the Closing Date
(Seller being liable for that portion of the period up to and including the

period on and after the Closing Date), computed on the basis of the most
recent meter charges or, in the case of annual charges, on the basis of the
established fiscal year. All Prepayments (including lease expenses but
excluding Taxes) paid by Seller prior to the Closing Date and all other
operating expenses paid by Buyer with respect to the operation of the
Business on or after the Closing shall be apportioned between Buyer and
Seller as of the Closing Date computed on the basis of the applicable time
period to which expenses apply.  Within a reasonable period after the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall present a statement to the other setting
forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under this
Section 5.09(a), together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the proration amount. Such amount shall be paid by
the Party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery of
such statement.

  

### (b) _Allocation of Property Taxes_. With respect to Seller and each
Subsidiary of Seller other than Transferred Sub, all real property taxes,
personal property taxes and similar _ad valorem_  obligations levied with
respect to the Transferred Assets for a taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer as of the Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable
period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such
taxable period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.  Within a
reasonable period after the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall present a
statement to the other setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which
each is entitled under this Section 5.09(b), together with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The
proration amount shall be paid by the Party owing it to the other within ten
(10) days after delivery of such statement. Thereafter, Seller shall notify
Buyer upon receipt of any bill for personal property taxes relating to the
Transferred Assets, part or all of which are attributable to the Post-Closing
Tax Period, and shall promptly deliver such bill to Buyer who shall pay the
same to the appropriate taxing authority; _provided,_ that if such bill covers
any part of the Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall also remit prior to the
due date of such taxes to Buyer payment for the proportionate amount of such
bill that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event that
either Seller or Buyer shall thereafter make a payment for which it is
entitled to reimbursement under this Section 5.09(b), the other Party shall
make such reimbursement promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after the presentation of a statement setting

     

   

### forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of reimbursement. Any payment required under
this Section 5.09(b) and not made when due shall bear interest at the rate
of ten percent (10%) per annum.

  

### (c) _Payment of Taxes_.  Taxes described in Section 5.09(b), Section
5.09(f) or Section 5.09(h) shall be timely paid, and all applicable filings,
reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by Applicable Law.  The
paying Party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying Party in
accordance with Section 5.09(b), Section 5.09(f) or Section 5.09(h), as the
case may be. Upon payment of such Tax, the paying Party shall present a
statement to the non-paying Party setting forth the amount of reimbursement
to which the paying Party is entitled under Section 5.09(b), Section 5.09(f)
or Section 5.09(h), as the case may be, along with such supporting evidence
as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement. Any
payment required under this Section 5.09(c) and not made when due shall bear
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.

  

### (d) _Cooperation_. As to the Taxes that are subject to Section 5.09(b),
Section 5.09(f) or Section 5.09(h) from and after the Closing Date, the
Parties hereto agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to the Transferred Assets, Transferred Sub and the Business as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by
any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim or
Proceeding relating to any Tax Return.  The Parties hereto shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding related to
Taxes involving the Business and each shall execute and deliver such powers
of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of
this Section 5.09(d).

  

### (e) _Responsibility for Payment of Taxes_. Taxes attributable to the
Transferred Assets or the Business other than those treated specifically in
Section 5.09(b) and Section 5.09(f), and Section 5.09(h), shall be borne by
the Party incurring such Taxes (other than solely by reason of successor
liability or similar provisions of law) under Applicable Law, and each Party
shall indemnify, defend and hold the other Party harmless from and against
all Taxes for which such Party is liable pursuant to this Section 5.09(e).
Other than with respect to Tax Returns of the Transferred Sub, responsibility
for which is governed by Section 5.09(h), Buyer shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) on a timely basis all Tax Returns with
respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets (other than Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by Selling Parties under Applicable Law) for
all taxable periods beginning on or after the Closing Date, shall pay all
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, and shall indemnify and hold
Seller harmless against, from and in respect of all Taxes (i) for any taxable
year or period commencing on the Closing Date and (ii) for any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date, other than Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Taxes that are
the responsibility of Seller pursuant to Sections 5.09(b), 5.09(f)
and 5.09(h). The provisions of Section 5.09(c) regarding payment,
verification, and interest shall apply to the Taxes that are subject to this
Section 5.09(e).

  

### (f) _Sales and Use Taxes_.  All excise, value added, registration, stamp,
recording, documentary, conveyancing, transfer, sales, use and any other
similar Taxes arising out of the transfer of the Transferred Assets, the
Business, the Transferred Shares or the assumption of the

     

   

### Assumed Liabilities (the " _Sales Tax_ ") shall be determined as soon as
practicable after Closing and fifty percent (50%) of such Sales Tax shall be
paid by Buyer and one half (50%) of such Sales Tax shall be paid by Seller;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer or its Affiliates shall pay one hundred
percent (100%) of all Sales Taxes to the extent the payment thereof by Buyer
or such Affiliates gives rise to a right to claim a refund of or credit
against Taxes otherwise payable by Buyer or its Affiliates under Applicable
Law (" _Buyer Sales Tax_ "). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate fully in minimizing the Sales Tax,
including arranging for the electronic transfer of any Transferred Assets
where not unduly burdensome. To the extent a taxing authority provides
notice to a Party of an audit of the Sales Tax (other than a notice to Buyer
solely with respect to a Buyer Sales Tax), such Party shall immediately
notify the other Party and Seller and Buyer shall each assume responsibility
for such audit and shall each pay when due one half of any additional Sales
Tax ultimately assessed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that Buyer shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of any
Buyer Sales Tax resulting from such audit.  Buyer shall have authority to
control, settle or defend any proposed adjustment to the Sales Tax subject to
Sellers approval, and Seller shall cooperate as reasonably requested by
Buyer in its defense or settlement of any proposed adjustment to the Sales
Tax.

  

### (g) _Withholding_. In the event that any Party is prohibited by
Applicable Law from making payments to the other Party unless the paying
Party deducts or withholds Taxes therefrom and remits such Taxes to the local
taxing jurisdiction, then such paying Party shall duly withhold and remit
such Taxes and shall pay to the other Party the remaining net amount after
the Taxes have been withheld. The paying Party shall promptly furnish
the other Party with a copy of an official Tax receipt or other
appropriate evidence of any Taxes imposed on payments made under this
Agreement. Each Party is responsible for its own respective income taxes or
taxes based upon gross revenues, including business and occupation taxes.
Nothing in this Section 5.09(g) shall reduce or diminish the Parties
obligations under Section 5.09(f), the intent of which is to cause each of
Buyer and Seller to bear fifty percent (50%) of all Sales Tax other than
Buyer Sales Tax, and for Buyer to bear one hundred percent (100%) of all
Buyer Sales Tax, and any withholding of Sales Tax under this Section 5.09(g)
shall be taken into account in applying Section 5.09(f).

  

### (h) _Taxes of Transferred Sub_.

  

(i) Each of Buyer and Seller will promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments with
respect to Taxes of Transferred Sub for which such other Party (or such other
Partys Affiliates) may be liable hereunder. Seller shall
assume responsibility for and control the conduct of any audit related to
Taxes of Transferred Sub for any taxable period the majority of the days of
which occur prior to the Closing. In connection with any such audit
involving the Israeli Tax Authority (or any similar or successor Governmental
Authority) and for which Seller has responsibility, Buyer agrees to appoint
or cause to be appointed as representatives for Transferred Sub, working on
behalf of Seller, KPMG Somekh Chaikin (or such other firm of accountants or
lawyers nationally recognized in Israel as Seller determines). The Party that
is (or whose Affiliates are) in control of an audit of Transferred Sub shall
not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim for Taxes that
would adversely affect the other Party or its Affiliates without the written
consent of such other Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     

   

(ii) Seller shall be responsible for the following Taxes: (i) Taxes imposed
on Transferred Sub with respect to taxable periods ending before the Closing
Date, (ii) with respect to taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date
and ending on or after the Closing Date, Taxes imposed on Transferred Sub
which are allocable, pursuant to Section 5.09(h)(iv) hereof, to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and (iii) Taxes arising on the Closing Date that arise
out of the ordinary course of business of Transferred Sub as a result of
actions taken by or at the request of Seller or its Affiliates; _provided,
however_ , that if there is an adjustment to a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period that results in a Tax benefit with respect to a Post-Closing Tax
Period, Sellers obligation with respect to such adjustment shall be reduced
by such Tax benefit; _provided, further,_ that Seller shall be responsible
for Taxes to the extent described in Section 5.09(h)(vi)(A), but not for
Taxes described in Section 5.09(h)(vi)(B). Seller shall be treated as having
paid any such amounts that are paid in respect of any such Taxes by
Transferred Sub, Seller or Sellers Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer and Transferred Sub shall be responsible for Taxes imposed on
Transferred Sub arising on the Closing Date, except to the extent of (A)
Sales Taxes imposed on Transferred Sub arising on the Closing Date for which
Seller is responsible as provided in Section 5.09(f), and (B) Taxes (other
than Sales Taxes) imposed on Transferred Sub arising on the Closing Date that
arise out of the ordinary course of business of Transferred Sub as a result
of actions taken by or at the request of Seller or its Affiliates; _provided,
further,_  that Buyer and Transferred Sub shall be responsible for Taxes to
the extent described in Section 5.09(h)(vi)(B), but not for Taxes described
in Section 5.09(h)(vi)(A). Buyer and Transferred Sub shall also be
responsible for all Taxes of Transferred Sub attributable to Post-Closing Tax
Periods, other than such Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant
to this Section 5.09(h)(ii).  Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns of Transferred Sub for taxable periods ending prior to the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns
of Transferred Sub for taxable periods including and ending on or after the
Closing Date. To the extent Seller cannot file such Tax Returns under
Applicable Law, Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) such Tax
Returns to Buyer before the due date (including extensions) for the filing
thereof, and Buyer shall sign and file or cause to be signed and filed such
Tax Returns no later than such due date. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of Transferred Sub except
as otherwise required by Applicable Law. To the extent permitted or required
by Applicable Law or administrative practice, the taxable year of Transferred
Sub that includes the Closing Date shall be closed as of the end of the day
prior to (or at the beginning of) the Closing Date. If any Party is liable
hereunder for any portion of the Tax shown due on any Tax Return required to
be filed by any other Party, the Party preparing such Tax Return will deliver
a copy of the relevant portions of such Tax Return to the Party so liable for
its review and approval not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is due to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions), together with a statement showing the other Partys obligations
for Taxes relating to such Tax Return, which shall be paid no later than the
due date of such Taxes (or, if later, fifteen (15) days following receipt of
such Tax Return), and shall accrue interest if not timely paid, as provided
in Section 5.09(c). If the Parties disagree as to any item reflected on any
such Tax Return, the Parties will jointly request a third party accounting
firm to resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as possible. The decision of
such third party accounting firm will be final and binding on the parties,
and the expenses of such accounting firm will be shared equally by Seller and
Buyer.

   

42   

 

  

(iii) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall, nor shall Seller or Buyer cause or
permit the Transferred Sub or its Affiliates to, amend, refile, or otherwise
modify any Tax Return relating to Transferred Sub with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period if such amendment, refiling or modification could
adversely affect Seller.

  

(iv) In the case of Taxes of Transferred Sub that are payable with respect to
a taxable period that begins before and ends on or after the Closing Date,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period
ending on the day before the Closing Date shall be:

  

(A) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to
income, sales, receipts, payroll or other items of income or expense, or (y)
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment
of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended at the close of
business on the day before the Closing Date; and

  

(B) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of Transferred Sub, or otherwise measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending the day before the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

  

(v) Seller shall be entitled to any refund of, or credit for, Taxes to the
extent such refund represents a refund of Taxes paid with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, such credit arises as a result of Taxes paid with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or such Tax represents a Sales Tax that was the
responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
if any such refund or credit results in a correlative Tax detriment to Buyer
or its Affiliates with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyers
obligation with respect to such refund or credit shall be reduced by such Tax
detriment. Buyer shall pursue such refund or credit as reasonably requested
by Seller, _provided_ that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its reasonable
out of pocket costs (including any Taxes arising from the receipt of such
refund, net of any Tax benefit of the payment thereof to Seller hereunder).

  

(vi) (A) Seller shall be responsible for Taxes imposed on Transferred Sub on
or following the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes constitute the
recapture of Tax incentives that reduced the liability of Transferred Sub for
Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, but only to the extent such
recapture is a direct result of the failure of the Investment Center to
approve the transfer of the Transferred Shares to Buyer or Buyer Designee
pursuant to this Agreement; _provided,_ that Buyer has complied with its
obligations under Section 5.03 with respect to obtaining such approval and
has not taken or refrained from taking action that prevented such approval;
and (B) Buyer and Transferred Sub shall be responsible for all other Taxes
attributable to the recapture of Tax incentives received by Transferred Sub.

  

(i) _Exclusivity of Tax Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including Article VII) this Section
5.09 contains the exclusive provisions governing the liability of the parties
for Taxes, and no claim for indemnification may be made under any other
provision hereof with respect to matters pertaining to Taxes. In the event
of a

     

   

conflict between the provisions of this Section 5.09 and any other section of
this Agreement, this Section 5.09 shall govern and control.

  

(j) _Adjustment to Cash Consideration_. The parties shall treat all
indemnification payments made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Cash Consideration for applicable Tax purposes.

  

(k) _Tax Treatment; Section 338 Election_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the purchase of the Transferred
Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a purchase of the
assets of the Transferred Sub for an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
Subsidiary Sellers Cash Consideration, (B) the fair market value as of the
Closing Date of the Subsidiary Sellers Stock Consideration, and (C) each
liability or other item of the Transferred Sub to the extent treated as
an "amount realized" for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. If requested in
writing by Seller, Buyer shall cause to be made, without cost or
obligation to Seller, a protective election under Section 338 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to the
purchase of the Transferred Shares hereby, as and when requested by Seller.

  

(l) _Israeli Tax Ruling_. Buyer has been informed that Subsidiary Sellers
intend to prepare and file with the Israeli Tax Authority an application for
a ruling determining the tax consequences to Subsidiary Sellers of the sale
of the Transferred Shares, specifically with respect to deferral of Israeli
taxation on any Subsidiary Sellers Stock Consideration received by Subsidiary
Sellers in such sale (the " _Israeli Tax Ruling_ "). Buyer agrees to, and
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its outside counsel,
advisors and accountants to, cooperate as Subsidiary Sellers reasonably
request for the purpose of procuring the Israeli Tax Ruling.

  

## 5.10 _Allocation of Consideration_. The Parties agree that, for U.S.
federal income **** Tax purposes, and where permitted all other income Tax
purposes, the Subsidiary Sellers Stock Consideration and the Subsidiary
Sellers Cash Consideration (together with certain liabilities of Transferred
Sub and other amounts) shall be treated as consideration paid for the assets
of Transferred Sub as provided in Section 5.09(k). All other consideration
paid hereunder (including the assumption of Assumed Liabilities to the extent
treated as consideration for applicable Tax purposes) shall be treated as
consideration paid for the Transferred Assets (and not the Transferred Shares
or the assets of Transferred Sub). Neither Party shall take any position
inconsistent with this Section 5.10 in any Tax Return, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

  

## 5.11 _Accounts Receivable_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall forward to
Seller, immediately upon receipt thereof, any payments of Accounts Receivable
of Seller; and Seller shall forward to Buyer, immediately upon receipt
thereof, any payments of accounts receivable of Buyer.  Promptly following
the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in advising customers to direct to
the appropriate Party any future payments by such customers. In determining
whether a payment received by either Party is a payment of an Account
Receivable of Seller or accounts receivable of Buyer, the receiving Party may
rely on any invoice or contract number referred to on the payment or in
correspondence accompanying such payment. If a payment, refund or other
amount is received by either Buyer, a Buyer Designee or a Selling Party from
an account debtor that has not designated the invoice being paid
thereby, such payment shall be applied to the earliest invoice outstanding
with respect to indebtedness of such account debtor, except for those
invoices

     

   

## which are subject to a dispute to the extent of such dispute. Following the
Closing, Buyer will, at Sellers expense, provide such cooperation as Seller
shall reasonably request in connection with Sellers collection of
outstanding Accounts Receivable of Seller.

  

## 5.12 _Accounts Payable_. To the extent that Buyer receives any invoices
for Accounts Payable or statements evidencing amounts owed by Seller to
another Party, Buyer will promptly deliver such documents to Seller.  To the
extent that Seller receives any invoices for Accounts Payable or statements
evidencing amounts owed by Buyer to another Party, Seller will promptly
deliver such documents to Buyer.

  

## 5.13 _Operation of the Business Prior to Closing_. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, except as permitted by this Agreement or
any of the other Acquisition Documents or as set forth in _Schedule 5.13_ ,
or unless Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Selling Parties and Transferred Sub
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to operate the Business in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the material business
relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors and others with whom
the Selling Parties deal in connection with the Business in the ordinary
course.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, unless Buyer shall otherwise consent
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as contemplated by this Agreement, any other Acquisition Document or
as set forth on _Schedule 5.13_ , Seller shall not (and shall cause each
other Selling Party and the Transferred Sub not to):

  

### (a) fail to maintain the Transferred Assets as a whole in at least as
good condition as they are being maintained by the Selling Parties on the
date hereof, subject to normal wear and tear;

  

### (b) sell, assign, or transfer any of the Transferred Shares and not
permit any of the Transferred Shares to be subjected to any Share
Encumbrances;

  

### (c) sell, assign, or transfer any of the Transferred Assets, except in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and not
permit any of the Transferred Assets to be subjected to any Lien, other than
(i) the Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect;

  

### (d) fail to pay or discharge when due any Liability of which the failure
to pay or discharge would reasonably be expected to cause any material damage
or loss to the Transferred Assets and Transferred Shares or Transferred Sub,
taken as a whole;

  

### (e) accelerate, amend, terminate, modify or cancel any Material Contract;

  

### (f) enter into or renew (other than an automatic renewal) any Contract
that exclusively relates to the Business that (i) provides for payment
obligations (whether by a Selling Party or the counterparty thereto) in an
aggregate amount for such Contract greater than One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) or which is reasonably likely to extend beyond 2010 (a "
_Covenant Contract_ "); (ii) would be a Covenant Contract that, according to
its terms, prohibits assignment to Buyer or Buyer Designees (or a purchaser
of the Transferred Assets) without the consent of the counterparty

     

   

### thereto; or (iii) is a Contract entered into by the Handheld
Platform Group of Seller or the Mobile Wireless Group of Seller that would
impose on Buyer or any Buyer Designee a non-competition obligation or other
use restriction;

  

### (g) fail to maintain its books and records in the usual, regular and
ordinary manner on a basis consistent with prior years, except for any change
required by a change in GAAP, change resulting from the audit of the
financial statements of the Business as contemplated in Section 6.01(f), or a
change in the accounting practices of Seller or Transferred Sub generally;

  

### (h) grant to any Business Employee any increase in compensation (except
for one-time bonuses to selected Business Employees) or in severance or
termination pay, grant any severance or termination pay, or enter into any
employment agreement with any such employee, except as may be required under
Applicable Law, Sellers termination policy or any employment or termination
agreement in effect on the date hereof or in the ordinary course of business;

  

### (i) acquire or agree to acquire any asset that would constitute
Transferred Assets, except in the ordinary course of business;

  

### (j) reduce or discount any prices of the Products, except in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice; and

  

### (k) agree or consent to do any of the foregoing.

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
subject to Section 2.05, Seller and its Subsidiaries may transfer from the
Transferred Sub (i) the assets set forth on _Schedule 2.05(a)_ , (ii) all
Cash, Accounts Receivable and Inventory, and (iii) all other Contracts,
employees and other assets and Liabilities, in each case, that are not
exclusively related to the Business.

  

## 5.14 _Employee Information and Access_. Seller agrees to provide to Buyer
certain general information concerning Sellers compensation and benefit
programs and specific information relating to individual Business Employees,
subject to Applicable Law and, to the extent required, any such employees
proper consent, solely for the purpose of Buyer formulating offers of
employment to such employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller will not
make personnel records available for inspection or copying.

  

## 5.15 _Employees_.

  

### (a) _Employment Offers_.

  

(i) Subject to Applicable Law, Buyer shall make offers of employment to each
Business Employee who is not an Excluded Employee to be effective as of the
Closing. The offers of employment for each such Business Employee who is not
an Excluded Employee will (i) subject to requirements of Applicable Law for
the jurisdiction in which the Business Employee is located, include
employment terms reasonably determined by Buyer but that, in all events, are
substantially similar to and at least as favorable to such Business Employee
as his or her existing cash compensation, and also at least as favorable with
respect to his or her equity compensation, and

     

   

including participation in all compensation and benefit programs made
available to similarly situated employees of Buyer at levels which are in the
aggregate substantially equivalent to the value of their compensation and
benefits under Sellers programs, and (ii) supersede any prior agreements
regarding the terms and conditions of employment with such Business Employee
as in effect prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, in no event shall any prior agreement with respect to Intellectual
Property be superseded, except that all Transferred Employees shall be
permitted to disclose to Buyer all information in their possession or
otherwise known by them which is directly related to the Transferred Assets
and Assumed Liabilities after the Closing, but not related to the Excluded
Assets or other confidential information of Seller.  For purposes of
clarification, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not cause any Business
Employee to disclose to Buyer confidential information related to the
Business, except as permitted by Seller.

  

(ii) To the greatest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer shall provide
service credit for all periods of service by the Transferred Employees under
Buyers employee policies and plans except to the extent such service credit
would result in the duplication of benefit accrual for the same period of
service.  Buyer shall be responsible for all Liabilities, salaries, benefits
and similar employer obligations that arise after Closing under
Buyers compensation and benefit plans and policies for all Transferred
Employees or pursuant to Section 2.03(d) and as may be agreed by the Parties
pursuant to Section 2.05(c). In particular, Buyer shall be responsible for
Liabilities with respect to the termination of any Transferred Employees by
Buyer after the Closing, including health care continuation coverage with
respect to plans established or maintained by Buyer after the Closing to the
extent that the Transferred Employees participate therein, and damages or
settlements arising out of any claims of wrongful or illegal termination by
Buyer following the Closing, and for complying with the requirements of all
Applicable Laws with respect to any such termination by Buyer after the
Closing.

  

(iii) Except with respect to Transferred Employees who are employees of the
Transferred Sub, subject to Applicable Law, Seller shall be solely
responsible for (i) any liabilities or obligations with respect to the
Business Employees including the Transferred Employees, that arise prior to
the Closing, (ii) any liabilities or obligations with respect to any Business
Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, and (iii) subject to
Section 2.03(d), any liabilities or obligations with respect to Transferred
Employees under the Employee Plans or the Employee Agreements that arise
following the Closing.

  

(iv) Subject to Applicable Law, Seller shall permit the Transferred Employees
who are participants in Sellers SERP Profit Sharing Plan and 401(k) Plan to
make direct "roll-overs" of their plan accounts to a designated Buyer tax
qualified retirement plan.

  

(v) With respect to Transferred Employees who are employees of the
Transferred Sub, subject to Applicable Law, Buyer shall provide continuity of
comparable benefits coverage for such Transferred Employees, including
contributions to existing employee accounts or to accounts established by
Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to identify all amounts relating to
accrued benefits under Employee Plans that are held by third parties, such as
insurance companies and pension funds. To the extent that such amounts held
by third parties are less than the Liabilities of the Employee Plans to which
they relate for such Transferred Employees, Seller shall identify and obtain
an alternative funding mechanism for such Liabilities in compliance with

     

   

Applicable Law. As of the Closing, the Transferred Sub shall employ only
Transferred Employees.

  

### (b) _Additional Employees_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to identify a category of employees of the Selling Parties and make
available for the making of employment offers by Buyer at Closing those
employees of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries whose services would be needed by
Buyer in connection with the Transferred Assets, but who are not listed on
_Schedule 3.14(c)_ , and whom Buyer, in its sole discretion, may choose to
hire, subject to the limitations on provision of information as set forth in
Section 5.14. Any such additional employees who are hired by Buyer at Closing
shall be considered Transferred Employees for purposes of this Agreement.

  

### (c) _Vacation Cash-Outs_. Vacation that has been earned, but not
taken, by a Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date (a) will be paid
by Seller, as required by Applicable Law, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date to Transferred Employees employed in
California or Massachusetts or other jurisdictions where payment is required
under Applicable Law, and (b) for all other Transferred Employees, will be
credited to the Transferred Employee under Buyers vacation policy.

  

### (d) _No Condition_.  Nothing in this Article V shall be construed to
establish or impose a condition to Closing regarding the Business Employees
acceptance of employment with Buyer.

  

## 5.16 _Protection of Privacy_. The data related to customers of the
Business which is included in the Transferred Assets (the " _Customer Data_
") has been collected by the Selling Parties over the internet under the
conditions set forth in the Seller Privacy Policy attached as _Schedule 5.16_
to this Agreement (the " _Privacy Policy_ ") and is transferred to Buyer
and/or Buyer Designees subject to the obligations set forth in the Privacy
Policy.  Buyer covenants and agrees that it will not use, and will cause
each Buyer Designee not to use, the Customer Data in any manner that
conflicts with the terms of the Privacy Policy.

  

## 5.17 _Cash Consideration_. Buyer shall maintain sufficient cash, available
lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
payment of the Cash Consideration to Seller or the Subsidiary Sellers.

  

## 5.18 _Stock Consideration_.

  

### (a) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall complete the filing of any required
notification form for the listing of additional shares or similar application
with Nasdaq or such other national exchange on which the Buyer Common Stock
is quoted or listed for the issuance of the Stock Consideration.

  

### (b) Buyer agrees that it shall, promptly after the Registration Statement
(as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) has been declared
effective, deliver to its transfer agent a letter of instruction as necessary
such that (subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement) at any
time the Registration Statement is effective, the Stock Consideration may be
sold pursuant to the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement. In
addition, the legend set forth in Section 3.21 shall be removed and Buyer
shall issue (or instruct the transfer agent to issue) a certificate without
such legend to the holder of any Stock Consideration upon which it is
stamped, if, unless otherwise

     

   

### required by state securities laws, (a) such holder provides Buyer with an
opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such
Stock Consideration may be made without registration under the Securities
Act; or (b) such holder provides Buyer with reasonable assurances
reasonably acceptable to Buyer that such Stock Consideration can be sold
under Rule 144(k).

  

## 5.19 _Release of Liens_. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) and Share Encumbrances recorded against or otherwise
respecting the Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Transferred Shares
to be satisfied and released in full and shall cause the holders of such
Liens and Share Encumbrances to file all documents and make all filings in
all relevant jurisdictions necessary to release such Liens and Share
Encumbrances.  All such releases, filings and documentation shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  

## 5.20 _Exclusive Dealing_. From and after the date hereof to the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII, neither Seller, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their
respective officers, directors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers,
advisors and other agents shall, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or
encourage inquiries or proposals, participate in any negotiations, or
cooperate in any manner relating to the possible acquisition of the Business
or of all or a material portion of the following, taken as a whole, to anyone
other than Buyer or a Buyer Designee (a " _Sale_ "): (a) Transferred Sub, (b)
Transferred Assets and (c) Excluded Assets which are Intellectual Property
contemplated to be licensed to Buyer pursuant to an Intellectual Property
Agreement except (1) where Seller retains a license with rights to sublicense
such Intellectual Property or (2) for transfers and licenses by a Selling
Party in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (ii)
provide information with respect to the Transferred Assets, Transferred Sub
or the Business to any Person other than Buyer and its agents and
representatives relating to a Sale; (iii) otherwise cooperate
with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any Person with regard
to a Sale; or (iv) enter into any agreement with any Person providing for
a Sale. For sake of clarification, nothing in this Section 5.20 shall
prevent discussion by Seller or its Subsidiaries with third parties as
otherwise permitted hereunder in connection with the completion of the

contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement for a period beginning on the date hereof and ending at 5:00 p.m.,
California time, on the date that is twelve (12) months **** after the
Closing Date; ****_provided, however_ , __ that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.12 and Section 3.23(e) shall not survive

expiration of such representation or warranty, such representation
or warranty shall be deemed to be of no further force or effect, as if never
made, and no action (other than for fraud) may be brought based on the same,
whether for indemnification, breach of contract, tort or under any other
legal theory. All covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement shall survive indefinitely to the extent necessary to give effect
to their terms.

  

## 7.02 _Indemnification_.

  

### (a) _Indemnification Provisions for Buyer_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.01, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates,

Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Seller from and
against and in respect of any and all Losses (as defined below) incurred by
any Buyer Indemnitee resulting from:

   

52   

 

  



  

#### (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Sellers representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or any Conveyance Document and
supplements or modifications to Sellers representations or warranties as
provided in Section 5.02(a);

  

#### (ii) any misrepresentation contained in any certificate furnished to
Buyer by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

  

#### (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any Conveyance Document;

  

#### (iv) any failure of any Selling Party to satisfy any Excluded
Liabilities or other Liabilities of any Selling Party (other than Assumed
Liabilities) arising from the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing;
and

  

#### (v) any expenses required to be paid by Seller under this Agreement or
any Conveyance Document.

  

### (b) _Indemnification Provisions for Seller_. Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.01, from and after the Closing Date, the Selling Parties and
their Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives and
agents (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Buyer from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
(as defined below) incurred by any Seller Indemnitee, resulting from:

  

#### (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Buyers representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or any Conveyance Document and
supplements or modifications to Buyers representations or warranties as
provided in Section 5.02(a);

  

#### (ii) any misrepresentation contained in any certificate furnished to
Seller by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

  

#### (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any Conveyance Document;

  

#### (iv) any failure of Buyer or any Buyer Designee to satisfy any Assumed
Liabilities and any Liabilities (other than the Excluded Liabilities) arising
from or relating to the Transferred Assets or Transferred Sub to the extent
arising subsequent to the Closing; and

  

#### (v) any expenses required to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement or
any Conveyance Document.

  

### (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Indemnitee_ " shall mean
either a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, and the
term " _Indemnitor_ " shall mean either Buyer Indemnitor or a Seller
Indemnitor, as the case may be.

  

### (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term, " _Losses_ " means any and
all deficiencies, judgments, settlements, demands, claims, suits, actions or
causes of action, assessments, liabilities, losses, damages (excluding
indirect, incidental or consequential damages), interest, fines, penalties,

     

   



  

### costs and expenses (including reasonable legal, accounting and
other costs and expenses) incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, settling or satisfying any and all demands, claims, actions,
causes of action, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments or appeals, and
in seeking indemnification therefor.

  

### (e) No Indemnitee(s) shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
covered by Sections 7.02(a)(i)-(ii) or 7.02(b)(i)-(ii) until the aggregate
amount of all such Losses of such Indemnitees shall exceed One Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Basket_ "), at which time all
such Losses incurred in excess of the Basket shall be subject to
indemnification by the relevant Indemnitor hereunder.  The Basket shall not
apply to Losses covered by Sections 7.02(a)(iii)-(v) or Sections
7.02(b)(iii)-(v) or that result from fraud.

  

### (f) The amount of any Losses otherwise recoverable under this Section
7.02 shall be reduced by any amounts that the Indemnitees are entitled to
receive under insurance policies, the Parties hereby acknowledging and
agreeing that prior to seeking reimbursement for any Indemnification Claim
(but not with respect to issuing a Notice of Claim), the Indemnitee must
first seek reimbursement for any and all Losses from any applicable insurance
coverage (and that any compensation provided under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement is not to be deemed insurance for any purpose).

  

## 7.03 _Manner of Indemnification_.

  

### (a) Each indemnification claim shall be made only in accordance with
this Article VII.

  

### (b) If an Indemnitee wishes to make a claim for Losses under Article VII
of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall deliver a written notice (a " _Notice of
Claim_ ") to the applicable Indemnitor promptly after becoming aware of the
facts giving rise to such claim. The Notice of Claim shall (i) specify in
reasonable detail the nature of the claim being made, and (ii) state the
aggregate dollar amount of such claim; _provided, however,_ that the failure
to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of liability under
this Article VII unless (and only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced thereby, and _provided, further,_ notwithstanding
the foregoing, that any Notice of Claim must be delivered prior to expiration
of the survival period specified in Section 7.01.

  

### (c) Following receipt by Indemnitor of a Notice of Claim, the Parties
shall promptly meet to agree on the rights of the respective Parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Parties should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties and
amounts agreed upon shall be promptly paid. Any unresolved dispute between the
Parties shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.11 and Section 9.12
and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement.

  

## 7.04 _Third-Party Claims_. If Buyer becomes aware of a claim of a third
party (including for all purposes of this Section 7.04, any Governmental
Authority) that Buyer believes, in good faith, may result in a claim by it or
any other Buyer Indemnitee against Seller, Buyer shall notify Seller of such
claim as promptly as practicable, _provided_ that any failure to provide such
notice shall not relieve Seller from its obligations under this Article VII
except to the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced thereby.  Seller
shall have the right to assume and conduct the defense of such claim. Seller
shall conduct such defense in a commercially reasonable manner, and shall be

     

   



  

authorized to settle any such claim without the consent of Buyer, _provided,
however_ , that without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld): (a) Seller shall not be authorized to encumber any
assets of Buyer (including the Transferred Assets or Transferred Shares or
assets related exclusively to the Business of Transferred Sub) or agree to
any restriction that would apply to Buyer or the conduct of Buyers business;
(b) Seller shall have paid or caused to be paid any amounts arising out of
such settlement; and (c) a condition to any such settlement shall be a
complete release of Buyer Indemnitees with respect to such third party claim.
Buyer or other applicable Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate
in (but, subject to the succeeding sentence, not control) the defense of any
third party claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_
, that Seller shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
one (1) firm of outside counsel (and not any fees and expenses allocated
to any internal counsel) employed by the Buyer Indemnitees for any period
during which Seller has not assumed the defense thereof following the date
which is ten (10) days after delivery of such notice (other than during any
period in which Buyer shall have failed to give notice of the third party
claim) or to the extent that counsel to the Buyer Indemnitee concludes that
representation of such Indemnitee by the counsel retained by Seller would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between the
Seller and any other party represented by such counsel in such Proceeding.
Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller in the defense of any third party
claim. If Seller does not assume the defense of any third party claim in
accordance with the provisions hereof, Buyer may defend such third party
claim in a commercially reasonable manner and may settle such third party
claim after giving written notice of the terms thereof to Seller.

  

## 7.05 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except with respect to fraud by Buyer or Seller or
as provided in Section 5.09(b) through Section 5.09(k), as the case may be,
the provisions of this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any monetary damages of the Indemnitees from and after the Closing Date for
any Losses arising under this Agreement or any Conveyance Document or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including claims
of breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or
any Conveyance Document; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing clause of
this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief but shall be deemed a waiver of any
rights of rescission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
except as provided in Section 5.09, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller
to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VII or otherwise under this
Agreement, Applicable Law or otherwise shall be limited to Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "), it being
understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that Liabilities that
Seller or its Subsidiaries are required to pay or satisfy (or for which
Seller and its Subsidiaries are otherwise responsible) under Section 5.09 are
not subject to any limitation, whether under the Indemnification Cap or
otherwise, and shall not be counted against the Indemnification Cap. Nothing
in this Agreement limits or otherwise affects in any way the rights and
remedies of either Party with respect to causes of action arising under any
Ancillary Agreement, or any rights and remedies of Seller or Buyer with
respect to any infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property
of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be (including any right of Seller or
Buyer to seek equitable or injunctive relief in connection therewith), all of
which rights and remedies are expressly reserved.

     

   



  

## 7.06 _Subrogation_. If the Indemnitor makes any payment under this Article
VII in respect of any Losses, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to the rights of the Indemnitee against any insurer
or third party with respect to such Losses; _provided, however_ , that the
Indemnitor shall not have any rights of subrogation with respect to the other
Party hereto or any of its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates
officers, directors, agents or employees.

  

## 7.07 _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement or any other Acquisition Document, no Party (or its Affiliates)
shall, in any event, be liable to the other Party (or its Affiliates) for any
consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of revenue or
income, cost of capital, or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement. Each Party agrees
that it will not seek punitive damages as to any matter under, relating to or
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Acquisition Documents.

business on March 31, 2007 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any Party whose failure
to fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
prior to the aforesaid date _provided, further_ , that if the sole condition
to Closing in Article VI that remains unsatisfied (or waived by Buyer) as of
the aforesaid date is set forth in Section 6.01(f) (apart from delivery of
Acquisition Documents contemplated to be delivered at Closing), then either
Party may, in its sole discretion and upon written notice to the other Party,
extend the aforesaid date to a date no later than July 31, 2007 (and in such
event, all references herein to the Termination Date shall be to such date as
so extended);

  

#### (ii) any Applicable Law shall be enacted or become applicable that makes
the transactions contemplated hereby or the consummation of the Closing
illegal or otherwise prohibited;

  

#### (iii) any judgment, injunction, order or decree enjoining either Party
hereto from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby is entered, and
such judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become final and
nonappealable; or

  

#### (iv) the other Party is in material breach or material default of any
covenant or agreement contained herein required to be performed or satisfied,
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or 6.02, as applicable,
shall not be capable of being satisfied on or prior to the

     

   



  

#### Closing Date, and such breach or default shall not be cured or
waived within ten (10) Business Days after written notice is delivered by
the non-breaching Party specifying, in reasonable detail, such claimed
material breach or default and demanding its cure or satisfaction; _provided_
that if it is not reasonably practicable to cure such breach or default
within ten (10) Business Days but such breaching Party is using its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly cure, then such Party shall have
an additional ten (10) Business Days to cure the breach.

  

### (c) by written notice from Seller prior to Closing, in its sole and
absolute discretion, given not more than twenty (20) calendar days after
receiving notice of a Change of Control of Buyer (from Buyer or otherwise).

  

## 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01, all obligations of the Parties hereunder (except for this
Section 8.02, Section 5.01(a) (as to confidentiality), Section 5.08 (Public
Announcements), Section 9.01 (Notices), Section 9.03 (Expenses), Section 9.05
(Governing Law) and Section 9.11 (Dispute Resolution)) shall terminate
without Liability of any Party to any other Party, the representations and
warranties made herein shall not survive beyond a termination of this
Agreement and no Party shall have any Liability for breach of any
representation or warranty upon a termination of this Agreement prior to the
Closing. Nothing contained in this Section 8.02 shall relieve any Party of
Liability for any breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement that
occurred prior to the date of termination of this Agreement.

amendment, by all Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

     

   



  

### (b) No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of a
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
a warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent occurrence. No failure or delay by a Party
hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude

independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there

Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that
the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.

  

## 9.11 _Dispute Resolution_.

  

## (a) All disputes arising directly under the express terms of this
Agreement, including the grounds for termination hereof, shall be resolved as

dispute resolution and specify therein the scope of the dispute. Within
thirty (30) days after such written notification, the Parties agree to meet
for one (1) day with an impartial mediator and consider dispute resolution
alternatives other than litigation. If an alternative method of dispute
resolution is not agreed upon within thirty (30) days after the one (1) day
mediation, either Party may begin litigation proceedings.

have the right at any time to seek preliminary injunctive or other equitable
relief in any proper court.

of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such a Delaware state or Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the Person of such Parties and over
the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.01 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

  

### (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court located in the State
of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

### (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

  

## 9.13 _Notice of Change of Control_. Promptly upon the earliest of Buyers
approving or entering into any transaction constituting a Change of Control
or an announcement by Buyer or any

     

   



  

## other Person of a Change of Control of Buyer, Buyer shall give
Seller written notice thereof, describing in reasonable detail the applicable
Change of Control and identifying each "person" or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, "group" (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the
Exchange Act) that is a party to such transaction or transactions.

  

## 9.14 _Meaning of Include and Including_. Whenever in this Agreement the
word " _include_ " or " _including_ " is used, it shall be deemed to mean "
_include, without limitation_ " or " _including, without limitation_ ," as
the case may be, and the language following " _include_ " or " _including_ "
shall not be deemed to set forth an exhaustive list.

  

## 9.15 _Knowledge of Breach; Schedules_. No fact, event, misrepresentation
or occurrence that, in the absence of this Section 9.15, would constitute a
breach or breaches of any representation or warranty of a Party under this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a breach or breaches by such Party of
its representations or warranties under this Agreement if the officers,
directors or employees of the other Party familiar with the execution of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have actual knowledge of such
breach or breaches on the date hereof and/or as of the Closing Date,
excluding, for these purposes, any Knowledge resulting from disclosures made
in any of the schedules hereto by the other Party pursuant to Section 5.02,
except as to which the officers, directors or employees of the non-disclosing
Party familiar with the execution of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement had actual knowledge prior to such disclosure pursuant to Section
5.02. The disclosure of any information on any of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or any of the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, shall be
deemed to constitute the disclosure of such information on all of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or all of the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, respectively,
applicable to such information.

  

## 9.16 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any
employee or former employee of Seller or any Affiliate thereof (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), except as specifically provided, following
the Closing, in Article VII.

  

## 9.17 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, may cause
irreparable injury to the other Party, for which damages, even if available,
may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby consents to
the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel performance of such Partys obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder.

  

## 9.18 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Buyer and Seller
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Acquisition
Documents. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against
the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.
