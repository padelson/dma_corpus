AMALGAMATION     This Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of September 5, 2000, by and among
Numerical Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Numerical
Nova Scotia Company, a Nova Scotia unlimited liability company and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Numerical ULC"), Numerical Acquisition Limited,
a Nova Scotia limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Numerical ULC ("Amalgamation Sub"), Cadabra Design Automation, Inc., a Nova
Scotia limited liability company (the "Company"), 3047725 Nova Scotia
Limited, a Nova Scotia limited liability company ("ML Holdco"), Martin
Lefebvre, an individual, and Faysal Sohail, an individual.   RECITALS   A.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) (the "Companies Act"),
Parent, Amalgamation Sub, the Company and ML Holdco intend to enter into a
business combination transaction.   B. The Board of Directors of the
Company (i) has determined that the Amalgamation (as defined herein) is
consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of the
Company and is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) has determined
to recommend that the shareholders of the Company adopt and approve this
Agreement and approve the Amalgamation.   C. The Board of Directors of
Parent have approved this Agreement, the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement   D. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company
holding in the aggregate approximately seventy-six percent (76%) of the
Company\'s outstanding shares of capital stock are entering into Voting
Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A 
--------- (the "Voting Agreements").   E. As a condition to the Closing,
Parent shall provide to the Company shareholders certain rights with respect
to the registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), of the resale of the Parent common stock issuable upon the
exchange of shares of Amalco issued to such shareholders, on the terms set
forth in a registration rights agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Registration Rights  --------- Agreement").   F.
As a condition to the Closing and an inducement to the Parent to enter into
this Agreement, (1) Martin Lefebvre and Faysal Sohail shall enter
into employment agreements in substantially the form attached as Exhibits C
and D  ---------- - hereto, respectively (the "Management Employment
Agreements") and (2) the persons identified on Exhibit E (the "Key
Employees")  ---------   shall enter into employment and noncompetition
agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the
"Employment Agreements").  ---------   G. The parties intend, by executing
this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). The parties intend that the Amalgamation shall also constitute
a tax-deferred transfer in accordance with the provisions of Section 87 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the "ITA"). The subsequent reorganization of the
Amalco Class A Shares into Exchangeable Shares shall qualify as a tax
deferred reorganization in accordance with the provisions of Section 86 of
the ITA.   H. The parties intend that the Amalgamation shall qualify for
accounting treatment under United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("U.S. GAAP") as a purchase.   I. Capitalized terms used herein,
if not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings given to them in Article X
below.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, intending to be legally bound hereby the parties agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE AMALGAMATION   1.1 The Amalgamation. At the
Effective Time, and subject to and upon the  ---------------- terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Agreement of Amalgamation to be filed
pursuant to Section 1.2, and the applicable provisions of the Companies Act,
the Company, ML Holdco and Amalgamation Sub shall be amalgamated to form
a new Nova Scotia corporation ("Amalco"), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, ML Holdco and Amalgamation Sub shall cease (the
"Amalgamation").   1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, the  ----------------------- parties hereto shall cause the
Amalgamation to be consummated by obtaining an order under the Companies Act
from the appropriate Nova Scotia court (the "Amalgamation Order") and by
filing the Amalgamation Order and the Agreement of Amalgamation substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K with the Nova Scotia Registrar of
Joint Stock Companies (the time of such filing being the "Effective Time").
The closing of the Amalgamation (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, at the
Effective Time after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, or at such other time, date and location as the parties
hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). The parties shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Closing Date to occur on September
29, 2000.   1.3 Effect of the Amalgamation. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the  -------------------------- Amalgamation shall be as provided
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property,   -2-   rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Amalgamation Sub, the Company and ML Holdco shall vest in
Amalco, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and ML Holdco
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of Amalco.   1.4 Memorandum
of Association and Articles of Association. The Memorandum of 
----------------------------------------------------- Association and
Articles of Association of Amalco (the "Amalco Charter Documents") shall be
the same in form and substance as the Memorandum of Association and Articles
of Association of Amalgamation Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the Amalco Charter Documents shall reflect that
the corporate name of Amalco shall be the corporate name of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Date. The authorized capital of Amalco
shall consist of a limited number of common shares (the "Amalco Common
Shares"), a limited number of Class A preferred shares, without nominal or
par value (the "Amalco Class A Shares"), and a limited number of exchangeable
shares without nominal or par value (the "Exchangeable Shares"), such
Exchangeable Shares having the rights, privileges, restrictions
and conditions as set forth in substantially the form attached as Exhibit I
(the  --------- "Exchangeable Share Provisions").   1.5 Directors and
Officers. The initial directors of Amalco shall be 
---------------------- appointed by Parent. The initial officers of Amalco
shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this  ----------------------- Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of Parent, Amalgamation
Sub, the Company, ML Holdco or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:   (a) Company Capital Stock. Each
Company Common Share, Company Class A  --------------------- Share and
Company Class B Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares held of
record by ML Holdco, shall be automatically converted into 0.1745 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of an Amalco Class A Share. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, all shares of Company Capital Stock
held by ML Holdco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Amalgamation, be automatically canceled and shall cease to be
outstanding, and ML Holdco shall not be entitled to any Amalco Class A
Shares, Exchangeable Shares or Parent Common Stock on account of the shares
of Company Capital Stock so held.   (b) Company Stock Options. At the
Effective Time, all Company Stock  --------------------- Options then
outstanding under Company\'s Canadian Option Plan and U.S. Option Plan, and
the Canadian Option Plan and U.S. Option Plan themselves, shall be assumed by
Amalco in accordance with Section 6.3.   (c) ML Holdco Capital Stock.
Pursuant to the Amalgamation, the  ----------------------- capital stock of
ML Holdco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into a number of Amalco Class A Shares equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by ML
Holdco immediately prior to the Effective Time times the Exchange 
----- Ratio, which Amalco Class A Shares shall be allocated between the
common shares and   -3-   the preferred shares of ML Holdco in a manner
which gives effect to the relative values of the common shares and preferred
shares of ML Holdco (based upon (i) the redemption price of the preferred
shares of ML Holdco, (ii) the noon Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate
announced by the Bank of Canada on the fifth Business Day prior to the
Effective Date and (iii) the weighted average closing price of the Parent
Common Stock on Nasdaq on the five trading days ending on the fifth trading
day prior to the Effective Date).   (d) Capital Stock of Amalgamation Sub.
Each share of capital stock of 
--------------------------------- Amalgamation Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one common
share of Amalco. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of
Amalgamation Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of
capital stock of Amalco.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. Between the
date of this Agreement  ----------------------------- and the Closing, the
Exchange Ratio will be immediately adjusted by Parent to reflect
proportionately and equitably the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or
other change affecting the Parent Common Stock as a class.   (f) Fractional
Shares. No fractional shares of Amalco Class A Shares 
----------------- shall be issued by Amalco pursuant to the Amalgamation.
Instead, all Exchangeable Shares to which any Person would be entitled
pursuant to this Agreement shall be aggregated, and such shareholder shall
receive that number of Exchangeable Shares equal to the nearest whole number
of shares.   1.7 Dissenting Shares.  -----------------   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the shares
("Dissenting Shares") of any holder of Company Capital Stock that
has demanded and perfected appraisal and dissenters\' rights for such shares
in accordance with the Companies Act ("Dissenters\' Rights") and who, as of
the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal
rights, shall not be converted into Amalco Class A Shares pursuant to Section
1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
granted by the Companies Act.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection (a), if any holder of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal
of such shares under the Companies Act shall effectively withdraw (or
otherwise by law not be entitled to) the right to appraisal, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s
shares shall automatically be converted into Amalco Class A Shares as set
forth in Section 1.6, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares.   (c) The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company which relate
to any such demand for appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time
with respect to demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily  
-4-   make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company
Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   1.8
Surrender of Certificates.  -------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select  -------------- a Person
reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") in the Amalgamation.   (b) Surviving Corporation to Provide
Exchangeable Shares. Promptly 
---------------------------------------------------- after the Effective
Time, Amalco shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, the Amalco Class A Shares issuable in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and ML Holdco
Stock pursuant to Sections 1.6(a) and (c), respectively.   (c) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective 
------------------- Time and in any event on or before the fifth (5/th/) day
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Amalco Class A
Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 1.6. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of
whole Amalco Class A Shares into which their shares of Company Capital Stock
or ML Holdco Capital Stock were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or
(c), respectively, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the ownership of that number
of whole Amalco Class A Shares into which such shares of Company Capital
Stock or ML Holdco Capital Stock shall have been so converted (including any
voting, notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such Amalco
Class A Shares under the Amalco Charter Documents or under the Companies
Act).   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends or 
------------------------------------------------ other distributions declared
or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Amalco Class A
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates when the holders of record of such
Certificates surrender such Certificates.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If
certificates representing Amalco Class  ---------------------- A Shares are
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting
such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes   -5-   required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing Amalco Class A Shares in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or (ii) established
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) Required Withholding. Each
of the Exchange Agent, Parent and  -------------------- Amalco shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco Capital Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or other
U.S. federal or state law, the ITA or other Canadian federal or provincial
law, or any other state, local or foreign law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this  ------------ Section 1.8, neither the Exchange Agent,
Parent, Amalco nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock, ML Holdco Capital Stock, Amalco Class A Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.9 No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All Amalco Class A 
--------------------------------------------------- Shares issued in exchange
for shares of Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco Stock.
There shall be no registration of transfers on the records of Amalco of
shares of Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Amalco for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.10 Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any 
-------------------------------------- Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the Amalco
Class A Shares into which the shares of Company Capital Stock or ML Holdco
Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.6; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent, may, in its  --------
------- discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing Amalco Class A Shares, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, Amalco or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.11 Tax and Accounting
Treatment.  ----------------------------   (a) The business combination to
be effected by the Amalgamation is intended to be treated as a purchase for
accounting purposes. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to
adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code
and that the   -6-   Amalgamation and immediate reorganization of capital
referred to in Section 1.12 will constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(C) of the Code involving a transfer of
substantially all of the assets of the Company and ML Holdco, respectively,
in exchange for the Exchangeable Shares, which the parties intend to be
tantamount to Parent Common Stock for United States federal income tax
purposes. The parties intend that the Amalgamation and the
subsequent reorganization of capital shall also constitute tax-deferred
transactions in accordance with the provisions of Sections 87 and 86 of the
ITA, respectively.   1.12 Reorganization of Capital. 
-------------------------   As soon as reasonably practicable after the
effectiveness of the Amalgamation, and in any event on the same day as the
Amalgamation occurs, Amalco shall reorganize its capital pursuant to Section
86 of the ITA so that all of the Class A Shares are exchanged for
Exchangeable Shares of Amalco.   1.13 Reservation of Parent Common Stock. 
----------------------------------   On or before the Effective Time, Parent
shall reserve for issuance pursuant to the terms of this Agreement 3,200,000
shares of Parent Common Stock.   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the Circular prepared and
completed as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
and to cause the Circular to be mailed to the Company Shareholders as soon as
practicable upon the completion of the preparation of the Circular. Each of
Parent and the Company shall provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the
reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Circular, or in any amendments or
supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with
the other\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Circular. Each of
Parent, the Company, and ML Holdco shall make such representations as may be
reasonably requested by their respective counsel in connection with
preparation of the Circular. As promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, each of the Company, ML Holdco, Parent and Amalgamation Sub
will prepare and file any filings required to be filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of the Companies Act, the Canadian Securities Legislation, and
any other Canadian, United States or other laws relating to the Amalgamation
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   -36-    (b)
Recommendation of Company Board of Directors. The Circular shall 
-------------------------------------------- include a statement to the
effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously recommended
that Company\'s shareholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the
Amalgamation at the Company Shareholders Meeting.   (c) Company Shareholders
Meeting. As soon as practicable after the 
---------------------------- execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
take all actions required pursuant to the Companies Act, the Canadian
Securities Legislation (and all other applicable securities laws) and the
Company Charter Documents to convene the Company Shareholders Meeting, which
shall be held as soon as practicable, and in any event the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to convene such meeting not later than
September 29, 2000, for the purpose of voting upon the Amalgamation. The
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
shareholders proxies or powers of attorney in favor of the approval of the
Amalgamation and will take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable
to secure the vote or consent of its shareholders required by the Companies
Act and all other applicable laws to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Circular is provided
to the Company\'s shareholders in advance of a vote on the Amalgamation or,
if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Circular) there are insufficient shares of
Company Capital Stock represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall call, notice, convene, hold
and conduct, and solicit proxies in connection with the Company Shareholders
Meeting in compliance in all material respects with the Companies Act, the

this Agreement shall constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 144"). Pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, Parent shall grant to each holder of
Exchangeable Shares certain rights with respect to the registration under the
Securities Act of the resale by such holder of the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in exchange for such holder\'s Exchangeable Shares. Except as
otherwise provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, the certificates
representing securities issued in by Parent and Amalco in connection with
this Agreement shall bear appropriate legends to identify such privately
placed shares as being restricted under the Securities Act.   6.3
Assumption of Company Stock Options by Amalco. 
---------------------------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time,
Amalco shall succeed to and assume each outstanding Company Stock Option, and
each such outstanding Company Stock Option shall be converted into an option
to purchase from Amalco a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the number of Company Common Shares issuable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option times the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at
an exercise price equal to the exercise price of such Company Stock option
divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest cent). As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Amalco shall deliver to each holder of
Company   -37-   Stock Options appropriate notice or substitution
agreements setting forth such option holder\'s rights pursuant hereto, which
rights shall be the same as such holder\'s rights prior to the Closing,
except that the Company Stock Options shall be converted into options to
purchase Parent Common Stock as described above. It is the intention of
Parent and the Company that the Company Stock Options so assumed shall
continue to qualify, following the Closing, as incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Code to the same extent those options qualified for such
incentive stock option treatment immediately prior to the Closing.   (b)
Prior to the Effective Time, Amalgamation Sub shall purchase from Parent and
Parent shall sell to Amalgamation Sub, 528,762 newly issued shares of Parent
Common Stock (the "Option Reserve Shares") to enable Amalco to satisfy all
exercises of Company Stock Options after the Effective Time. Amalgamation Sub
shall purchase and Parent shall sell the Option Reserve Shares for
an aggregate purchase price equal to the aggregate exercise price (the
"Reserve Share Purchase Price") of the Company Stock Options, whether vested
or unvested, which are outstanding at the Effective Time (the "Assumed
Options"). Amalgamation Sub shall pay the Reserve Share Purchase Price to
Parent in the following manner: (i) the aggregate par value of the Option
Reserve Shares shall be paid in cash; and (ii) the balance of the Reserve
Share Purchase Price shall be paid in the form of a non-interest bearing
note, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L, from
Amalgamation Sub to Parent (the "Note"). The principal amount of the Note
shall be repaid to Parent by Amalgamation Sub from time to time solely from
the proceeds received by Amalco after the Effective Time from holders of
Assumed Options upon exercise of their respective Assumed Options. Amalco
shall remit to Parent such proceeds from exercise of the Assumed Options from
time to time until such time as the principal amount of the Note is fully
repaid.   (c) From and after the purchase of the Option Reserve Shares
by Amalgamation Sub pursuant to Section 6.3(a) above until the earlier of
the exercise of all then-outstanding Assumed Options or the cancellation of
such Assumed Options in accordance with their terms, the Option Reserve

defined in the Escrow Agreement).   (iii) Each Company Shareholder hereby
waives any and all defenses which may be available to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Shareholder Representative taken in good faith
under the Escrow Agreement.   (iv) Notwithstanding the power of attorney

assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or
any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Shareholder Representative
is authorized, in his sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and
comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which he is advised by
legal counsel selected by him is binding upon him without the need for appeal
or other action; and if the Shareholder Representative complies with any such
order, writ, judgment or decree, he shall not be liable to any Company
Shareholder or to any other Person by reason of such compliance even though
such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.   (h) Removal of Shareholder
Representative; Authority of Successor

Representative appointed in such writing that he or she accepts the
responsibility of successor Shareholder Representative and agrees to perform

-----------   (a) If the Shareholder Representative delivers to Parent and
the Escrow Agent a timely notice pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Escrow
Agreement disputing in good faith the amount of any claim or that any claim
is covered hereby or if any other dispute, claim or controversy ("Dispute")
arises with respect to this Agreement, then the Parties hereto agree to
resolve such Dispute in accordance with the arbitration provisions
hereinafter set forth. The party alleging any claim hereunder (the
"Claimant") shall issue a notice (the "Dispute Notice") to each of the other
parties hereto in accordance with the notice provisions hereof. The Dispute
Notice will set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the Claimant\'s claim
("Claim") and shall be deemed notice of the Claimant\'s election to assert
its right to arbitration as herein provided. If the Dispute is resolved, then
the disputants shall execute a memorandum setting forth such resolution and,
if applicable, the amount of any damages payable to Claimant, and shall
furnish such memorandum to all parties to this Agreement. If after a period
of ten (10) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice (the "Mediation Period")
the parties are unable to resolve their differences, the parties agree to
arbitrate their differences in the City of Santa Clara, California
in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
then obtaining (except to the extent modified hereby) before a panel of
three arbitrators (the "Arbitrators"). The indemnifying party shall select
one arbitrator and the Claimant, or if there are more than one Claimant
asserting the same Claim, a majority of the Claimants, shall select one
arbitrator. Each of the parties shall each make their selection of an
arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the Mediation
Period (the "Arbitrator   -54-   Selection Period"). The two arbitrators
shall select a third arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the expiration
of the Arbitrator Selection Period and upon his selection, the third
arbitrator shall act as the Chair of all proceedings under the arbitration.
In the event the two arbitrators fail to select the third arbitrator within
such fifteen (15) day period, either party may apply to a California Court of
general jurisdiction sitting in Santa Clara County to have such Court appoint
such third arbitrator.   (b) With respect to all pre-hearing matters, the
arbitration shall be governed by the California Code of Civil Procedure (the
"CCP") and the parties shall be deemed to have all of the rights and
responsibilities as are provided for therein. In connection therewith, to the
extent permitted by law, the Arbitrators shall be vested with such authority
and discretion as if they were presiding as a California State Court Judge
and as if this were a civil action pending before him. This shall include,
inter alia, the authority to entertain  ----- ---- and decide dispositive
motions under the CCP; provided, however, nothing in the foregoing shall
entitle the Arbitrators to amend the express terms of the Agreement.   (c)
Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys\' fees in connection with
the arbitration, subject to the opinion of the Arbitrators. Such costs
and fees incurred by the Shareholder Representative shall be satisfied from
the Indemnification Escrow Account through cash available thereunder and the
sale of the shares held therein.   (d) As soon as Arbitrators have been
appointed, the parties shall have the right to commence and conduct discovery
pursuant to all means available under the CCP. The parties agree that each
side will be limited to three (3) depositions. In addition, each party may
depose the other parties\' designated expert(s). The Arbitrators shall have
the power to limit discovery which they deem not to be in compliance with the
CCP.   (e) All discovery requests shall be made within thirty (30) days
after appointment of the Arbitrators, and all responses thereto shall be made
and all documents, information and witnesses shall be provided or made
available within ten (10) days after service of the applicable discovery
request, unless the Arbitrators shall order longer periods. The matter shall
be set for hearing on a date as soon as practical but no later than thirty
(30) days after the completion of discovery. The hearing shall be completed
as quickly as possible and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
first day of the hearing. The Arbitrators\' award (the "Arbitral Award")
shall be rendered in writing within thirty (30) days of the completion of the
hearing on the merits. Any delays in the foregoing schedule shall not
prejudice the rights of the parties.   (f) The Arbitral Award shall be final
and conclusive on the parties.   (g) In the event that one or more of the
Arbitrators named above refuse to act, or become incapable, incompetent or
unfit to act before the hearing on the merits has been completed or before an
award has been entered, a successor arbitrator shall be appointed by
agreement of the parties or by application by either party to a California
Court of general jurisdiction sitting in Santa Clara County.   -55-   
(h) The Arbitrators shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and by and apply the substantive law of the State
of California in making their award. Any dispute arising between the parties
during the course of the arbitration concerning the interpretation and
enforcement of these arbitration provisions shall be resolved by the
Arbitrators in accordance with the provisions hereof.   (i) At the request
of either party, the arbitration proceedings pursuant hereto will be
conducted confidentially. In such case all documents, testimony and records
shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrator in confidence under
seal, available for inspection only by the arbitrator, the parties and their
respective attorneys and their respective experts, who shall agree in advance
and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain
such information in confidence.   10.9 Rules of Construction. The parties
hereto agree that they have been  --------------------- represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

-------------------- damage would occur in the event that any of the

specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
