  Consents to Transfer of Leased Properties. Except as otherwise set forth
  herein, the Seller will have no obligation to obtain any consent in connection
  with the assignment of any of the Leases. If a Lease to be assigned to the
  Buyer pursuant to this Agreement requires, either expressly or by law, the
  affirmative consent of the landlord under such Lease to legally effectuate an
  assignment thereof, then the Seller will request such landlord&#146;s consent to
  the assignment in writing. If the Seller obtains such consent, the Seller
  shall provide notice thereof to the Buyer. If the Seller has not obtained
  such consent by the date which is fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing
  Date, the Seller will notify the Buyer thereof. In the event the Leased
  Property can be subleased to the Buyer without the consent of the landlord
  (or if the landlord&#146;s right to withhold its consent is absolute in the case
  of assignments but subject to a reasonableness standard in the case of
  subleases), the Seller shall sublease the Leased Property to the Buyer for
  the duration of the lease period, including renewal terms. Only if the Leased
  Property cannot be assigned or subleased to the Buyer as provided herein, the
  Buyer may: (a) after notice to and consent of the Seller, which consent may
  be withheld for any reason whatsoever, use its own efforts to obtain such
  landlord&#146;s consent to the extent such efforts do not create any additional
  liability to the Seller; (b) enter into a new lease with such landlord
  effective as of Closing Date so long as such landlord agrees to terminate the
  existing lease between such landlord and the Seller, and such landlord
  releases the Seller, effective as of the Closing Date, from any liability
  under such existing lease; or (c) remove such Leased Property from this
  Agreement (a &#147;Dropped Leased Property&#148;) and reduce the Purchase Price by the
  amount of the Purchase Price allocated to such Leased Property set forth on
  Exhibit C. The Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
  obtain the landlord consents described on Schedule 2.2(b)(iii). The Seller
  shall request and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain estoppel
  certificates with respect to each of the Leases which require landlord to
  deliver such certificates. (c) Personal Property and Equipment. The Seller&#146;s
  conveyance and assignment of its interests in the Purchased Assets pursuant
  to this Agreement will include all of the Seller&#146;s Personal Property and
  Equipment (including all of the Seller&#146;s interest in remediation equipment,
  monitoring wells and Seller&#146;s interest in any Tanks, located above, on or
  under the Properties as of the Closing Date), except as otherwise specified
  within this Agreement. The Personal Property (other than the Tanks) and
  Equipment will be identified on one or more Bills of Sale substantially in
  the form attached hereto as Exhibit H-1 (the &#147;Bill of Sale&#148;). The Seller&#146;s
  interest in the Tanks shall be conveyed to the Buyer pursuant to one or more
  UST Bills of Sale (the &#147;UST Bill of Sale&#148;) substantially in the form attached
  hereto as Exhibit H-2. To the extent possible, Tanks will be identified on a
  UST Bill of Sale by number and size; provided that any Orphaned Tanks,
  whether or not specifically identified, shall convey with the Property. The
  Seller does not assume or retain any liability or responsibility related to
  any Tanks that may be discovered on the Properties following Closing, and
  such responsibility and Liability shall be transferred to and assumed by the
  Buyer as of Closing. </font></p>

  Material Defects, but at the time of Closing such Material Defects have not
  been cured to the Buyer&#146;s reasonable satisfaction, the Buyer&#146;s sole option
  and remedy shall be either to (x) proceed to Closing without any reduction in
  the Purchase Price or (y) remove such Property(ies) with the uncured Material
  Defect from this Agreement, in which case the Closing shall nevertheless
  proceed, except that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of
  the Purchase Price allocated to such Property on Exhibit C, and such Property
  shall no longer be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
  provided, however, the Removal Limit shall not apply to any such Properties
  as to which the Seller elected but failed to cure Material Defects. (c) For
  avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
  this Agreement, provided that the Conditions to Buyer&#146;s Obligation to Close
  (hereinafter defined) are satisfied or waived by the Buyer and the Seller is
  not in material default under this Agreement, in each case beyond all applicable
  notice and cure periods set forth herein, the Buyer shall have no right to

  shall keep the Properties free from any liens or claims arising out of any
  work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or on behalf
  of the Buyer. If any mechanic&#146;s or other lien is recorded against the
  Properties, the Buyer shall pay the lien or post any bond necessary to
  discharge the lien of record within ten (10) days after receiving notice of
  the lien&#146;s recording. 4.7 Failure to Close after Installation of Equipment.
  If the contemplated transaction is not consummated for any reason, and the
  Buyer has installed equipment on the Properties in accordance with Section
  4.6, the Buyer shall, at the Seller&#146;s option: (a) remove the equipment
  installed by the Buyer and restore the Properties to their original condition
  upon ten (10) days&#146; notice from the Seller; or (b) transfer title to any equipment
  installed by the Buyer to the Seller, at no cost and without any express or
  implied warranty, after which the Seller will be solely responsible for such
  equipment. In removing equipment and restoring the Properties to their
  original condition, the Buyer shall make reasonable efforts not to disrupt
  existing operations on the Properties and shall assume all risks involved in
  entering the Properties in connection therewith. 4.8 Casualty. The Seller
  shall keep the Properties insured with such policy types and coverage amounts
  as the Seller maintains in the ordinary course of business until Closing or
  earlier termination of this Agreement. If there is any material damage to or
  destruction of a Property (a &#147;Materially Damaged Property&#148;), the Closing with
  respect to such Materially Damaged Property shall, at the Seller&#146;s sole
  discretion, nevertheless proceed, provided that, unless before Closing the
  same shall have been remedied and restored to substantially the same
  condition as it was on the Effective Date, at the Closing, the Seller shall
  pay over or assign to the Buyer any net insurance proceeds due to the Seller
  as a result of such damage or destruction (without recourse to the Seller)
  and the Buyer shall assume responsibility for such repair and receive a
  credit against the Purchase Price for any applicable policy deductible. 5.

  or equipment noncompliance that may be found as a result of such inspections,
  but shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer&#146;s performance of its obligations
  under this Section 5.1. 5.2 Environmental Assessment. The Seller has made

  and contractors, shall be entitled to enter upon any Property, after not less
  than two (2) business day prior notice to the Seller to perform environmental
  inspections, tests and evaluations of such Property. All such environmental
  and invasive testing shall be performed in coordination with the Seller and
  the Seller&#146;s environmental consultant. The Seller shall be entitled to have a
  representative present during any entry onto the Property by the Buyer or its
  agents to conduct any inspections or tests. The Buyer shall perform all
  inspections and tests in such a manner as to minimize any interference with
  the Seller&#146;s use and operation of a Property. Any studies or tests that, when
  being conducted, cause unreasonable disruption or interference shall be
  halted immediately upon the Seller&#146;s request. At Seller&#146;s request, the Buyer
  shall provide the Seller with copies of any reports, studies or
  investigations prepared by the Buyer or its contractors in connection with
  such inspections at no cost to the Seller. 5.4 No Warranty of the
  Evaluations. The Buyer understands and agrees that the Evaluations were not

  make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the
  Evaluations. 5.5 Independent Verification of the Evaluations. The Buyer
  acknowledges by its consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that
  it had an opportunity to conduct its own independent investigation regarding
  the environmental condition of the Properties and also had the opportunity
  for independent verification of the Evaluations, the environmental conditions
  of the Properties, and any other environmental-related information. 5.6

  Contracts with the Remediation Contractors for the performance of the
  Remediation Activities to be performed at the Properties in order to achieve
  Project Completion. (b) The Seller&#146;s only Liability under this Agreement for
  Environmental Liabilities shall be to cause to be performed the Remediation
  Activities related to Covered Contamination, if any and as set forth in the
  Remediation Contracts between the Effective Date and the Closing Date (the
  &#147;Seller&#146;s Environmental Obligations&#148;). Whether or not Project Completion has
  been or is achieved for any Property prior to Closing, the Seller shall have
  no further responsibility to the Buyer for Environmental Liabilities whatsoever
  for that Property after Closing, and shall have no further obligation to
  enforce the terms of the Remediation Contracts thereafter. From and after the
  Closing Date, the Buyer shall be responsible for causing to be performed the
  Remediation Activities related to Covered Contamination set forth in the
  Remediation Contracts. Achieving Project Completion shall not require full
  remediation of Contamination, but rather written determination by the
  applicable Governmental Entity that NFR Status has been achieved for the
  Property, excluding only post-NFR Status monitoring which may be required in
  certain cases. (c) The Seller will not pay for and has no responsibility for
  Contamination except as set forth Section 5.7(b) above. The Buyer
  specifically acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible at its
  sole cost and expense for, and assumes all Environmental Liabilities and all
  risk associated with, any and all Contamination at, on, under, or migrating
  or originating from the Properties (other than with respect to the Seller&#146;s
  Environmental Obligations). If the Buyer transfers or assigns in part or all
  of its interests in the Properties, the Buyer agrees that such transfer or
  assignment will not release the Buyer from its assumption of Environmental Liabilities
  or its obligations for Remediation Activities. (d) The Buyer agrees that it
  will, where applicable and to the maximum extent possible and permitted under
  Environmental Laws, assist the Seller in seeking and obtaining reimbursement
  for any Remediation Activities paid for by the Seller prior to the Closing
  Date from any Government Reimbursement Fund. The Seller makes no warranties
  or representations concerning the ability of the Buyer or the Seller to
  recover against any Government Reimbursement Fund. (e) The Buyer expressly
  waives any right or claim it has against ExxonMobil and the Seller and the
  Seller Related Parties related to: (i) the selection of the Remediation
  Contractor; and (ii) all work performed by the Remediation Contractor. The
  Buyer agrees that it shall assume, as of the Closing Date, the Seller&#146;s
  obligation to enforce the Remediation Contracts against the Remediation
  Contractor. </font></p>

  operating tanks that are used for fuel storage on operating Properties, and a
  pressure decay test will be used on all Stage II vapor recovery lines.
  Tightness testing will be conducted to detect the presence of leaks in any
  tank and will be completed in compliance with the requirements of the applicable
  Governmental Entity and all applicable laws and regulations. (b) Failing
  Tanks or Lines. If the tightness testing results do not meet the application

  Seller and the Buyer acknowledge that ExxonMobil maintains a worldwide
  program of property and liability insurance coverage for itself and its
  Affiliates, including the Prior Exxon Owners. This program has been designed
  to achieve a coordinated risk-management package for the entire ExxonMobil
  corporate group. The program consists principally of three types of policies:
  (a) policies issued to ExxonMobil or its predecessors; (b) policies issued
  directly to affiliates by one of ExxonMobil&#146;s wholly-owned insurance
  companies, i.e., Ancon Insurance Company, Inc., Bluefield International Insurance
  Inc., et al. (herein referred to collectively as &#147;ExxonMobil Captive
  Insurers&#148;); and (c) policies issued to affiliates by locally admitted
  insurers which are reinsured by one of the ExxonMobil Captive Insurers. All
  of the insurance policies through which the worldwide program of coverage is
  presently or has previously been provided by or to ExxonMobil, its
  predecessors or Affiliates are herein referred to collectively as the
  &#147;ExxonMobil Policies.&#148; 11.2 No Coverage and No Claims. It is understood and
  agreed by the Buyer that from and after the Closing: (a) no insurance
  coverage shall be provided under the ExxonMobil Policies to the Buyer; (b)
  any and all policies insured or reinsured by any of the ExxonMobil Captive
  Insurers which, but for this provision, would have insured any assets
  transferred pursuant to this Agreement, shall be deemed terminated, commuted
  and cancelled ab initio; and (c) no claims regarding any matter whatsoever,
  whether or not arising from events occurring prior to Closing, shall be made
  by the Buyer or its Affiliates and/or subsidiaries, against the Prior Exxon
  Owners or their Affiliates or any other member of the Exxon Mobil corporate
  group, or any of their respective employees or former employees and/or with
  respect to any of the ExxonMobil Policies regardless of their date of
  issuance. 11.3 Waiver of Subrogation. It is further agreed that the Buyer and
  its insurer(s) providing coverage shall waive all rights of subrogation

  liabilities of the Seller are assumed by the Buyer pursuant to the Agreement.

  prior to such disclosure. 12.2 Assignment. Except to the extent otherwise expressly
