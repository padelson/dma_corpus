17 (iii)  Consents to Transfer of Leased Properties. Except as otherwise set
forth  herein, the Seller will have no obligation to obtain any consent in
connection  with the assignment of any of the Leases. If a Lease to be
assigned to the  Buyer pursuant to this Agreement requires, either expressly
or by law, the  affirmative consent of the landlord under such Lease to
legally effectuate an  assignment thereof, then the Seller will request such
landlords consent to  the assignment in writing. If the Seller obtains such
consent, the Seller  shall provide notice thereof to the Buyer. If the Seller
has not obtained  such consent by the date which is fifteen (15) days prior
to the Closing  Date, the Seller will notify the Buyer thereof. In the event
the Leased  Property can be subleased to the Buyer without the consent of the
landlord  (or if the landlords right to withhold its consent is absolute in
the case  of assignments but subject to a reasonableness standard in the case
of  subleases), the Seller shall sublease the Leased Property to the Buyer
for  the duration of the lease period, including renewal terms. Only if the
Leased  Property cannot be assigned or subleased to the Buyer as provided
herein, the  Buyer may: (a) after notice to and consent of the Seller, which
consent may  be withheld for any reason whatsoever, use its own efforts to
obtain such  landlords consent to the extent such efforts do not create any
additional  liability to the Seller; (b) enter into a new lease with such
landlord  effective as of Closing Date so long as such landlord agrees to
terminate the  existing lease between such landlord and the Seller, and such
landlord  releases the Seller, effective as of the Closing Date, from any
liability  under such existing lease; or (c) remove such Leased Property from
this  Agreement (a "Dropped Leased Property") and reduce the Purchase Price
by the  amount of the Purchase Price allocated to such Leased Property set
forth on  Exhibit C. The Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to  obtain the landlord consents described on Schedule 2.2(b)(iii).
The Seller  shall request and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain estoppel  certificates with respect to each of the Leases which
require landlord to  deliver such certificates. (c) Personal Property and
Equipment. The Sellers  conveyance and assignment of its interests in the
Purchased Assets pursuant  to this Agreement will include all of the Sellers
Personal Property and  Equipment (including all of the Sellers interest in
remediation equipment,  monitoring wells and Sellers interest in any Tanks,
located above, on or  under the Properties as of the Closing Date), except as
otherwise specified  within this Agreement. The Personal Property (other than
the Tanks) and  Equipment will be identified on one or more Bills of Sale
substantially in  the form attached hereto as Exhibit H-1 (the "Bill of
Sale"). The Sellers  interest in the Tanks shall be conveyed to the Buyer
pursuant to one or more  UST Bills of Sale (the "UST Bill of Sale")
substantially in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit H-2. To the extent
possible, Tanks will be identified on a  UST Bill of Sale by number and size;
provided that any Orphaned Tanks,  whether or not specifically identified,
shall convey with the Property. The  Seller does not assume or retain any
liability or responsibility related to  any Tanks that may be discovered on
the Properties following Closing, and  such responsibility and Liability
shall be transferred to and assumed by the  Buyer as of Closing.

31 THE BUYER  ACKNOWLEDGES, REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS A
SOPHISTICATED REAL ESTATE  PURCHASER WHO HAS HERETOFORE HAD OPEN ACCESS TO,
AND SUFFICIENT TIME TO  REVIEW, ALL INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS, AGREEMENTS,
STUDIES, INVESTIGATIONS AND  TESTS RELATING TO THE PROPERTIES THAT THE BUYER
DEEMS NECESSARY IN ITS SOLE  DISCRETION. THE SURVIVAL OF THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS SECTION ARE A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT TO THE SELLER ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ACCORDINGLY SHALL  SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR ANY TERMINATION OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL BE DEEMED  TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CLOSING
DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED AT CLOSING. THE  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
CERTAIN INFORMATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO  THE BUYER IN AN ELECTRONIC FORM IN
AN ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION SITE (THE  "DATA SITE") ESTABLISHED BY RAYMOND
JAMES ON BEHALF OF THE SELLER. THE BUYER  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL SUCH
MATERIALS WERE MADE AVAILABLE AS AN ACCOMMODATION  ONLY, BUT THAT, EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, NEITHER THE  SELLER NOR RAYMOND JAMES,
NOR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,  EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR
CONTRACTORS, HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
REGARDING THE TRUTH OR ACCURACY OF ANY SUCH MATERIALS AND  THAT THE BUYER HAS
RELIED UPON ITS OWN DUE DILIGENCE AND INVESTIGATION AND  NOT UPON ANY SUCH
MATERIALS IN ITS EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTIES AND THE TRANSACTION.  4. REAL
ESTATE MATTERS; INSPECTION 4.1 Existing Title Policies. The Seller  has
provided the Buyer with copies of its title insurance policies issued by  the
Title Company for the Fee Properties and any commitments or policies the 
Seller holds with respect to the Leased Properties. 4.2 Title Insurance 
Policies. At Closing, the Buyer may obtain a title insurance policy or 
policies from the Title Company or any other title company selected by the 
Buyer for the Fee Properties conveyed and transferred to the Buyer under
this  Agreement, and/or one or more leasehold policies for the Leased
Properties.  The title insurance policy or policies for the Fee Properties
will insure  marketable title to such Fee Properties subject to the standard
exceptions to  title and to the matters described in Section 4.3 and Section
4.4 below. The  Buyer shall be responsible for the costs of all such title
insurance  policies, any title endorsements requested by the Buyer, and any
lender  coverage. 4.3 Conveyance of Title. At Closing, the Seller will convey
the Fee  Properties pursuant to the Deeds. The Seller shall remove from
title, at or  before Closing, all mortgages or deeds of trust or other
security interest  secured by a lien on the Fee Properties or any part
thereof. The Buyer and  the Seller agree that title to the Fee Properties
will be transferred subject  to the following permitted exceptions:

    |  

32 (a) the lien  for real property taxes for the current year provided the
same are not due  and payable prior to or as of the Closing Date, and any
liens for special  assessments which as of the closing Date are not due and
payable; (b) all  laws, ordinances, statutes, orders and regulations to which
the Fee  Properties are subject, including, without limitation, all building,
zoning and  environmental ordinances, laws and regulations, including, but
not limited  to, any notices of violations or non-compliance citations; (c)
any matters or  circumstances that a new or updated survey or physical
inspection of the  Properties might disclose; (d) all liens, encumbrances,
easements,  restrictions, encroachments, defects and other title and survey
matters  affecting the Fee Properties other than Material Defects to which
the Buyer  has a right to object and to which the Buyer actually objects
pursuant  Section 4.4 below, unless such Material Defect is not cured by the
Seller and  the Buyer nonetheless proceeds to Closing in accordance with the
terms of  Section 4.4 below; (e) all existing leases and/or rights of any
subtenant or  licensee of the Seller occupying any Property as of the Closing
Date; (f) all  notices of violations of law, municipal orders and/or similar
legal  requirements; and/or (g) any other restrictions described in the
Deeds. 4.4  Materially Adverse Title or Survey Encumbrance. The Buyer shall
have the  right to order a title search to be performed with regard to the
Properties,  and to order a commitment for title insurance (each, a
"Commitment," and  together, the "Commitments") to be issued by the Title
Company or any other  nationally recognized title insurance company with
regard to all or part of  such Properties, all at the Buyers sole cost and
expense. The Buyer may, no  later than thirty (30) days after the Effective
Date (the "Title Objection  Date"), deliver written notice to the Seller of
any title or survey defect,  lien, or other matter set forth in the
Commitment that encumbers or adversely  affects any such Property (excluding
any liens or matters created or arising  as a result of the Buyers
examination or inspection of the Assets including  any entry upon any real
property in connection therewith) that, individually  or in the aggregate
with respect to any given Property, (i) is unacceptable  to the Buyer and
(ii) materially adversely affects the continued use of such  Property in the
ordinary course of business as a gasoline service station  (such matters
being collectively referred to herein as "Material Defects,"  and each a
"Material Defect"), together with complete copies of each of any  title
report or Commitment, and all documents and instruments referred to  therein.
If the Buyer does not deliver such written notice to the Seller on  or before
the Title Objection Date, the Buyer shall be deemed to waive any  right to
object to such Material Defects, shall accept title to the affected
Properties  subject to such Material Defects, and shall proceed to Closing
without any  reduction in the Purchase Price. If, on or before the Title
Objection Date,  the Buyer properly gives notice to the Seller of one or more
Material  Defects, the Seller shall, within ten (10) days after receiving
such notice,  notify the Buyer whether the Seller will or will not attempt to
cure such  Material Defects (by removing

![](g92321kgi038.gif)

    |  

33 any such  Material Defect, bonding or obtaining insurance coverage over
such Material  Defect). Failure by the Seller to deliver such notice shall be
deemed the  Sellers election not to cure any Material Defects. (a) If the
Seller elects  (or is deemed to have elected) not to attempt to cure such
Material Defects,  the Buyer shall be entitled, by giving notice (the "Buyer
Notice") to the  Seller within three (3) days after receiving such notice
from the Seller (or  the date on which the Seller was deemed to have provided
such notice), to (x)  proceed to Closing without any reduction in the
Purchase Price or (y) remove  the Property with the uncured Material Defect
from this Agreement (a "Dropped  Title Property"), in which case the Closing
shall nevertheless proceed,  except that the Purchaser Price shall be reduced
by the portion of the  Purchase Price assigned to such Property on Exhibit C,
and such Property  shall no longer be a part of the Properties being
transferred hereunder;  provided, however, regardless of the number of
Properties with Material  Defects, the Buyer may remove (and receive a
reduction in the Purchase Price)  no more than three (3) Properties from this
Agreement pursuant to the  foregoing (the "Removal Limit"). If the Buyer does
not timely deliver the  Buyer Notice, the Buyer shall be deemed to waive any
right to object to such  Material Defects, shall accept title to the affected
Property subject to such  Material Defects, and shall proceed to Closing
without any reduction in the  Purchase Price. (b) If the Seller elects in
writing to attempt to cure any  Material Defects, but at the time of Closing
such Material Defects have not  been cured to the Buyers reasonable
satisfaction, the Buyers sole option  and remedy shall be either to (x)
proceed to Closing without any reduction in  the Purchase Price or (y) remove
such Property(ies) with the uncured Material  Defect from this Agreement, in
which case the Closing shall nevertheless  proceed, except that the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the portion of  the Purchase Price allocated to
such Property on Exhibit C, and such Property  shall no longer be subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement;  provided, however, the Removal
Limit shall not apply to any such Properties  as to which the Seller elected
but failed to cure Material Defects. (c) For  avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  this Agreement,
provided that the Conditions to Buyers Obligation to Close  (hereinafter
defined) are satisfied or waived by the Buyer and the Seller is  not in
material default under this Agreement, in each case beyond all applicable 
notice and cure periods set forth herein, the Buyer shall have no right to 
terminate this Agreement and the Buyer shall be obligated to close on the 
Closing Date on the acquisition of all of the Purchased Assets with no 
reduction in the Purchase Price, with the sole exception of the Dropped
Title  Properties and the Dropped Lease Properties. 4.5 Entry and Inspection.
(a)  Buyer and Seller acknowledge that they have entered into that certain
Access  and Indemnity Agreement, dated as March 16, 2015, pursuant to which
Seller  granted Buyer the right to access the Properties to conduct
inspections and  investigations pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
thereof. Prior to  Closing, the Buyer may

34 inspect the  Properties at a time mutually agreed upon by the Parties, at
the Buyers  expense, to ensure that the Properties Equipment necessary for
the operation  of the Properties consistent with the Sellers past practices
(and which is  to be conveyed to the Buyer at Closing) is present and in
working order. The  Buyer may inspect the Properties personally or through
agents, employees,  contractors, or subcontractors and shall assume all risks
involved in  entering the Properties pursuant to this Section 4.5. The
Sellers  representatives may attend all inspections. Any intrusive sampling
of any  soil, surface or groundwater shall be conducted by the Buyer in
accordance  with Article 5 below. The Buyer shall not engage in conversations
with  employees working at the Properties. For the avoidance of doubt, the
fact  that certain Equipment is found not to be in working order shall not
result  in a reduction of the Purchase Price, nor shall it excuse the Buyer
from its  obligation to close hereunder. The Buyer shall restore any damage
to the  Properties and to the Equipment, Improvements and Personal Property
located  thereon, caused by the Buyers entry upon the Properties pursuant to
this  Section 4.5(a). (b) No later than two (2) business days prior to the
Buyers  initial entry upon any Property either for the purposes of
inspection under  this Section 4.5 or under Section 5.3 below, the Buyer
shall deliver to the  Seller evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Seller
that the Buyer or its  contractors have obtained commercial general liability
insurance, in an  amount of not less than $2,000,000 written on such forms as
are commercially  reasonably and reasonably acceptable to the Seller, naming
the Seller as an  additional insured, with respect to the Properties and any
entry onto or  activities on or about the Properties by the Buyer and all of
the Buyers  agents, employees and contractors (and any others entering onto
the  Properties for or at the request of the Buyer). (c) The Buyer shall, and
does  hereby agree to, indemnify, defend and hold the Seller, its Affiliates,
the  direct and indirect members, partners, trustees, shareholders,
beneficiaries,  directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents of each
of them, and  their respective heirs, successors, personal representatives
and assigns  (collectively, the "Seller Related Parties"), harmless from and
against any  and all claims, demands, suits, obligations, payments, damages,
Losses,  penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to,  reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, the "Claims") caused
directly by  the Buyer, or by the Buyers contractors, employees or agents
and any others  entering onto the Properties for or at the request of the
Buyer  (collectively, the "Buyer Parties") or as the direct result of the
Buyer  Parties acts taken or occurring in, on or about the Property in the
exercise  of the inspection right granted pursuant to this Section 4.4(a);
provided,  however, such indemnity shall not extend to protect the Seller
from (a) any  pre-existing liabilities for matters merely discovered by the
Buyer (e.g.,  latent environmental contamination) so long as the Buyers
actions do not  materially exacerbate any pre-existing condition at the
Properties, or (b)  any claims, demands, suits, obligations, payments,
damages, losses,  penalties, liabilities costs or expense that are caused by
the negligence or  misconduct of the Seller. The provisions of this Section
4.4(c) shall survive  the termination of this Agreement or Closing for a
period of one (1) year,  provided that if the Seller has notified the Buyer
of a Claim during such one  (1) year period, the provisions of this Section
4.5(c) shall continue to  survive with respect to such Claim until the
resolution of such Claim.

35 (d) All  information received or accumulated by the Buyer or a Buyer Party
during any  inspection shall be treated as confidential information,
notwithstanding the  termination of this Agreement, and shall be deemed to be
"Evaluation  Material" governed by the terms of the Global NDA. 4.6
Equipment  Installation. The Buyer may enter the Properties to install
telephone lines  and other equipment needed to effect an orderly post-Closing
transition of  the operations within five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date (or  such other time as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree).
Such entry and  installation: (a) shall be at the Buyers sole risk and
expense; and (b) may  be conducted by the Buyer personally or through its
agents, employees,  contractors, or subcontractors. The Buyers right to
install equipment under  this Section 4.6 is subject to prior written notice
to and consent by the  Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld. The Buyer shall make  reasonable efforts not to disrupt existing
operations on the Properties and  shall keep the Properties free from any
liens or claims arising out of any  work performed, materials furnished, or
obligations incurred by or on behalf  of the Buyer. If any mechanics or
other lien is recorded against the  Properties, the Buyer shall pay the lien
or post any bond necessary to  discharge the lien of record within ten (10)
days after receiving notice of  the liens recording. 4.7 Failure to Close
after Installation of Equipment.  If the contemplated transaction is not
consummated for any reason, and the  Buyer has installed equipment on the
Properties in accordance with Section  4.6, the Buyer shall, at the Sellers
option: (a) remove the equipment  installed by the Buyer and restore the
Properties to their original condition  upon ten (10) days notice from the
Seller; or (b) transfer title to any equipment  installed by the Buyer to the
Seller, at no cost and without any express or  implied warranty, after which
the Seller will be solely responsible for such  equipment. In removing
equipment and restoring the Properties to their  original condition, the
Buyer shall make reasonable efforts not to disrupt  existing operations on
the Properties and shall assume all risks involved in  entering the
Properties in connection therewith. 4.8 Casualty. The Seller  shall keep the
Properties insured with such policy types and coverage amounts  as the Seller
maintains in the ordinary course of business until Closing or  earlier
termination of this Agreement. If there is any material damage to or 
destruction of a Property (a "Materially Damaged Property"), the Closing
with  respect to such Materially Damaged Property shall, at the Sellers
sole  discretion, nevertheless proceed, provided that, unless before Closing
the  same shall have been remedied and restored to substantially the same 
condition as it was on the Effective Date, at the Closing, the Seller shall 
pay over or assign to the Buyer any net insurance proceeds due to the Seller 
as a result of such damage or destruction (without recourse to the Seller) 
and the Buyer shall assume responsibility for such repair and receive a 
credit against the Purchase Price for any applicable policy deductible. 5. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 5.1 Compliance with Laws. The Buyer acknowledges that 
after the Closing it shall be responsible for compliance with all 
Environmental Laws (and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder) in 
connection with the Purchased Assets. Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, within three (3) months after the Closing, if required pursuant
to

36 applicable  regulations of the applicable Governmental Entity, the Tanks
shall be  inspected by the applicable Governmental Entity certified inspector
to verify  compliance with state and federal regulations. The Buyer shall be
responsible  for notifying the applicable Governmental Entity of the change
in ownership  of the Tanks and, at the Buyers sole cost and expense,
arranging for the  required inspection, if any. The Seller shall not be
responsible for any Tank  or equipment noncompliance that may be found as a
result of such inspections,  but shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers
performance of its obligations  under this Section 5.1. 5.2 Environmental
Assessment. The Seller has made  available to the Buyer certain Phase I
and/or Phase II Environmental Site  Assessments of the Properties and other
reports and information relating to  the Properties that the Seller obtained
from ExxonMobil, as well as  compliance reports and other environmental
information from the Sellers  files (the "Evaluations"). The Seller reserves
the right to undertake  additional environmental testing and compliance
examinations of the  Properties, as the Seller may desire, and undertake
corrective measures, at  its option, prior to Closing, provided that Seller
shall provide to Buyer  copies of any reports generated in connection with
such testing and  examination. 5.3 Environmental Inspections. The Buyer, its
agents, employees  and contractors, shall be entitled to enter upon any
Property, after not less  than two (2) business day prior notice to the
Seller to perform environmental  inspections, tests and evaluations of such
Property. All such environmental  and invasive testing shall be performed in
coordination with the Seller and  the Sellers environmental consultant. The
Seller shall be entitled to have a  representative present during any entry
onto the Property by the Buyer or its  agents to conduct any inspections or
tests. The Buyer shall perform all  inspections and tests in such a manner as
to minimize any interference with  the Sellers use and operation of a
Property. Any studies or tests that, when  being conducted, cause
unreasonable disruption or interference shall be  halted immediately upon the
Sellers request. At Sellers request, the Buyer  shall provide the Seller
with copies of any reports, studies or  investigations prepared by the Buyer
or its contractors in connection with  such inspections at no cost to the
Seller. 5.4 No Warranty of the  Evaluations. The Buyer understands and agrees
that the Evaluations were not  prepared for it and that the Buyer has no
right to rely upon the Evaluations.  The Seller makes no representation or
warranty that the Evaluations include  all of the information that may relate
to the Properties, nor does the Seller  make any representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of the  Evaluations. 5.5 Independent
Verification of the Evaluations. The Buyer  acknowledges by its consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby that  it had an opportunity to
conduct its own independent investigation regarding  the environmental
condition of the Properties and also had the opportunity  for independent
verification of the Evaluations, the environmental conditions  of the
Properties, and any other environmental-related information. 5.6 
Acknowledgments and Assumption of Risk. (a) THE BUYER SPECIFICALLY 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS THE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN USED FOR
COMMERCIAL  PURPOSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE STORAGE,

Environmental  Responsibility. (a) The Seller previously entered into the
Remediation  Contracts with the Remediation Contractors for the performance
of the  Remediation Activities to be performed at the Properties in order to

Agreement for  Environmental Liabilities shall be to cause to be performed

Closing, the Seller shall have  no further responsibility to the Buyer for
Environmental Liabilities whatsoever  for that Property after Closing, and
shall have no further obligation to  enforce the terms of the Remediation
Contracts thereafter. From and after the  Closing Date, the Buyer shall be
responsible for causing to be performed the  Remediation Activities related
to Covered Contamination set forth in the  Remediation Contracts. Achieving
Project Completion shall not require full  remediation of Contamination, but
rather written determination by the  applicable Governmental Entity that NFR
Status has been achieved for the  Property, excluding only post-NFR Status
monitoring which may be required in  certain cases. (c) The Seller will not
pay for and has no responsibility for  Contamination except as set forth
Section 5.7(b) above. The Buyer  specifically acknowledges and agrees that it
is solely responsible at its  sole cost and expense for, and assumes all
Environmental Liabilities and all  risk associated with, any and all
Contamination at, on, under, or migrating  or originating from the Properties
(other than with respect to the Sellers  Environmental Obligations). If the
Buyer transfers or assigns in part or all  of its interests in the
Properties, the Buyer agrees that such transfer or  assignment will not
release the Buyer from its assumption of Environmental Liabilities  or its
obligations for Remediation Activities. (d) The Buyer agrees that it  will,
where applicable and to the maximum extent possible and permitted under 
Environmental Laws, assist the Seller in seeking and obtaining reimbursement 
for any Remediation Activities paid for by the Seller prior to the Closing 
Date from any Government Reimbursement Fund. The Seller makes no warranties 
or representations concerning the ability of the Buyer or the Seller to 
recover against any Government Reimbursement Fund. (e) The Buyer expressly 
waives any right or claim it has against ExxonMobil and the Seller and the 
Seller Related Parties related to: (i) the selection of the Remediation 
Contractor; and (ii) all work performed by the Remediation Contractor. The 
Buyer agrees that it shall assume, as of the Closing Date, the Sellers 
obligation to enforce the Remediation Contracts against the Remediation 
Contractor.

39 (f) Except  for notification letters and/or communications by the Seller
or the  Remediation Contractor in connection with the Remediation Activities
included  in Sellers Environmental Obligations, the Buyer shall send or
cause to have  sent the applicable notification letters to all applicable
Governmental  Entities in connection with the Properties. No later than
thirty (30) days  after Closing, the Buyer shall submit or enter into any
other necessary  documentation, or documentation that is required by
Governmental Entities, to  transfer from the Seller to the Buyer, agreements
or obligations regarding the  Purchased Assets. The Buyer shall provide
copies of such documentation to the  Seller and take all necessary actions to
substitute itself as the responsible  party for any actions or activities
relating to Contamination at, on, under,  or originating or migrating from
the Properties. This shall include, without  limitation, the execution or
assumption of all agreements or consent orders  containing terms and
conditions required by the Governmental Entity for the  Buyer to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement. (g) Except for  notification letters and/or
communications by the Seller or the Remediation  Contractor in connection
with the Remediation Activities included in the  Sellers Environmental
Obligations, the Buyer further agrees to undertake, at  its sole expense,
from and after the Closing Date, all other reporting and  notification
required under the Environmental Laws for Contamination and  shall undertake,
in good faith and with due diligence, all Remediation  Activities of
Contamination and Covered Contamination (other than the  Sellers
Environmental Obligations) that are required by the relevant  Governmental
Entities and in compliance with the Environmental Laws. (h) The  Buyer agrees
to provide the Seller with any information of which the Buyer is  aware, or
which is in the Buyers possession or under the Buyers control,  relating to
any Contamination or any Property conditions that may affect the  performance
or the cost of the Remediation Activities included within the  Sellers
Environmental Obligations. The Buyer also agrees to notify the  Seller within
five (5) days of obtaining knowledge of any Excluded  Contamination, process
monitoring system inoperability, process monitoring  system failure, or
inventory discrepancy for any stored chemicals or products  at the
Properties. (i) Seller shall include Buyer as an additional insured on  its
Storage Tank Liability Insurance Policies and Premises Pollution  Liability
III Insurance Policies (collectively the "Environmental Insurance  Policies")
which provide coverage for the Properties. Seller shall be  required to
maintain the Environmental Insurance Policies in full force and  effect for a
period of at least two (2) years after the expiration or earlier  termination
of the Seller Lease. 5.8 Release and Indemnification. (a)  Release. The Buyer
expressly understands and agrees that except for the  representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.1 above and except for  Sellers Retained
Liabilities, Buyer is accepting the conveyance of the  Properties, in their
"AS IS, WHERE IS" condition as of Closing, and except  for any
indemnification obligation identified in Article 8, the Buyer shall  make no
claim against ExxonMobil or the Seller, the Sellers Affiliates,  their
officers and directors, employees, agents, attorneys,

40 subsidiary  and affiliate companies and divisions, and all of their
successors and  assigns (collectively the "Released Parties") with respect
to: (a) the  Contamination (including without limitation Covered
Contamination); (b) the  selection of the Remediation Contractor; (c) the
Remediation Contracts; (d)  any and all claims made by the Remediation
Contractors under the Remediation  Contracts, excluding only the Arcadis
Claim, and (d) the environmental  condition of the Properties, or the
Sellers ownership or operation of the  Properties. Effective upon the
occurrence of the Closing, except solely as  otherwise expressly provided for
herein, the Buyer and the Buyers Affiliates  hereby release the Released
Parties from ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING, BUT  NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE
ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE  AND STRICT
LIABILITY) AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OF THE RELEASED PARTIES PRIOR  TO CLOSING,
whether such claims are now existing or arising in the future,  foreseen or
unforeseen, known or unknown, at law or in equity, including  those which
arise out of or relate to or result in any way from, allegedly or  in fact,
the condition of the Properties, the Contamination (including  without
limitation Covered Contamination), or the ownership or operation of  the
Properties by the Seller. This release shall include, but is not limited  to
(x) any and all claims under the Environmental Laws; (y) any and all  claims
for injury, death, destruction, loss or damage to the person or  property of
the Buyer and the Buyers Affiliates arising out of (1) the  environmental
condition of the Properties and the improvements and the  equipment on the
Properties, and (2) the existence of Contamination  (including without
limitation Covered Contamination) at, on, under, or  migrating or originating
from the Properties; and (z) any and all Liability  for further assessment,
cleanup and remediation of any and all Contamination  (including without
limitation Covered Contamination) at the Properties. The  Buyer expressly
assumes all such Liabilities (other than Sellers Retained  Liabilities)
related to the foregoing. (b) Indemnification. Effective upon  the occurrence
of the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless  ExxonMobil (with
respect to the Properties other than the MD Fee Properties)  and the Seller
and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,  employees and
controlling persons, from and against any and all Losses  asserted against,
resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by any such person,  directly or
indirectly, by reason of or resulting from (1) the environmental  condition
of the Properties and the improvements and the equipment on the  Properties;
(2) the existence of Contamination (including without limitation  Covered
Contamination) at, on, under, or migrating or originating from the 
Properties; and (3) any and all Liability for further assessment, cleanup
and  remediation of any and all Contamination (including without limitation 
Covered Contamination) at the Properties. 5.9 Post-Closing Access. Upon 
request by the Seller, the Buyer shall provide for and permit the Seller and 
ExxonMobil access to the Properties, at no cost to the Seller, as the Seller 
or ExxonMobil may require, to undertake any environmental assessment, 
investigation, testing, and remediation that the Seller or ExxonMobil deems 
necessary in accordance with the terms of the ExxonMobil Deeds and/or the 
applicable ExxonMobil SPAs. Such access shall include, but is not limited
to,  the right to conduct such tests, take such groundwater or soil
samples,  excavate, remove, dispose of tanks and soil, and treat the soil
and  groundwater, conduct and/or continue environmental investigation,
testing and  remediation, and undertake such other actions as are

41 reasonably  necessary pursuant to such request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, or  anything herein to the contrary, it is understood and agreed
that the Seller  shall have no obligation to perform any remediation at the
Properties from  and after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  Agreement, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with
exclusive access rights to  the Properties to observe and/or confirm any
Remediation Activities  undertaken by or on behalf of the Buyer. The Seller
shall provide the Buyer  as much advance notice as reasonably practical of
all potentially disruptive  or intrusive activities to be undertaken on the
Properties by Seller or  ExxonMobil in accordance with the terms of the
ExxonMobil Deeds and/or the  applicable ExxonMobil SPAs; such notice may be
in the form of a periodic  written schedule of activities delivered from time
to time. No advance notice  shall be required for nondisruptive activities
such as periodic monitoring of  wells on the Properties, if any. 5.10
Engineering and Institutional Controls.  The Buyer acknowledges that the
Properties (other than the MD Fee Properties)  are and will be subject to
Engineering and Institutional Controls imposed in  connection with previous
and ongoing corrective action activities at the  Properties. The Buyer
further acknowledges and agrees that in conducting  Remediation Activities
(other than the Sellers Environmental Obligations),  the Buyer shall, at its
sole cost and expense, adopt and use all engineering  and related technical
assistance available and standard to the industry to  protect the health and
safety of persons by the Governmental Entities and as  required by ExxonMobil
pursuant to the ExxonMobil Deeds or the Seller to  enforce the requirements
of the ExxonMobil Deeds. The Seller agrees to  obtain, or cause the
Remediation Contractor to obtain, all necessary  approvals for any
Engineering and Institutional Controls required to achieve  Project
Completion at the Properties in accordance with the Seller\'s  Environmental
Obligation. The Buyer may need to consider the use of  engineering controls
to prevent the migration of vapors and/or liquids  containing Contamination
into any buildings, underground utilities or storm  water retention/detention
ponds, including, without limitation, vapor  extraction systems, vapor
barriers, sealed sumps and storm pond liners. The  Buyer hereby agrees to
maintain, preserve, and comply with all Engineering  and Institutional
Controls that are or may be in the future imposed on the  Properties in
connection with the Remediation Activities conducted prior or  subsequent to
the Closing Date. The Engineering and Institutional Controls  shall run with
the land for the benefit of ExxonMobil, the Seller and its  Affiliates and
shall bind the Buyer and its Affiliates, subsequent owners,  users and
occupiers of the Properties, including any successors, lessees,  assignees
and licensees, and shall continue unless released by the applicable 
Governmental Entity, the Seller or ExxonMobil. 5.11 Subsequent Transfers.
The  provisions of Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 will run with the land
of the  Properties (other than the MD Fee Properties) and shall be included
in the NY  Deeds from the Seller to the Buyer. The Buyer agrees that it will
not  complete any sale, transfer or assignment of any of its interests in the
NY  Fee Properties or any part thereof, or enter into any lease, license or
right  to occupy or use the NY Fee Properties or any part thereof without
first  obtaining from the subsequent owners, users, and occupiers of the
Properties,  including all successors, lessees, assignees, and licensees,
obligations  identical to the Buyers obligation pursuant to Sections 5.9,
5.10, 5.11 and  5.12. The Buyer will include a clause in all such documents,
giving  ExxonMobil and the Seller, and the Sellers successors and assignees,
the  right, but not the obligation, to enforce such obligations against the
Buyer  and its Affiliates, subsequent owners, users, and occupiers of the 
Properties, including any successors, lessees, assignees, and licensees. The 
Seller also may enforce any such obligations against the Buyer,

42  notwithstanding the subsequent transfer, lease, or mortgage of the NY
Fee  Properties or part thereof. Any transferee, assignee or successor
owner,  lessee, licensee, occupier or user of the Properties will take title
to the  NY Fee Properties subject to the terms of Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11
and 5.12.  The rights and benefits of Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 will
inure not  only to the Seller, but also to the benefit of the Seller, its
Affiliates,  successors and assigns. Neither the Buyer, nor any party
acquiring any right,  interest or title through or after the Buyer will be
permitted to vacate,  waive, eliminate, or in any way modify the rights and
benefits that  ExxonMobil, the Seller, its Affiliates, successors and assigns
have pursuant  to Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12. Any subsequent transfer
of the NY Fee  Properties will not alter the Buyers responsibilities and
obligations to the  Seller under this Agreement. 5.12 Maintenance of Records.
After Closing, the  Buyer shall maintain daily inventory and tank maintenance
records for the  Properties (other than the MD Fee Properties), as required
to comply with all  applicable Laws. The Buyer shall deliver legible copies
of such records to  the Seller within two (2) days of the Sellers request
for such records,  which the Seller shall request only if requested by
ExxonMobil pursuant to  the terms of the ExxonMobil Deeds or the applicable
ExxonMobil SPA. The  Seller will have the right to review these records as
the Seller deems  necessary to comply with the request of ExxonMobil.
Following Closing, the  Buyer agrees to continue to use, maintain, repair and
keep in good order the  existing remote monitoring system (e.g., a Veeder-
Root system) or a  comparable monitoring system for the tanks located on the
Properties. Within  thirty (30) days of the Sellers request, which Seller
may request only if  requested by ExxonMobil pursuant to the terms of the
ExxonMobil Deeds or the  applicable ExxonMobil SPA, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Seller legible  copies of "as built" surveys or construction plans
that depict the location  of any tanks, any underground piping or other
improvements installed or  constructed by the Buyer. 5.13 Tank Tightness
Testing. (a) Tightness Testing.  The Buyer, at the Buyers sole cost and
expense, may, but shall not be  obligated to, cause tank tightness testing to
be conducted by the Buyers  tightness testing contractor. A precision
tightness test will be used for  operating tanks that are used for fuel
storage on operating Properties, and a  pressure decay test will be used on
all Stage II vapor recovery lines.  Tightness testing will be conducted to
detect the presence of leaks in any  tank and will be completed in compliance
with the requirements of the applicable  Governmental Entity and all
applicable laws and regulations. (b) Failing  Tanks or Lines. If the
tightness testing results do not meet the application  Governmental Entitys
standards, then the Seller may elect, in its sole  discretion, to: (i)
terminate this Agreement with respect to the affected  Property; or (ii)
repair the tanks (or the entire tank field), as appropriate  under the
Sellers engineering standards, before Closing. If the Seller  elects to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.13(b)(i), Seller  shall notify
the Buyer in writing and the Buyer shall have the option within  five (5)
days after receiving such notice from the Seller to notify Seller in  writing
(Buyers "Election Notice") that Buyer elects to close on the  acquisition of
the affected Property and undertake any repair at its sole  cost and expense
with no reduction of the Purchase Price. If the Seller  elects to terminate
this Agreement with respect to a

43 Property or  Properties pursuant to Section 5.13(b)(i) above and Buyer
does not timely  deliver an Election Notice, then such Property or Properties
shall be dropped  from this Agreement and Purchase Price will be reduced by
the amount  attributable to such Property or Properties, as established by
Exhibit C,  which Exhibit will be amended to reflect the affected Propertys
withdrawal  from the Transaction. The Seller will have the right to delay
Closing for  each Property on which it will remove or repair tanks. (c)
Dispensers. The  Seller hereby advises the Buyer, and the Buyer acknowledges,
that the Seller  will conduct no tests with respect to any dispensers. After
Closing, the  Buyer is responsible and assumes the obligation for the
calibration of the  dispensers and for compliance with all applicable laws,
including, but not  limited to, all Environmental Laws, and applicable
registration and testing  requirements, including, but not limited to,
calibration of weights and  measures. (d) Tank Data. The Buyer acknowledges
that it has received and is  familiar with the facility Tank data provided by
the Seller. 6. CONDITIONS  PRECEDENT TO THE BUYERS OBLIGATIONS Each and

and Mount Vernon before December 1, 2025,  the Buyer shall pay to ExxonMobil
on behalf of Seller liquidated damages for  each of the affected Properties.
Liquidated damages will begin to accrue from  the date debranding occurs and

that Property) x (15 - the number of years  (including any partial year) from
the closing date under the Liberty/East  River ExxonMobil SPA (with respect

service station property with a comparable  volume of sales of Branded Fuel
with the prior written approval of ExxonMobil  for the branding of such
service station property, in which event no  liquidated damages will be
assessed for any period in which the substituted  service station property
remains branded under a Trademark and continues to  sell Branded Fuel; (b) no

46 requires  remediation resulting in a temporary or permanent closure of the
Property, in  each case, during the period in which the Property is required
to cease  operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer will not be
subject to  liquidated damages for any debranding that occurs within fifteen
(15) years  after the closing date under the Liberty/East River ExxonMobil
SPA (with  respect to NY Properties) or the closing date under the DAG
ExxonMobil SPA  (with respect to MD Properties), if the debranding is a
result of a Market  Withdrawal. 8.4 Damages for Debranding under the Motiva
Supply Agreement. The  MD Fee Properties shall remain branded Shell until
November 30, 2015 and  continue to sell only products authorized for sale
under Shells trademarks  and other brand identifications. If any of the
Properties sold by DAG is  debranded before November 30, 2015, the Buyer
shall be responsible for  reimbursing the Seller for any penalties or
unamortized balances of image or  incentive monies paid by the Seller to
Motiva on account of such debranding.  8.5 Incremental Volume Requirements.
The Buyer acknowledges that that the  Seller, as purchaser under the DAG
ExxonMobil SPA, is obligated to satisfy  certain incremental volume
requirements as more specifically set forth  therein, which requirements are
more particularly described in that certain  Closing Side Letter with DAG
Enterprises, dated September 25, 2009 (the "Side  Letter"), and set forth on
Schedule 8.5 attached hereto (the "Incremental  Volume Requirements"). The
Buyer hereby specifically assumes the obligation  to satisfy all such
Incremental Volume Requirements applicable to the  Purchased Assets in the
manner set forth in the DAG ExxonMobil SPA as  modified by the Side Letter,
including, without limitation the twenty-four  million (24,000,000)
incremental gallon requirement for White Oak, and  further including without
limitation all deadlines applicable to such  requirements and the liquidated
damages for noncompliance. The Buyer shall  pay all such amounts due under
this Section 8.5 directly to ExxonMobil, if,  as and when due in accordance
with the Side Letter, and shall indemnify and  hold harmless the Seller and
the Seller Related Parties for all Losses, costs  and damages suffered by the
Seller as the result of the Buyers breach of its  obligations under this
Section 8.5. 8.6 Survival. The Buyers obligations  under Sections 8.2, 8.3,
8.4 and 8.5 shall survive indefinitely. 9. CLOSING 9.1  Closing Date. Unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to  Section 10.1, and
provided that the conditions to the Closing set forth in  Article 6 and
Article 7 are satisfied or waived, the closing with respect to  the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place 
electronically or at the offices of the Title Company or any other location 
mutually-agreed upon by the Parties and shall take place on or before June
1,  2015 (the "Closing Date"). (a) The Closing Date is subject to a one-
time  extension not to exceed thirty (30) days only (i) if required in
connection  with the filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; (ii) if an
extension is  reasonably required for the Seller to satisfy a Condition to
Buyers  Obligation to Close on the Closing Date, provided that the Seller
is  diligently seeking to satisfy such condition, (iii) if an extension is 
reasonably required to obtain

47 approvals,  authorizations or waivers reasonably required from Getty or
ExxonMobil in  connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder,
provided that the  parties are diligently seeking such approvals,
authorizations or waivers,  (iv) if an extension is reasonably required for
the Seller to obtain Motivas  waivers of its purchase options under Section
2.1(d), provided that the  Seller is diligently seeking to obtain such
waivers, (v) if the Closing must  be delayed due to any litigation filed
seeking to enjoin the consummation of  the entire transaction contemplated
hereunder, provided that Seller and Buyer  are diligently seeking to resolve
matter, or (vi) if requested by the Buyer  for any other reason and consented
to by the Seller in its sole and absolute  discretion. Any extension pursuant
to Subsection 9.1(a)(vi) shall be subject  to the Buyers delivery of an
additional deposit (the "Extension Deposit") to  the Title Company in the
amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). The  Extension Deposit shall
become a part of the Deposit under this Agreement and  from and after the
date it is delivered by the Buyer, the term "Deposit" as  used herein shall
be deemed to include the original Deposit together with the  Extension
Deposit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller mutually  agree that
in the event any court of competent jurisdiction issues an order (an 
"Injunction") enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the closing of the 
transaction contemplated by the Agreement, or the closing on the sale of any 
individual Property or Properties (an "Enjoined Property" or "Enjoined 
Properties") as applicable, then Closing under this Agreement shall be 
bifurcated so that the closing on the Properties that are not prohibited
from  Closing shall occur on the Closing Date and the closing on the sale of
the  Enjoined Property or Enjoined Properties shall occur on a date
mutually  selected by Buyer and Seller no later than twenty (20) days after
the  injunction prohibiting closing on the Enjoined Property or Enjoined 
Properties, as applicable, is vacated or modified so that closing on such 
Enjoined Property or Enjoined Properties, as applicable, is no longer 
prohibited. In such event, the Purchase Price, and the documents to be 
delivered at Closing, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
closing  in two or more phases. (b) The Buyer may arrange for a meeting with
the dealers  under the PMPA Franchise Agreements and the commissioned agents
under the CA  Agreements at a time and location mutually acceptable the Buyer
and the  Seller to discuss and finalize the transition of the Properties. The
Seller  shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer to schedule such meeting.
The Buyer  and the Seller shall coordinate the distribution, completion and
return of  the Buyers standard credit and electronic funds transfer ("EFT")
paperwork to  and from the dealers and commissioned agents on a mutually-
acceptable  timeline prior to such meeting. Except for written communications
regarding  such credit and EFT paperwork and written notice of any scheduled
meeting,  which shall be agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller, prior to any
such  meeting, the Buyer shall not initiate communication with any of such
dealers  or commissioned agents regarding the sale or transfer of the
Purchased Assets  without the Sellers prior reasonable consent. 9.2 Items to
be Delivered by  the Seller. At or prior to the Closing, as applicable, the
Seller shall  deliver the following documents, in each case duly executed or
otherwise in  proper form to the Title Company: (a) the Deeds executed by the

special taxes or  assessments for the then current year relating to the
Purchased Assets will  be prorated as of the date of Closing and adjusted at
Closing. If Closing  occurs before taxes are finalized for the then current
year, the tax  apportionment at Closing will be based on the latest tax rate
as applied to  the latest assessed valuation of the Purchased Assets. All
utilities and  other pro-ratable items customarily adjusted for commercial
real estate  closings conducted in the State of New York, will be adjusted as
of the  Closing Date. In the event that collected funds are insufficient to
pay all  such expenses, the Buyer promptly shall pay the same and provide

by the Title  Company, the Title Company shall refund the balance to the
Buyer. 9.5 Title  Insurance, Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall pay for all

than $1,000,000 in the  aggregate, then such Shared Recordation Costs shall
be split equally between  the Buyer and the Seller; (b) if such Shared

first $500,000 due for the  Shared Recordation Costs shall be paid by the
Buyer, (II) the next $1,000,000  due for the Shared Recordation Costs shall
be paid by the Seller, and (III)  after payment of Shared Recordation Costs

prior owner of  the Properties other than the MD Fee Properties ("Prior Exxon
Owners"). The  Seller and the Buyer acknowledge that ExxonMobil maintains a
worldwide  program of property and liability insurance coverage for itself
and its  Affiliates, including the Prior Exxon Owners. This program has been
designed  to achieve a coordinated risk-management package for the entire
ExxonMobil  corporate group. The program consists principally of three types
of policies:  (a) policies issued to ExxonMobil or its predecessors; (b)
policies issued  directly to affiliates by one of ExxonMobils wholly-owned
insurance  companies, i.e., Ancon Insurance Company, Inc., Bluefield
International Insurance  Inc., et al. (herein referred to collectively as
"ExxonMobil Captive  Insurers"); and (c) policies issued to affiliates by
locally admitted  insurers which are reinsured by one of the ExxonMobil
Captive Insurers. All  of the insurance policies through which the worldwide
program of coverage is  presently or has previously been provided by or to
ExxonMobil, its  predecessors or Affiliates are herein referred to
collectively as the  "ExxonMobil Policies." 11.2 No Coverage and No Claims.
It is understood and  agreed by the Buyer that from and after the Closing:
(a) no insurance  coverage shall be provided under the ExxonMobil Policies to
the Buyer; (b)  any and all policies insured or reinsured by any of the
ExxonMobil Captive  Insurers which, but for this provision, would have
insured any assets  transferred pursuant to this Agreement, shall be deemed
terminated, commuted  and cancelled ab initio; and (c) no claims regarding
any matter whatsoever,  whether or not arising from events occurring prior to
Closing, shall be made  by the Buyer or its Affiliates and/or subsidiaries,
against the Prior Exxon  Owners or their Affiliates or any other member of
the Exxon Mobil corporate  group, or any of their respective employees or
former employees and/or with  respect to any of the ExxonMobil Policies
regardless of their date of  issuance. 11.3 Waiver of Subrogation. It is
further agreed that the Buyer and  its insurer(s) providing coverage shall
waive all rights of subrogation  against the Prior Exxon Owners and their
Affiliates to the extent any  liabilities of the Seller are assumed by the
Buyer pursuant to the Agreement.  12. MISCELLANEOUS 12.1 Publicity. The Buyer
and the Seller each agrees that,  from and after the date of this Agreement,
no public release, written  statement or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby  shall be issued or made without the prior
written consent of the other party,  except for the content of any such
release or announcement that is, in the  reasonable judgment of the Buyer or
the Seller, as applicable, required by  Law, which release or announcement,
shall be made available to the Seller or  the Buyer, as applicable, for its
review as soon as reasonably practicable  prior to such disclosure. 12.2
Assignment. Except to the extent otherwise expressly  set forth in this
Agreement, the Buyer shall not assign, transfer or encumber  this Agreement,
or its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,  voluntarily or
by operation of Law, without the prior written consent of the  Seller, and
any attempted assignment, transfer or encumbrance without such  consent shall
be void and without effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  subject to the
Sellers

part, to  an affiliate or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, provided
that the  Buyer shall provide written notice to the Seller of such request no
later  than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, and further
provided  that the Buyer shall remain jointly and severally liable with such
assignee  for the performance and obligations of the Buyer hereunder. In

forth in a written instrument  executed and delivered by the Party so
waiving. Except as provided in the  preceding sentence, no action taken

Party taking such action of compliance  with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in  this Agreement and in any documents
delivered or to be delivered pursuant to  this Agreement and in connection
with the Closing under this Agreement. The  waiver by any Party of a breach
