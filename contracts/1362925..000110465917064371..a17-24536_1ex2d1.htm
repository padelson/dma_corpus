 ** _THE OFFER_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Tender Offer_.

 



 

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have previously been validly terminated in
accordance with _Article 8_, as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within the ten (10) Business Day period commencing on the first (1st) Business
Day after the date hereof, Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer for (i) all of the outstanding
Company Common Stock (including any Company Common Stock subject to repurchase
rights in favor of the Company) at a price per share equal to the Common Stock
Offer Price and (ii) all of the outstanding Company Series A Preferred Stock
at a price per share equal to the Preferred Stock Offer Price. The date on
which Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act, is referred to as the " **Offer Commencement Date**."

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 2.1(e)_, as promptly as practicable on the later of
(i) the earliest date as of which Acquisition Sub is permitted under
applicable Law to accept for payment Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn),
and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (the " **Offer Conditions** ") shall have been satisfied or waived,
Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for
payment all Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn). The obligation of
Acquisition Sub to accept for payment Company Common Stock and Company Series
A Preferred Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall not be
subject to any other conditions). As promptly as possible after the acceptance
for payment of any Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall pay for such Company
Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the right (x) to increase the
Common Stock Offer Price or Preferred Stock Offer Price and (y) to waive any
condition to the Offer (to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

permitted under applicable Laws) or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub shall:

 



 

(i) change or waive the Minimum Condition;

 



 

(ii) decrease the number of Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock sought to be purchased by Acquisition Sub in the Offer;

 



 

(iii) reduce the Common Stock Offer Price or Preferred Stock Offer Price;

 



 

(iv) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except to
the extent required or permitted pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_);

 



 

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

 



 

(vi) impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions;

 



 

(vii) amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner
adversely affecting, or that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on, any of the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Series A
Preferred Stock; or

 



 

(viii) take any action (or fail to take any action) that would result in the
Merger not being permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL.

 



 

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at the later of (i) midnight (New York City
time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose,
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of the Offer or (ii) 5:00 p.m. (New York City Time) on December
18, 2017 (the " **Initial Expiration Date** ") or, in the event the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the "
**Expiration Date** ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
the Parties respective termination rights under _Section 8.1_, Acquisition
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, extend the Offer from
time to time as follows: (i) if on the then-scheduled Expiration Date, the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions
has not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Acquisition Sub if permitted
hereunder, then Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for one (1) or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or
such shorter period as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company) in order to
permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions (subject to the right of
Parent or Acquisition Sub to waive any Offer Condition, other than the Minimum
Condition); and (ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the
NASDAQ Stock Market

 



      
 

 



 

(" **NASDAQ** ") or its staff applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_
, that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer and the
Expiration Date to a date later than the End Date.

 



 

(f) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Common
Stock Offer Price and Preferred Stock Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately and proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time,
and such adjustment to the Common Stock Offer Price and Preferred Stock Offer
Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Series
A Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(f)_ shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event that this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Acquisition Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination or the next Business Day, if
terminated on a non-Business Day), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer, shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Offer and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Acquisition Sub to return, in accordance with applicable
Law, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Actions of Parent and Acquisition Sub_.

 



 

(a) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (i) file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits
thereto, the " **Schedule TO** ") that will contain or incorporate by
reference the offer to purchase (the " **Offer to Purchase** ") and form of
the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO
and the documents included therein, together with all amendments, supplements
and exhibits thereto, the " **Offer Document** ") and (ii) cause the Offer to
Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock. Parent and
Acquisition Sub agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by
either Parent or Acquisition Sub with the SEC to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Law and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent, Acquisition Sub or
Parents legal counsel any information concerning the Acquired Companies and
the Companys stockholders that is required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 2.2(a)_. The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Acquisition Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with copies of
any comments (including a summary of any oral comments) that Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. For
purposes of this Agreement, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to
by the Company and Acquisition Sub, any shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Series A Preferred Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery
shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the
shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to
Acquisition Sub or to an agent of Acquisition Sub. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
Recommendation as it may be amended or modified, and until but not after it is
withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement, and to the inclusion
of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred
Stock.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.10_, and subject in all
respects to the other terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Offer
Conditions, Parent shall cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub all of the
funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Series A Preferred Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Acquisition Sub to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, and each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall ensure
that all of their respective controlled Affiliates shall, tender any shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock held by them into
the Offer.

 



 

(c) The Parties expressly elect to have this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause the Merger to be effected as soon as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Actions of the Company_.

 



 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are first filed with the SEC, the Company
shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the initial
dissemination of the Offer Documents to holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Series A Preferred Stock, and subject to the final sentence of
_Section 2.3(b)_) disseminate to holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Series A Preferred Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " **Schedule
14D-9** ") that, subject to _Section 2.3(d)_, shall contain the
recommendation of the Company Board that stockholders of the Company tender
their Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to
the Offer (the " **Company**

 



       
 

 



 

 **Board Recommendation** "). Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
and/or the dissemination thereof to holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Series A Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
need not give Parent and its counsel such opportunity to review and comment in
connection with any amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 that relates
to any Acquisition Proposal or any Change in Recommendation. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent and its counsel with a copy or a description of any
comments received by the Company (or its counsel) from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and give
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
response to such comments provided to the SEC or its staff; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company need not give Parent and its counsel such
opportunity to review and comment in connection with any such response or
comments that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any Change in
Recommendation.

 



 

(b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall take all steps
necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to
correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and, subject to the final
sentence of this _Section 2.3(b)_, to be disseminated to holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent or
Acquisition Sub that may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with any action contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_. To the extent
requested by the Company, Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 and any
supplement or amendment thereto to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock together
with the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock
and Company Series A Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as
permitted by _Section 2.3(d)_ or _Section 6.2_: (i) withdraw, modify, amend
or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Schedule 14D-9, (iv) if any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acquisition Proposal in the circumstances described in clause (v) below) has
been made public, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon
request of Parent within five (5) Business Days upon receipt of a request from
Parent to do so; provided, that, Parent may make such request only once with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently materially modified in which case Parent may make such request
once each time such material modification is made, (v) fail to recommend
against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days
after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, (vi) publicly
propose or publicly announce an intention to take any of the foregoing actions
(any action described in clause "(i)" or clause "(vi)" being referred to as a
" **Change in Recommendation** "), or (vii) cause the Company to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or
contract (other than a confidentiality agreement

 



      
 

 



 

entered into in compliance with _Section 6.2(a)_) contemplating an
Acquisition Proposal (any such contract, an " **Alternative Acquisition
Agreement** ") or otherwise resolve or agree to do so.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may:

 



 

(i) make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal
and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_ to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning an
Acquisition Proposal if (and prior to taking such action): (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of _Section
6.2(a)_; (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, (1) that
such Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement or the Offer were not
amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into,
constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) that in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, a failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning such Acquisition Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Laws; (C) the Company delivers to
Parent a written notice (the " **Superior Proposal Notice** ") stating that
the Company Board intends to take such action and (in the event the Company
Board contemplates causing the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, including a copy of such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement) specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor, including all required information under _Section 6.2(b)_ (which
notice shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation); (D) during the five
(5) Business Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such
Superior Proposal Notice (as may be renewed pursuant to clause "(F)" below,
the " **Notice Period**"), the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors, legal counsel and its representatives to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith during the Notice Period (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a
possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; (E)
after the expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Acquisition Sub have irrevocably
agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by
clause "(D)" above, that (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (2) the failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ to enter into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Laws; and (F) in the event of any material amendment to the terms of any
Superior Proposal (including any financial terms), the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause "(C)" above and a new Notice Period under this _Section
2.3(d)(i)_ shall commence, during which time the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 2.3(d)(i)_

 



      
 

 



 

anew with respect to such additional notice, except that such Notice Period
shall be two (2) Business Days instead of five (5) Business Days; or

 



 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal if
(and prior to taking such action): (A) any Change in Circumstances arises; (B)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that, in light of such Change
in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Laws; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a
written notice (the " **Change in Circumstances Notice** ") stating that the
Company Board intends to effect a Change in Recommendation and specifying in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances causing such Change in
Recommendation to be necessary, and such Change in Recommendation is not
effected prior to the fifth Business Day after Parent receives from the
Company the Change in Circumstances Notice; (D) during such five (5) Business
Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of the Change in
Circumstances Notice (as may be renewed pursuant to clause "(F)" below, the "
**Change in Circumstances Notice Period** "), if requested by Parent, the
Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement
or the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction so that a Change in
Recommendation would no longer be necessary; (E) after the expiration of the
Change in Circumstances Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the
Offer that Parent and Acquisition Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to
make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that,
in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Laws; and (F) in
the event of any material change to the facts and circumstances specified by
the Company pursuant to clause "(C)" above, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described
in clause "(C)" above and a new Change in Circumstances Notice Period under
this _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_ shall commence, during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, except that such Change in
Circumstances Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days instead of five (5)
Business Days.

 



 

(e) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish to Acquisition Sub a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of all record and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Series A Preferred Stock and their addresses, as well as mailing labels
containing such names and addresses. The Company will furnish Acquisition Sub
with such additional information (including any security position listings in
the Companys possession) and assistance as Acquisition Sub may reasonably
request for purposes of communicating the Offer to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock. All information furnished
in accordance with this _Section 2.3(e)_ shall be held in confidence by
Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance with the requirements of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and shall be used by Parent and Acquisition Sub
only in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with the communication of the Offer to the holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Series A Preferred Stock.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than

applicable (the " **Merger Consideration** "), without interest. At the
Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series A

Certificate** ") formerly representing any of such shares (other than Excluded

the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and each
Company Stock Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Series A Preferred Stock, or Book Entry Shares owned by Dissenting
Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment
to which reference is made in _Section 3.6_.

 



 

(ii) Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist,

(b) Subject to _Section 2.1(f)_, if, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock or Company Series A
Preferred Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the amount of cash into
which each share of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock
is converted in the Merger shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Payment for Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred
Stock_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " **Paying
Agent** ") for the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock to receive the aggregate Common Stock Offer Price and
Preferred Stock Offer Price to which holders of such shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and to act as agent for the holders of
shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of such
shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5_. Promptly after (and
in any event no later than the third Business Day after) the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Common Stock Offer Price
and Preferred Stock Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_. On or
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.5_ (together with the amount
deposited pursuant the immediately preceding sentence, the " **Payment Fund**
"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the
aggregate Common Stock Offer Price and Preferred Stock Offer Price in the
Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Payment Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be (w) in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (y) in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or (z) in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such
case, no such instrument shall

 



      
 

 



 

have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent Parent becomes aware
that (i) there are any losses with respect to any such investments or (ii) the
Payment Fund has diminished for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and
_Section 3.5_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that
the Payment Fund is, at all times during the duration of the Payment Fund,
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and _Section 3.5_, taking into account any
payments already made from the Payment Fund.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable (and in no event less than five (5) Business
Days) after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock described in
_Section 3.5_ a form of letter of transmittal (mutually approved by Parent
and the Company) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares previously representing such
Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for
payment therefor. Parent shall ensure that, upon surrender to the Paying Agent
of each such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Company Stock Certificate pursuant to _Section 3.12)_,
together with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share (or, under the circumstances
described in _Section 3.6(e)_, the transferee of the Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share) shall promptly receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash to which such holder (or transferee) is entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.5_. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in
accordance with the Paying Agents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry.

 



 

(c) On or after the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the
Surviving Corporation any funds made available by Parent to the Paying Agent
which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation with respect to the cash amounts payable upon
surrender of their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Neither
the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property or
escheat law.

 



 

(d) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the cash amount payable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made with respect to such Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock to a transferee of such Company Common Stock
if the Company Stock

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate (if applicable) previously representing such Company Common Stock
or Company Series A Preferred Stock is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes relating to such transfer have been paid.

 



 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment
for Company Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Company Compensatory Awards._

 



 

(a) _Termination of Company Equity Incentive Plans_. Except as otherwise
agreed to by the Parties in writing, (i) the Company Equity Incentive Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of any Acquired Company thereof shall
be cancelled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time no participant in the Company Equity Incentive
Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary thereof.

 



 

(b) _Company Common Stock Options_. Immediately prior to, and contingent upon
the consummation of, the Closing, each Company Common Stock Option, to the
extent then-unvested, shall immediately vest and become exercisable and, at
the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Common Stock Option shall be
cancelled, (i) in the case of a Company Common Stock Option having a per share
exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, for the right to receive
from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash (without
interest thereon) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Common Stock Option, and
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of such Company Common Stock Options such amount as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.7(d)_, or (ii) in the case
of any Company Common Stock Option having a per share exercise price equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, without the payment of cash or
issuance of other securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company
Common Stock Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had
in respect of such Company Common Stock Option. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock Options
notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested and all restrictions and
repurchase rights thereon shall lapse and all such shares of Company
Restricted Stock Awards shall be converted automatically into

 



      
 

 



 

the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest
thereon) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares subject to
Company Restricted Stock Awards (with the number of shares subject to Company
Restricted Stock Awards subject to one or more performance conditions deemed
to be equal to target levels) and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Compensatory Awards. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the applicable holders of Company Compensatory Awards will
receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its
payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such
holders in respect of such Company Compensatory Awards that are cancelled and
converted pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_ or _Section 3.7(c)_, as applicable.
All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company
Compensatory Awards pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_ or _Section 3.7(c)_ as
applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving
Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check
will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the
Closing Date (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter).

 



 

Section 3.8 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock that constitute
Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
payment in accordance with _Section 3.5_, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares as
may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From and
after the Effective Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall not have and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of
a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares
shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise lose such holders right of appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) any right of such holder to require
the Surviving Corporation to purchase such Appraisal Shares for cash shall be
extinguished, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be converted
into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
Company Stock Certificate(s) or Book Entry Shares previously representing such
Appraisal Shares) payment for such Appraisal Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.5_.

 



 

(b) The Company (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand, or
any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of such demand, by any stockholder of
the Company for appraisal of such stockholders Company Common Stock or
Company Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii)
shall give Parent the opportunity and right to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company shall not make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle
any such demands for appraisal or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand (or an appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing) without
the consent of Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Appraisal Shares** " shall refer to
any Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by stockholders who are
entitled to demand, and have properly demanded, their appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The Merger shall be
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The Parties agree to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (in the
name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company or otherwise) take such
action.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Withholding of Tax_. After consultation with and providing
adequate written notice to the Company, each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A
Preferred Stock, Company Common Stock Options and/or Company Restricted Stock
Awards such amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof
or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent and withheld amounts are paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with Laws or Order, then for all
purposes of this Agreement such amounts shall be treated as having been paid
to the former holder of a Company Stock Certificate or Company Common Stock
Option in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Lost Company Stock Certificates_. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate without any interest thereon.

the Company represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition Sub as
follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Due Organization and Good Standing; Subsidiaries_.

character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, with
respect to clause (iii), where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Subsidiary of the Company and indicates its jurisdiction of organization. None
of the Acquired Companies owns any capital stock of, or any equity interest
of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any other Entity, other than

prior to, engaging in any transaction or entering into any agreement
exclusively among the Acquired Companies.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, not to and will
instruct, and use commercially reasonable efforts, to cause its
representatives not to:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, endorse, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
the submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry or any proposals or offers that constitute or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including by approving any
transaction, or approving any Person becoming an "interested stockholder," for
purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL);

 



 

(ii) furnish any information regarding the Company to any Person in connection
with, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;

 



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or

document, agreement or commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written
or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than any confidentiality agreement contemplated by this _Section 6.2_).

 



 

 _provided_ , _however ,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company and its representatives may engage in
any such discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in
response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal if, and
only to the extent that: prior to providing any non-public information and/or
engaging in any discussions or negotiations with any Third Party in response
to such Acquisition Proposal, (A) the Company receives from such Third Party
(or there is then in effect with such party) an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not more favorable in any material respect to such Third
Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which shall
not prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of _Section 2.3(d)_ or
this _Section 6.2_; and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. Prior to or
concurrent with providing any non-public information to such Third Party, the
Company shall make such non-public information available to Parent (to the
extent such material non-public information has not been previously made
available by the Company to Parent or Parents representatives).

 



 

(b) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry)
notify Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(which notification shall include the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the material
terms and conditions thereof), and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably
informed of any material change to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company shall, and shall ensure that its representatives, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions
or negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry. The Company also agrees that (i) to the extent it has not
previously done so, it will promptly request each Third Party that has
executed a confidentiality agreement prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of a transaction involving, or the
acquisition of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any portion
thereof) to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person or its representatives by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
release any Third Party from, or terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality or standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, unless the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board, and (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions
of any such agreement.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their representatives from:
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, provided that any
such disclosure does not contain any Change in Recommendation; (ii) disclosing
to the Companys stockholders any factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the fact that
an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, in
each case, only if the Company in good faith determines (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that such information, facts, identity or
terms are required to be disclosed under applicable Law (and no such
disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation); or (iii) furnishing a copy or excerpts of this Agreement to
any Person (or the representatives of such Person) that makes any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or communicating with such Person to the
extent necessary to direct such Person to the provisions of this _Section
6.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not make any
Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Filings; Other Action_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i) as promptly as
practicable, and in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following
the date hereof make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions
required to be made or effected by it pursuant to the HSR Act, the Exchange
Act and other applicable Laws with respect to the Offer and the Merger; (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
required from Third Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken,
on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose
of consummating and effectuating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) in no event shall the Company be
required or

 



      
 

 



 

permitted to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee (except for customary
fees to Governmental Entities), penalty or other consideration to any Person
for any consent or approval required for the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B) subject to _Section 8.3(a)_,
in no event shall Parent be required to pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any Person for any consent or approval in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (C) notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary (including clause "(a)" of this _Section
6.3_), Parent shall not have any obligation to divest or dispose of any asset
or business of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or take any action or accept any condition or undertaking that
individually or together with any other such action, condition or undertaking
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect
on the business, financial condition, results of operations of either the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each, a " **Burdensome Restraint** "). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
(A) shall promptly provide all information requested by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly take, and cause its controlled Affiliates to take,
actions and steps necessary to obtain any clearance or approval required to be
obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of
Justice, any state attorney general, any foreign competition authority or any
other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided, that,
subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to outside counsel, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to or other communication with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section
6.3(a)_, subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall: (i) give the other
Parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other Parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or
the Merger. Each Party will consult and cooperate with the other Parties and
will consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, each Party
will permit authorized representatives of the other Parties to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection

 



      
 

 



 

with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, in the event that any litigation
or other administrative or judicial action or Legal Proceeding is commenced
challenging the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cooperate
with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest any
such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to the Acquired Companies employees, customers, vendors,
partners, properties, books, records and contracts and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all available information concerning its business as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall
not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a) result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties; (b) violate any
obligation of the Acquired Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-
disclosure or privacy; (c) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under
the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine; (d)
violate any Law (it being agreed that, with respect to subclauses (a), (b) and
(c), that the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention); or (e) materially interfere with the conduct of the
Acquired Companies business. All information obtained by Parent and its
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be treated as
"Evaluation Material" of the Acquired Companies for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available to Parent. All requests for access pursuant to this _Section 6.4_
must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company or another Person
designated in writing by the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not, and shall cause their
respective representatives not to, contact any customer or supplier of the
Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the Companys prior consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Parent
and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that any such contact shall be
arranged by and with a representative of the Company participating.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub_. During the period from
the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of

Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public announcements
or scheduling a press conference or conference calls with investors or
analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such other public announcement without the prior consent of the other
Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that (i) a party hereto may, without the prior consent of
the other Parties, issue any press release or make any public statement or
other announcement as may be required by Law or Order, by the rules of NASDAQ
or by any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable national
securities exchange, trading market or listing authority, if it has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other Parties and to
obtain such Parties consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time
such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made,
and (ii) the Company and Parent will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation or obtain any such consent with respect to any communication (1)
that is principally directed to employees, customers, partners or vendors so
long as such communications are consistent with previous releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually,
if approved by the other party), or (2) relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
Superior Proposal, Change in Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. As promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement and in compliance with applicable Laws, Parent and the
Company shall develop a joint plan for communication to the Companys
employees, independent contractors, customers, suppliers and other strategic
Persons about this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and upon development of such plan, Parent and the Company shall
comply with such plan. Prior to making any written or oral communications to
the employees or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication; _provided_ that the Company and Parent will not be
obligated to engage in such consultation or obtain any such consent with
respect to any communication that is principally directed to employees,
customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent
with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party).

 



 

Section 6.7 _Other Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
or, if later, until December 31, 2018, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to each employee of the Acquired Companies
who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time (each, a " **Continuing Employee** ") with (i) salary or
base pay and target bonus and commission opportunities that, in the aggregate,
are not less favorable than as provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and
benefits (excluding defined benefit plan benefits, equity and equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are not less favorable than as provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Effective Time, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits) for service with the Acquired Companies (or predecessor employers to
the extent the Company provides such past service credit) under the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, in which such employees became participants;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit to
Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of Continuing Employees, Parent
shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the
Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor in
accordance with their terms (including terms relating to the amendment or
termination of such plans, agreements and arrangements) all deferred
compensation plans, agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay
plans, agreements and arrangements, and all written employment, severance,
retention, incentive, change in control and termination agreements (including
any change-in-control provisions therein) applicable to employees of the
Company and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit
Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " **401(k)
Plans**"), effective not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the
Acceptance Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) Plan(s) be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k)
Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval
by Parent).

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of
its benefit plans or any Company Benefit Plan assumed by Parent, in each case,
in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee to employment
with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or (iv) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any
benefit plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.8 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (the " **Compensation Committee**
") will cause each Company Benefit Plan and Company employment agreement
pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or
employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of the Acquired Companies pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in
effect between any Acquired Company and any Indemnified Party and (ii) any
indemnification, exculpation from liability or advancement of expenses
provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies,
in each case, as in effect on the date hereof. The Organizational Documents of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of expenses set
forth in the Acquired Companies Organizational Documents on the date hereof
and, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, such provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that could
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against and from any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry, whether civil,
criminal, regulatory, legislative administrative or investigative, to the
extent such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry
arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified
Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Acquired
Company occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Party delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.9(b)_,
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent agrees that it will
not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless
such settlement provides for a full and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,

 



      
 

 



 

advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim, Legal Proceeding,
arbitration, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following written request by an Indemnified
Party therefor, all reasonable costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with any such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration,
investigation or inquiry, in accordance with the terms of the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Companies and any indemnification agreement between
any Acquired Company and any Indemnified Party, each as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (subject to such Indemnified Party providing an
undertaking to repay such advanced expenses to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, if it is ultimately determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.9_).

 



 

(c) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit
of the Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of directors and
officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof with respect to any action or omission or alleged action or omission
occurring before or at the Effective Time, including with respect to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies an annual premium greater than 300% of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by the Acquired Companies prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " **Maximum Amount** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
above, the Company may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy (the " **Tail Policy**
") prior to the Effective Time, which policy provides the Indemnified Parties
with directors and officers liability insurance for a period ending no
earlier than the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time with respect to
any action or omission or alleged action or omission occurring before or at
the Effective Time, including with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall cause any such Tail Policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_
, _further,_ that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay more than
the Maximum Amount for such Tail Policy.

 



 

(d) In the event any Acquired Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, under any other indemnification arrangement, under the DGCL or
otherwise. This _Section 6.9_ shall survive the Acceptance Time and shall
also survive consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time. This _Section
6.9_ is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns, and shall
be binding on all successors

 



      
 

 



 

and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. _Section 6.9_ may not be
amended, altered or repealed after the Acceptance Time without the prior
written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was an officer
or director of any Acquired Company at any time prior to the Effective Time
shall be deemed to be an " **Indemnified Party**."

 



 

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.12_:

 



 

(i) nothing in this _Section 6.12_ will require any cooperation to the extent
the same would (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the

herein to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach by the Company of
this Agreement (provided that if Parent and Acquisition Sub agree in writing

(ii) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective directors,
officers, employees or representatives shall be required to execute, deliver
or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any
definitive financing document, with respect to any Financing or adopt
resolutions approving the agreements, documents and/or instruments pursuant to
which any Financing is obtained or pledge any collateral with respect to any
Financing the effectiveness of which is not contingent upon the Closing or
that would otherwise be effective prior to the Effective Time;

indemnification obligation, under any agreement or any document related to any
Financing, in each case, until the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company (and in any event,

and arrangers and ratings agencies). Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this Agreement to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation the Offer and the Merger, shall not be conditioned in any respect
on Parents and/or Acquisition Subs receipt of proceeds from, or any other
aspect of, the Financing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition
set forth in "2(e)" of Annex I, as it applies to the Companys obligations
under this _Section 6.12_, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Company
has knowingly and willfully materially breached its obligations under this
_Section 6.12_, and such breach has been the primary and direct cause of the
Financing not being obtained. " **Willful** " means, with respect to any
agreement or covenant, where the breaching party knows an action or omission
is, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a breach of such agreement
or covenant.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Financing Obligations of Parent_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall keep the Company and its counsel reasonably informed of
material developments in respect of the arrangement, documentation and

opportunity for prior review and consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) to all material information (that is not
otherwise publicly available) regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

other marketing materials in connection with the Financing; provided that
failure by the Company to respond after two (2) Business Days of

the Company as to use of such information.

(c) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time if there shall be any Law enacted after the
date hereof and remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of,

Acquisition Sub having accepted for payment any Company Common Stock and
Company Series A Preferred Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of any Offer

Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ unless the notice
of termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ is delivered by Parent to
the Company within ten (10) Business Days following the occurrence of the

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_;

 



 

(g) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty in _Article
4_ or failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement on the part of the Company (subject to _Section 6.12(d_)) shall
have occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions set forth in
clauses " _(2)(d)_ ," " _(2)(e)_ " and " _(2)(f)_ " of _Annex I_ to exist;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 8.1(g)_, if such
a breach is curable by the Company within twenty (20) Business Days of the
date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is
continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then

account of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the
expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period;

 



      
 

 

 _ _

 

 _provided further_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to

Sub shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or failure has had or
would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Acquisition Sub from
consummating the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 8.1(h)_,
if such a breach is curable by Parent within twenty (20) Business Days of the
date the Company gives Parent written notice of such breach and Parent is
continuing to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach,
then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(h)_
on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the
expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ if the Company is in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement (subject to _Section 6.12(d_)) pursuant to _Section
8.1(g)_; or

 



 

(i) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent if Acquisition Sub
fails to commence the Offer in accordance with Section 2.1 on or prior to
November 22, 2017 or if Acquisition Sub fails to consummate the Offer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i)_ shall not be

_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article 9_ shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liabilities
or damages arising out of its knowing or intentional breach of any provision
of this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith or
any fraud, subject only, with respect to any such liabilities of the Company,
to _Section 8.3(b)_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment or pay for
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock following
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the
Merger to be effected following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_, will be deemed to constitute an intentional and material breach
of a covenant of this Agreement. The Parties rights and remedies under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees
payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, and the Company
shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or such other filings
as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, (B)
following the date hereof and prior to the time of the termination of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and (C)
the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 15% in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as 50% for purposes of
this clause "(i)") within twelve (12) months after such termination or the
Company enters into a definitive agreement within twelve (12) months after
such termination to effect an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal
is subsequently consummated; (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_; or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, then in the case of each of clauses
"(i)" through "(iii)," the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent, in
cash at the time specified in the next sentence, a termination fee in the
amount of $7,712,711 (the " **Termination Fee** "). Any Termination Fee shall
be paid: (x) in the case of clause "(i)" of the preceding sentence of this
(b), within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, (y) in the case of clause "(ii)" of
the preceding sentence of this (b), within two (2) Business Days following

preceding sentence of this (b), concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement under _Section 8.1(f)_.

 



 

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable only
once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable
under one or more provisions hereof. Subject to _Section 8.2(b)_, in the
event that Parent shall receive full payment of the Termination Fee, the
receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Offer and the Merger (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent
would not enter into

 



       
 

 



 

this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee when due, Parent shall be entitled to receive interest on such
unpaid Termination Fee and Expenses, commencing on the date that the
Termination Fee or such Expenses became due, at a rate equal to the "prime
rate" as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) and in the event the Parent or Acquisition
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee (or portion thereof), the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

Section 9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination
shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise
the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to comply
in all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a
material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees full performance and payment by Acquisition Sub of each of the
covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by
Acquisition Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach
of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance of any
such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Acquisition Sub shall
also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have
the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available
remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly
against either or both of Parent and Acquisition Sub in the first instance. As
applicable, references in this _Section 9.10_ to "Acquisition Sub" shall also
include the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as
expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts and, in any
action for specific performance, each Party waives the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The Parties further agree that (i)
by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.11_, a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) for
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section 9.11_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.11_ shall require any Party to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any Partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.11_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of

 



      
 

 



 

any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.11_ or anything set forth in
this _Section 9.11_ restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

 



 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES RELATED PARTIES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE FINANCING, ANY
DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR OF SERVICES
WITH RESPECT THERETO). NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN
WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE
FINANCING SOURCES RELATED PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
WITH RESPECT THERETO) WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR
HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Financing Source Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates or their Affiliates respective current, former or future
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members,
controlling persons, stockholders, assignees or representatives (collectively,
the " **Company Related Parties** "), shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Sources Related Parties, and the Company Related Parties hereby
acknowledge that the Financing Sources Related Parties shall be subject to no
liability or claims (whether legal or equitable, arising under contract, tort
or otherwise) by any Company Related Party, in each case arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Financing, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or in connection with the Financing, or the performance of services by
such Financing Sources Related Parties with respect to the foregoing. In no
event shall the Company or any of its respective Affiliates, and the Company
agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to (i) seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages in connection with this Agreement or the
Financing from, any Financing Sources Related Party or (ii) seek to enforce
any commitment in connection with this Agreement or the Financing against,
make any claims for breach of any debt commitment letter in connection with
this Agreement or the Financing against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, or otherwise sue in connection with this Agreement or the Financing, the
Financing Sources Related Parties. No Financing Sources Related Party shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages
of a tortuous nature in connection with this Agreement or the Financing.
Nothing in this Section 9.12 shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations
and liabilities of the parties to any financing commitment letter, engagement
letter, credit agreement or other financing agreement entered into in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein to

 **ANNEX I**

 



 

 ** _CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_**

 



 

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this _Annex I_ is attached (the "
**Agreement** "), Acquisition Sub shall not be obligated to accept for
payment, or, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Acquisition Subs obligation to
pay for or return the tendered Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay
for any Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore
accepted for payment or paid for), unless (i) there shall have been validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Series A Preferred Stock that, considered together with all other shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock (if any)
beneficially owned by Parent and its controlled Affiliates (excluding any
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been received),
represent one more than 50% of the sum of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer,
plus (y) solely with respect to any shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock
that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, without duplication with respect to Company Series
A Preferred Stock that have converted into the right to receive shares of
Company Common Stock), the total number of shares of Company Common Stock into
which such outstanding shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock are
convertible, plus (z) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that
the Company would be required to issue upon conversion, settlement, exchange
or exercise of all options, warrants, rights or securities outstanding at the
time of the expiration of the Offer that are convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into share of Company Common Stock (whether then outstanding or
for which the conversion, settlement, exchange or exercise date has already
occurred, but in any event without duplication) (such condition, the "
**Common Stock Minimum Condition**"), (ii) there shall have been validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock
that, considered together with all other shares of Company Series A Preferred
Stock (if any) beneficially owned by Parent and its controlled Affiliates
(excluding any shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been received), represent one
more than 50% of the sum of the total number of shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time (but, for the avoidance of doubt, without duplication with
respect to Company Series A Preferred Stock that have converted into the right
to receive shares of Company Common Stock) (such condition, the " **Preferred
Stock Minimum Condition**", and together with the Common Stock Minimum
Condition, the " **Minimum Condition** "), and (iii) the waiting period (and
any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated.

 



 

(2) In addition and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition
Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act

 



      
 

 



 

(relating to Acquisition Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Series A Preferred Stock validly tendered (and not
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or
paid for) if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Expiration Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing
at the Expiration Date:

 



 

(a) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

 



 

(b) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits, or issued a final and nonappealable Order, or taken any
other action, that is in effect and permanently restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits, in each case, the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or imposes a
Burdensome Restraint;

 



 

(c) any Governmental Entity shall have instituted any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or Legal Proceeding (which remains pending
at what would otherwise be the Acceptance Time) before any United States court
or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction seeking to restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(d) (i) other than the representations set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii)
below, all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the Agreement shall not have been true and correct (in each case, disregarding
all qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or qualification) as of
the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and
as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation
and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such
earlier date), except where the failure of any such representation or warranty
to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ (Due
Organization and Good Standing) (solely to the extent relating to the
Company), _Section 4.16_ (Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement) and
_Section 4.21_ (Brokers) shall not have been true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date); and (iii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_ (Capitalization)
shall not have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such earlier date), except
for any _de minimis_ inaccuracies;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects
with the obligations, agreements and covenants required to be performed by it
under the Agreement (subject to _Section 6.12(d)_);

 



 

(f) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent dated as of the Expiration
Date a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior executive
officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth in the
foregoing _clauses (2)(d)_ and _(2)(e)_ have been satisfied as of
immediately prior to the Expiration Date; or

 



 

(g) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing any event, change, effect or development that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and
Acquisition Sub; _provided_ that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent
and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company, which
may be granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any
time and from time to time. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this
_Annex I_ shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement to which
this _Annex I_ is attached.
