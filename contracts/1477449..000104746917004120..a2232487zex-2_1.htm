reporting (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exchange Act</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>")), that complies
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and has been designed by Parent's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent's internal control over financial reporting is
effective for purposes of Rules&nbsp;13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and Parent is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since
December&nbsp;31, 2016, there has been no change in Parent's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent's internal
control over financial reporting. </FONT></P>

pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of proceeds available under, the
Debt Financing contained therein redacted) (collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Debt Commitment Letter</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have agreed, subject
only to the Financing Conditions set forth therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt financing set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the cash component of the aggregate consideration payable in the Merger. Such executed Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and no amendment, termination or modification is contemplated (it being understood that neither the exercise of "market flex" provisions under the fee letter, nor the joinder or addition of
any Financing Sources to the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be
deemed an amendment or modification). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement of any kind relating to the financing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that reduces the amount of, or could affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date. Assuming (i)&nbsp;the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, Parent will have sufficient funds to satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date. The commitments
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of creditors and general principles of equity. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all fees and
other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date other than the Financing Conditions. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that, subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Sections&nbsp;8.1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>8.3</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, (i)&nbsp;any of the Financing
Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii)&nbsp;the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that
makes any of the assumptions, or the representations or warranties of Parent, in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger
is not subject to any financing condition. </FONT></P>

event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative will reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i)&nbsp;the funds in the Expense
Fund, and (ii)&nbsp;the amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the

their obligation to promptly pay such losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no
event will the Stockholder Representative be required to

obligations of the Company Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this Section. The
