 2.2 _ Payment for Securities._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or such other reputable bank, trust or administrator company reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the consideration in connection with the Merger (other than with respect to compensatory payments for Tax purposes) (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. 

  

 (b) _ Procedures for Surrender._ 

    

 (i) _ Certificates._ As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Time), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Capital Stock represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which shares of Company Capital Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ at the Effective Time, and who has not returned a Stock Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent prior to the Closing Date: (A) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (a " _Stock Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_ and, if required, an indemnification agreement) in exchange for payment of the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_ and, if required, an indemnification agreement) to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a Stock Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Stock Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_ for each share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of such 

   

      

   

consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificate. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_, except for Certificates
representing shares of Company Capital Stock held by Dissenting Stockholders,
which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair
value of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with and to the
extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

 (ii) _ Book-Entry Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated shares of Company Capital Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the Effective Time), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares who has not returned a Stock Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent prior to the Closing Date: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_. Payment of consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_, except for Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Capital Stock held by Dissenting Stockholders, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. 

    

 (c) _ Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender such holder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ in exchange for the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_, or in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, the right to perfect such holder\'s right to receive payment pursuant to the DGCL. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability._ Any portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) and shares of Parent Stock made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry 

  

      

  

Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the consideration set forth in _Section
2.1_ in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of such consideration,
without interest, in respect of such holder\'s surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_.
Any consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates
will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the consideration
made available to the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company Capital Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation upon demand.

   

 (e) _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger and fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. 

  

 (f) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in their reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require the owner of any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver an indemnification agreement in such form and containing such substance reasonably acceptable to Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, indemnifying Parent and/or the Paying Agent against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

  

 2.3 _ Dissenting Shares._ 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Capital Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder\'s right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into, and shall represent only, the right to receive (upon surrender in accordance with _Section 2.2_) the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1_, without interest. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL (and of any similar demand purportedly made under other applicable Law) and (ii) the 

  

      

  

opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands other than as
required by Law or pursuant to a final court order. Prior to the Closing Date,
any written communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company
Capital Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and the Company shall consider in good faith any input from Parent
with regards to such written communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company makes any
payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with _Section 2.1_ (" _Excess Dissenting Share Payments_ "),
Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount of such Excess Dissenting
Share Payments in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ hereof.

  

  

 2.4 _ Treatment of Company Options._ 

  

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each In-the-Money Option then outstanding (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the excess of the cash value of the Common Per Share Mixed Consideration (based on the Parent Stock Value) over the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Option, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such In-the-Money Option, to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_, and (ii) each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Option will be cancelled and forfeited for no consideration. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the former holder of any Company Option shall have no further rights with respect to Company Options, other than the right to receive payment in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_. No later than Parent\'s first ordinary payroll payment date that is at least three (3) Business Days after the Closing, Parent shall cause to be paid to each former holder of Company Options who has delivered to the Company and/or Parent a duly executed Option Letter of Transmittal on or prior to the Closing Date the cash consideration to be paid to such former holder of Company Options pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ as set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule (less the amount to be deposited into the escrow accounts pursuant to _Section 2.8_), which shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to applicable Tax withholding. From time to time following the Closing, Parent shall promptly cause to be paid to each former holder of Company Options who delivers to the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent a duly executed Option Letter of Transmittal following the Closing Date the cash consideration to be paid to such former holder of Company Options pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ as set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule (less the amount deposited into the escrow accounts pursuant to _Section 2.8_), which shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to applicable Tax withholding. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary or appropriate (including obtaining any required consents) to effect the transactions described in this _Section 2.4_, and to ensure that, following the Effective Time, no former holder of a Company Option shall have any right to acquire any Company Capital Stock or to receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company Equity Plan, except the right to receive a payment with respect thereto as provided in this _Section 2.4_.

 (a) To the extent not exercised by the holder thereof prior to the Closing, immediately prior to the Closing each of the Sante Warrant, the Abundant Warrant, the Foundation Warrant, the Cambia Warrant and the Claypool Warrant shall be deemed to have been automatically exercised by means of a net issuance and converted into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Warrant Value (as defined in the Sante Warrant, the Abundant Warrant, the Foundation Warrant, the Cambia Warrant or the Claypool Warrant, as applicable) at the time of such deemed conversion by the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Sante Warrant, the Abundant Warrant, the Foundation Warrant, the Cambia Warrant or the Claypool Warrant, as applicable). 

  

 (b) At the Closing but immediately prior to the conversion of securities pursuant to _Section 2.1_, BBH shall sell to Parent and Parent shall purchase from BBH all of BBH\'s right, title and interest in and to the BBH Warrant, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than restrictions on transfers of securities under applicable U.S. state and federal securities Laws). In consideration thereof, at the Closing, Parent shall pay to BBH an aggregate amount equal to (i) the difference between (A) the price per share of Common Stock that would have been payable to the Common Stockholders in accordance with the Company\'s Organizational Documents (taking into account amounts necessary to make payments to Company Optionholders in accordance with _Section 2.4_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the Series I Consideration) assuming the BBH Warrant and the BBH QP Warrant had been exercised prior to Closing _minus_ (B) One Cent (.01) _multiplied by_  (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the BBH Warrant was convertible immediately prior to the Closing (calculated on a fully diluted basis, including as if all Company Options were outstanding); _provided_ that such amount shall be paid (i) 85.23% in cash (the " _BBH Warrant Cash Consideration_ " and (ii) 14.77% in shares of Parent Stock (valuing each share of Parent Stock at the Parent Stock Value) (such number of shares of Parent Stock, the " _BBH Warrant Share Consideration_ ").

 (c) At the Closing but immediately prior to the conversion of securities pursuant to _Section 2.1_, BBH QP shall sell to Parent and Parent shall purchase from BBH QP all of BBH QP\'s right, title and interest in and to the BBH QP Warrant, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than restrictions on transfers of securities under applicable U.S. state and federal securities Laws). In consideration thereof, at the Closing, Parent shall pay to BBH QP an aggregate amount equal to (i) the difference between (A) the price per share of Common Stock that would have been payable to the Common Stockholders in accordance with the Company\'s Organizational Documents (taking into account amounts necessary to make payments to Company Optionholders 

  

      

  

in accordance with _Section 2.4_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking
into account the Series I Consideration) assuming the BBH Warrant and the BBH
QP Warrant had been exercised prior to Closing _minus_ (B) One Cent (.01)
_multiplied by_  (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the BBH
QP Warrant was convertible immediately prior to the Closing (calculated on a
fully diluted basis, including as if all Company Options were outstanding);
_provided_ that such amount shall be paid (i) 85.23% in cash (the " _BBH QP
Warrant Cash Consideration_ " and (ii) 14.77% in shares of Parent Stock
(valuing each share of Parent Stock at the Parent Stock Value) (such number of
shares of Parent Stock, the " _BBH QP Warrant Share Consideration_ "). BBH QP
represents and warrants to Parent that (i) it is (and immediately prior to the
share purchase contemplated by this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be) the sole

to, and full power and authority to sell, assign and transfer such BBH QP
Warrant, free and clear of all Encumbrances; (b) it is duly incorporated or

other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity);
and (e) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by
the undersigned of its obligations hereunder do not conflict with, result in a

The Estimated Cash Amount shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.9_ hereof. The Estimated Closing Certificate shall be accompanied by a schedule showing the Company\'s detailed calculation of the items set forth thereon, including, for the avoidance of doubt, detailed calculations of (A) the LTIP Payment; and (B) the Series D/E Payment.

as additional consideration in the Merger an amount in cash (the "

Neither Parent nor the Company shall have any obligation to provide information or access to information, materials or persons if doing so would reasonably be expected to (i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company\'s business, (ii) result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of any trade secrets or (iii) violate any Law or the terms of any applicable Contract to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is party. If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with any of Parent\'s calculations set forth in the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent disagreeing with such calculations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Objection Notice shall include only objections based on whether (A) the amounts set forth on the Closing Statement were prepared in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement or (B) there were mathematical errors in the computation of any amount set forth on the Closing Statement. Any Objection Notice shall specify those items or amounts with which the Stockholder Representative disagrees, together with a detailed written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth the Stockholder Representative\'s calculation, based on such objections, of the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash and the Working Capital, and based thereon a calculation of the Cash Amount. To the extent not set forth in the Objection Notice, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with Parent\'s calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and such amounts shall be final and binding on the parties. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty-day period, then the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding on the parties. 

  

 (c) If an Objection Notice is timely delivered pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the value of the disputed items or amounts, and any discussions relating thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule(s) and evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the parties to this Agreement. If, during such period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on all disputed items, they shall promptly thereafter mutually engage and submit such dispute to an Independent 

  

      

  

Accounting Firm for final and binding resolution. The Independent Accounting
Firm (i) shall consider only those items or amounts disputed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Objection Notice which remain in dispute;
(ii) shall not assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than
the greatest value for such item or amount assigned by the
Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or
less than the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by the
Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand;
and (iii) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent
Accounting Firm\'s determination will be based solely on presentations by the
Stockholder Representative and Parent which are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis
of independent review) and the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver to the Stockholder
Representative and Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within
thirty (30) days of its retention) a written report setting forth its
determination of the amounts in dispute. Such report shall be final and
binding on the parties. The cost of such review and report shall be borne (and
paid) by the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party. For example, if closing accounts receivable is the only disputed item,
and Parent claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the
amount determined by the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the
independent accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the cost of such review and report
will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Stockholder Representative and
40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Parent.

  

 (d) If the Cash Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, is less than the Estimated Cash Amount, then, within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Cash Amount, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Parent the amount of such difference from the Adjustment Escrow Account; _provided_ , that if the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to cover the difference, then each Stockholder shall pay such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the shortfall within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Cash Amount to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent. If the Cash Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, is greater than the Estimated Cash Amount, then the amount of such excess shall be paid within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Cash Amount by Parent (i) to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders and (ii) to the Company Optionholders through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to applicable Tax withholding, in each case based on percentages specified on the Closing Consideration Schedule. 

  

  

 2.10 _ Withholding Rights._ Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the Treasury Regulations or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any compensatory payments for Tax purposes payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary subject to applicable Tax withholding. Other than with respect to compensatory payments for Tax purposes or withholding arising from Section 3406 of the Code solely as a result of failure to provide either a Form W-9 or applicable Form W-8, (i) Parent shall notify the applicable Stockholder subject to withholding of any amounts that Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent intend to withhold from any 

        

payments hereunder and provide the Stockholder Representative with reasonable
support for the basis on which such party intends to withhold under applicable
Law, and (ii) the parties shall cooperate with each other, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, to minimize or eliminate any
such withholding as provided hereunder.

ARTICLE V. 
 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

  

 Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports (other than risk factor and forward-looking statement disclosure in such SEC Reports), Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows: 

  

 5.1 _ Organization of Parent and Merger Sub._ Parent and Merger Sub are corporations duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and have all organizational power and authority required to own, lease and license their assets and properties and carry on their businesses as presently conducted. Parent and Merger Sub are each duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the assets and properties owned, leased or licensed by them or the nature of their businesses makes such qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and discharge its obligations under, this Agreement. 

   

 5.2 _ Capitalization._ 

  

  

 (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 100,000,000 shares of Parent Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value (" _Parent Preferred Stock_ "). As of June 16, 2017, (a) 54,731,753 shares of Parent Stock were issued and outstanding, (b) options to purchase 8,909,541 shares of Parent Stock were outstanding, (c) 137,043 Parent restricted stock units were outstanding and (d) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.

Except as set forth above, as of June 16, 2017, there are no outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate Parent or any of its subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. 

  

      

  

 (b) Parent is the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. 

  

  

 5.3 _ Parent Stock._ The shares of Parent Stock issuable in the Merger, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have been validly issued and will be fully paid and non-assessable and the issuance thereof will not be subject to any pre-emptive rights. The issuance of the Parent Stock pursuant to this Agreement will not be integrated with the issuance of any other equity interest under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, in either case so as to subject such offering, issuance, or sale of the Parent Stock to the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Assuming the accuracy of the statements made by the Stockholders in the Accredited Investor Certifications, the offer, sale, and issuance of the Parent Stock pursuant to this Agreement will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and will have been registered or qualified (or are exempt from registration and qualification) under the registration, permit, or qualification requirements of all applicable state securities laws. 

  

 5.4 _ Interim Operations of Merger Sub._ Merger Sub was formed by Parent solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and has engaged in no other business activities other than those relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub has no liabilities or obligations other than those incident to its formation or pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party. 

  

 5.5 _ Authorization._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant hereto, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform their obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by Parent\'s Board of Directors. Except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which they are to be parties and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and is, and upon execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements to which Parent and/or Merger Sub are or will be parties, each of such Ancillary Agreements will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and/or Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, in each case, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and (b) the general principles of equity, regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. 

  

 (b) The Board of Directors of Merger Sub, by written consent duly adopted prior to the date hereof, has resolved (x) that this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and the stockholder of Merger Sub, (y) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (z) submitted this Agreement for adoption by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has duly approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

  

 5.6 _ Consents and Approvals._ Other than (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (b) the applicable requirements of the HSR Act, no approval of any Governmental Authority or other Person is required to be made or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the 

        

Ancillary Agreements to which Parent and/or Merger Sub is a party or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for
Approvals which if not obtained would not have a material adverse effect on
Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and discharge its obligations under, this Agreement.

  

 5.7 _ No Conflict or Violation._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by Parent or Merger Sub, does or will (a) violate, breach or be in conflict with any provisions of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (b) with or without the passage of time, the giving of notice or both, violate, breach, result in a default under or be in conflict with any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party; or (c) violate any Law or any Order to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject, which in the case of clauses (b) or (c) would have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and discharge its obligations under, this Agreement. 

   

 5.8 _ Parent SEC Reports_. As of the time filed with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing, then on the date of such filing) none of the registration statements, proxy statements, and other statements, reports, schedules, forms, exhibits and other documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC (" _Parent SEC Reports_ ") contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 5.9 _ Parent Financial Statements_. The audited and unaudited financial statements of Parent (including the related notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Reports (x) are based on the books and records of the Parent; (y) fairly present in all material respects the financial condition of the Parent as of the dates therein indicated and the results of operations and cash flows of the Parent for the periods therein specified (subject, in the case of any unaudited balance sheet, to customary year-end adjustments); and (z) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby (except any unaudited balance sheet does not contain footnotes required by GAAP or as may be indicated in the notes thereto). 

   

 5.10 _ Internal Control over Financial Reporting_. Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")), that complies with the requirements of the Exchange Act and has been designed by Parent\'s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting is effective for purposes of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and Parent is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2016, there has been no change in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting. 

  

 5.11 _ Litigation_. There is no Action before any Governmental Authority pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or Merger Sub, or affecting any of their properties or assets, which would have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and discharge their obligations under, this Agreement. 

  

 5.12 _ Compliance with Laws_. Parent is not in breach or default of any provisions of its Organizational Documents. Parent and its officers and directors (in their capacities as such) are in compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to the Parent, except where failure to be in compliance would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

        

 5.13 _ Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the executed commitment letter and related exhibits, schedules, annexes and term sheets, dated as of the date of this Agreement, together with the related fee letter (solely in the case of the fee letter, with only the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of proceeds available under, the Debt Financing contained therein redacted) (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have agreed, subject only to the Financing Conditions set forth therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt financing set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated hereby, including the cash component of the aggregate consideration payable in the Merger. Such executed Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner on or prior to the date of this Agreement and no amendment, termination or modification is contemplated (it being understood that neither the exercise of "market flex" provisions under the fee letter, nor the joinder or addition of any Financing Sources to the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be deemed an amendment or modification). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement of any kind relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that reduces the amount of, or could affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, Parent will have sufficient funds to satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date. The commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of creditors and general principles of equity. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date other than the Financing Conditions. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.3_ , (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions, or the representations or warranties of Parent, in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. 

  

 5.14 _ No Material Adverse Effect_. Between March 31, 2017 and the date of this Agreement, there has been no Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 5.15 _ Intellectual Property_. Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of
others in any material respect. To Parent\'s actual knowledge, no party has
materially infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property owned by or exclusively licensed to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries. There is no material pending, or to Parent\'s actual knowledge,
threatened, action, suit, proceeding or claim by others (A) alleging that
Parent is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property of others, or (B) challenging Parent\'s or its subsidiaries rights
in or to, or the validity, enforceability, scope or ownership of, any Parent
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Parent or its subsidiaries.

   

 (b) The Parent has complied at all times with all applicable Laws, and relevant agreements to which the Parent is a party, regarding the collection, retention, use, acquisition, recording, storage, distribution, disposal, transfer, disclosure, processing and security of Personal Information, including, in each case, by obtaining all consent from, and giving all notices to, the Person subject of Personal Information to the fullest extent necessary.

The Parent has implemented and maintained a privacy policy regarding the collection, retention, use, acquisition, recording, storage, distribution, disposal, transfer, disclosure, processing and security of Personal Information in connection with the operation of its business and (i) the Parent\'s privacy practices are and have been in compliance with all such privacy policies at the time such privacy policy was in effect, (ii) the Parent\'s information security practices are and have been in compliance with any information security statements in its privacy policies at the time each such privacy policy was in effect and (iii) the Parent has posted such privacy policy in a clear and conspicuous location on all websites and any mobile applications owned or operated by or on behalf of the Parent. No Person (including any Governmental Authority) has made any written or, to the actual knowledge of the Parent, oral claim or commenced any written or, to the actual knowledge of the Parent, oral Action, and, to the actual knowledge of the Parent, no claim or Action is threatened (y) alleging a violation of any Person\'s privacy or confidentiality rights under the Parent\'s privacy policies or applicable Law or (z) with respect to the security, use, transfer or disclosure of Personal Information specifically. The Parent has fulfilled in compliance with applicable Law all requests from the subjects of Personal Information to access, remove or update such Personal Information stored by or on behalf of the Parent. Neither this Agreement, nor any Ancillary Agreement to which the Parent is a party, nor the consummation of the Transactions will violate any of the Parent\'s applicable privacy policies as they currently exist or as they existed at any time during which any Personal Information was collected or obtained. The Parent has established and implemented policies, programs, procedures that conform with applicable industry practices and all requirements of Law, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of Personal Information in its possession, custody or control against unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse. To the actual knowledge of the Parent, the Parent has not experienced any loss, damage, or unauthorized access, disclosure, use or breach of security of any Personal Information in its possession, custody or control, or otherwise held or processed on its behalf. 

  

 (c) To the extent that the Parent receives, processes, transmits or stores any Cardholder Data, the Parent has implemented information security procedures, processes and systems that have at all times met or exceeded all applicable Laws related to the collection, storage, processing and transmission of Cardholder Data, including those established by applicable Governmental Authorities, and the Payment Card Industry Standards Council (including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). 

  

       

 5.16 _ Tax_. Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect: 

  

  

 (a) Parent has duly and timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities all income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions to file such Tax Returns). All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. 

  

 (b) All material Taxes due and owing by Parent on or before the date hereof have been timely paid (or adequate reserves have been established therefor). 

  

 (c) There are no assessments or adjustments relating to any Liability in respect of Taxes of Parent pending against Parent for any period with respect to which Parent has received written notice. 

  

  

 5.17 _ No Brokers_. Except for Piper Jaffray and Co., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, none of Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of their respective representatives or Affiliates has employed or made any agreement with any broker, finder or similar agent or any Person which will result in the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any finder\'s fee, brokerage fees or commission or similar payment in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

 6.5 _ Accredited Investor Certifications_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as consideration in the Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be transferred in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Stockholder shall be entitled to receive Parent Stock in connection with the Merger only if such Stockholder is a Designated Nonaccredited Investor or (a) is an accredited investor within the meaning of SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect, under the Securities Act and (b) provides an executed accredited investor questionnaire in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (an " _Accredited Investor Questionnaire_ ") no later than June 27, 2017 (the " _Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), mail or otherwise deliver to each Stockholder and each holder of a warrant to purchase Company Capital Stock set forth on _Section 4.2(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule an Accredited Investor Questionnaire to be completed by such Stockholder and returned to Parent by the Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline.

 6.6 _ Warrants._ The Company shall, as promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), deliver to each holder of a warrant to purchase Company Capital Stock set forth on _Section 6.6_ of the Disclosure Schedule a notice of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required pursuant to the terms of each such warrant.

 6.8 _ Tax Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Tax Returns._ 

    

 (i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared or timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of any member of the Company Group that are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company Group due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practices of such member, except as required by applicable law. 

  

 (ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for each member of the Company Group for any periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date and all Tax Returns for the Company Group for any Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with 

   

      

   

the most recent Tax Returns of the applicable member of the Company Group.
Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax
Returns, Parent shall provide the Stockholder Representative with drafts of
such Tax Returns. The parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any
differences and to the extent such differences have not been resolved,
the principles of _Section 2.9_ shall apply thereto. Parent shall make any
changes to the Tax Returns as finally determined pursuant to the preceding
sentence and shall file such Tax Returns consistent therewith. For purposes
of this Agreement, the portion of Taxes payable for any Straddle Period
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be (i) in the case of Property
Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of
the Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date, except
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time
basis.

  

 (iii) Except as specifically provided in _Section 6.8(b)_, neither Parent or the Surviving Corporation, nor any of their Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall cause or permit the Surviving Corporation to) file, amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except as required by a Taxing Authority or applicable Law, without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (provided that it shall not be considered unreasonable for the Stockholder Representative to withhold consent if such filing, amendment, refiling, or otherwise modification could be expected to result in liability to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall make an election under Section 338 or 336 of the Code (or similar provisions of state, local or foreign law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall permit the Surviving Corporation to) (i) initiate or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or program with any Taxing Authority with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) on the Closing Date after the Closing, take any action outside of the ordinary course of business other than an action explicitly contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) make or change any Tax election of the Company that has retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

    

 (b) _ Cooperation on Tax Matters._ 

    

 (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest (as defined below). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information which may be reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making appropriate persons available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or Stockholder Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority and (ii) to give to the other Person reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Person so requests, the 

   

      

   

Surviving Corporation or the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Person to take possession of such books and records.

   

 (ii) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representative further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 

    

 (c) _ Transfer Taxes._ All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by one-half by Parent and one-half by the Stockholders. Each Person required by applicable law agrees to file, or cause to be filed, in a timely manner all necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer Taxes. 

  

 (d) _ Tax Refunds._ All Tax refunds that are received by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which any of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries become entitled relating to any Tax period for which any of the Company Equityholders are responsible to indemnify Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Company Equityholders (excluding any refund or credit attributable to a carryback of any loss incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period) and the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries, shall pay such amount (net of reasonable expenses (including Taxes) incurred to obtain such refunds or credits) to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders, or to the Company Optionholders through the payroll system of Parent or its Subsidiary, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Subject to the principles of the provisions of _Section 6.8(e)_ below with respect to such refunds, to the extent any such Tax refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Governmental Authority, the Company Equityholders shall promptly repay the amount of such Tax refund or credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority as a result of actions or omissions of the Company Equityholders, to Parent. 

  

 (e) _ Tax Contests._ 

    

 (i) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly notify each other in writing upon receipt by such party or any of their respective Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign audits, examinations, claims, assessments or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ ") for which such party is entitled to seek, or is seeking or intends to seek, indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding  _Article VII_, subject to the consent rights of any insurer or any other limitations in the RandW Insurance Policy, to the extent the Company Equityholders may be held liable for any Taxes under the provisions of this Agreement (and taking into account the RandW Insurance Policy), then: 

    

 (A) the Stockholder Representative shall have the right, in good faith, to control and to represent the interests of any member of the Company Group in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its own choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall be entitled to participate at its expense in or with respect to any such Tax Contest. The Stockholder 

    

      

    

Representative shall have the right to settle or compromise, or agree to
settle or compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any Tax Contest for any Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, no such settlement, compromise or agreement
shall be effectuated without Parent\'s prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

 (B) Parent and Stockholder Representative shall have the right, in good faith, to jointly control and to represent the interests of the Company in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither party may settle or compromise, or agree to settle or compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of both parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

     

 (f) _ No duplication._ This Section 6.8 shall be interpreted as to avoid duplication. 

  

  

 6.9 _ Indemnification of Officers and Directors._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent acknowledges that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase tail insurance coverage for the Company\'s directors and officers in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). The cost of obtaining the DandO Tail Policy shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by the Company. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each current or former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and personal representatives, and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any such current or former director or officer and his or her heirs and personal representatives may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or under any Contract or applicable Law. 

  

 (d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

withheld, conditioned or delayed). After such initial press release is
disseminated, the Company and Parent will consult with each other and will
mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to
the transactions and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such
public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements;
_provided,_ that (i) Parent may make any public statement to the press,
analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies, proxy advisory firms or those
attending industry conferences or Parent conference calls, so long as such
statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company (or
individually, if approved by the other party) and (ii) the foregoing shall not
apply with respect to any press releases issued by Parent with respect to the
Debt Financing or any statements to any potential lender or investor in
connection with the Debt Financing.

  

  

 6.11 _ Stockholder Confidentiality._ As an owner of Company Capital Stock, each Stockholder has had access to and contributed to information and materials of a highly sensitive nature (including Confidential Information) of the businesses of the Company. As additional consideration for the Merger consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and by executing a Stock Letter of Transmittal, each Stockholder agrees that unless such Stockholder first secures the written consent of an authorized representative of Parent, such Stockholder shall not (except on behalf of Parent or pursuant to the terms of such Stockholder\'s employment agreement with the Company or Parent) use for himself, herself, itself or anyone else, and shall not disclose to others, any Confidential Information relating to the business of the Company, except (a) to the extent necessary to comply with the Law, a Governmental Authority or a valid court order of a court with competent jurisdiction, in which event such Stockholder shall so notify Parent as promptly as is practicable (if possible, prior to making such disclosure) and shall seek confidential treatment of such information; (b) to its banks, auditors and attorneys and similar professionals ( _provided_ , that such Stockholder shall be liable in the event that any such permitted recipients disclose any information that such Stockholder would be prohibited from disclosing pursuant to this provision); or (c) in order to enforce its rights pursuant to this Agreement.

and (y) none of the Company Equityholders, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, and (z) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall be required to incur any other cost or expense except to
the extent such cost or expense (i) is reimbursed by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to or at the Closing or (ii) solely
in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, is contingent upon the
Closing. The Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates may share non-
public or confidential information regarding the Company and its businesses
with any Financing Source Related Party, and that Parent, its Affiliates and
such Financing Source Related Party may share such information with potential
financing sources in connection with any marketing efforts (including any
syndication) in connection with the Debt Financing, provided that
the recipients of such information agree to customary confidentiality
arrangements no less comprehensive than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates obtained
by Parent and its Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to this _Section
6.17_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may disclose such information in any
offering memorandum or other offering document for the Debt Financing or as
may be required under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Parent agrees
that (i) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with cooperation required by this _Section 6.17_; and (ii) Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing or any assistance or activities provided in connection therewith
(other than arising from (x) the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' or
other representatives\' fraud, willful misconduct,
intentional misrepresentation or gross negligence or (y) material
misstatements or omissions in written historical information prepared by the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection with the Debt Financing).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) this _Section 6.17(a)_ shall
be deemed to have been complied with so long as the Company has provided
cooperation as is consistent with the scope and substance required pursuant
to this clause (a) in respect of the Debt Financing contemplated under the
Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) and (ii) this
_Section 6.17(a)_ shall be deemed to have been complied with by the Company
and its Subsidiaries for purposes of the condition set forth _in Section
8.3(b)_ unless the Parent has failed to obtain the Debt Financing as a direct
result of non-compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 6.17(a)_.

  

      

  

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things that are within Parent\'s or any of its Affiliates\' control necessary to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, provided that it is understood and agreed that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and amend titles, allocations and the fee arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities; (ii) participation by senior management of Parent in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) satisfying (or obtaining a waiver of) on a timely basis all Financing Conditions that are within Parent\'s or any of its Affiliate\'s control; (iv) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or otherwise not materially less favorable to Parent (including as to conditionality and timing) than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex" provisions related thereto); and (v) drawing the full amount of the Debt Financing, in the event that the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.3_ and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding would be satisfied. Parent shall give the Company prompt (and in any event within two Business Days) notice of any breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent or its Affiliates become aware (provided, that other than informing the Company of such breach, Parent and Merger Sub will be under no obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client privilege); and (vi) fully enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Documents to cause the Financing Sources, lenders and other Persons committing to provide the Debt Financing to comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Documents to fund the Debt Financing at Closing. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document except for substitutions and replacements as explicitly permitted herein. 

   

 (c) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, notify the Company and shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative debt or equity sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms set forth herein and otherwise on terms not less favorable in any material respect taken as a whole than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (as reasonably determined by Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (including any fee letter (subject to customary redactions)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with all or any portion of the Debt Financing. In the event any alternative financing source is required to be obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.17(c)_ or is permitted to be amended pursuant to  _Section 6.17(b)_, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the alternate source or additional sources, as applicable, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter of the alternative financing source or any amended commitment letter, as applicable, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the alternative financing source or any amended fee letter, as applicable, and (iv) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Sources" shall be deemed to include the alternative financing sources or any financing sources permitted under the commitment letters. Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive 

  

      

  

any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
Documents that would (A) add new conditions precedent or expand any of the
conditions precedent set forth therein as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (unless such new or expanded conditions precedent could not
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the availability
of all or a portion of the Debt Financing), (B) reasonably be expected to
impair, delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Debt
Financing, (C) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments
under the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement to be
funded on the Closing Date (except as set forth in any "flex provisions" in
the Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent resulting from an increase in the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount, if any revolving
facility or increased term loan is available to satisfy such amounts
or original issue discount), or (D) otherwise adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or delay the Closing. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of any
amendment, modification or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating
to the Financing, including any material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to
the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing
to be funded at Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing
and/or the definitive documentation related thereto), including upon its
becoming aware of any breach of the Debt Commitment Letter by any party
thereto.

  

  

 For the avoidance of doubt, failure to obtain all or any portion of the Financing (or any alternative financing) shall not in and of itself relieve or alter the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms set forth herein (such obligation being subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.3_ ). 

   

 6.18 _ NYSE Listing._ Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 6.19 _ RandW Insurance Policy._ Parent and the Company agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to take all actions that are reasonably necessary to cause the RandW Insurance Policy to be in effect at or prior to the Closing. 

  

 6.20 _ Continuation of Benefits._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent agrees that for twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, each employee of the Company Group as of the Effective Time shall, while such employee remains employed (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), receive employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits of similarly situated employees of Parent excluding for comparability purposes any bonus, equity or equity-based awards; _provided_ , _however_ , that, through December 31, 2017, subject to applicable Law, Parent shall continue to maintain and make available benefits to the Continuing Employees under each Employee Benefit Plan set forth on _Section 6.20_ of the Disclosure Schedule at the same level and pursuant to the same terms as in effect with respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may instead elect to provide such benefits through alternative means if Parent reasonably determines it to be appropriate so long as such alternative means does not increase the costs to the Continuing Employees of such benefits and such benefits are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the benefits previously provided. In addition, each Continuing Employee shall, as of the Effective Time, receive full credit for service with the Company Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and vacation entitlement under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent in which 

  

      

  

such Continuing Employee participates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any equity awards or incentives granted after the Effective
Time) to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company Group
prior to the Effective Time under comparable Employee Benefit Plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the duplication
of any benefits for the same period of service.

  

 (b) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which a Continuing Employee participates, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) to be waived for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs any eligibility waiting periods or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare benefit plan of the Company Group immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent\'s obligations under this clause (ii) shall be subject to its receipt of all necessary information, from either the Company Group or such Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by such Continuing Employee. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.20_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 6.20_ shall create such rights in any such persons or any other third party. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Employee Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time, or (iii) amend or establish any Employee Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements. 

  

  

 6.21 _ Notices of Certain Events._ During the Interim Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of: 

  

  

 (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority delivered in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (c) any Action commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against the Company that relates to the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (d) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the Company contained in this Agreement of which the Company has Knowledge that would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_; and 

   

 (e) any material inaccuracy in _Schedule J_ of which the Company has Knowledge. 

  

  

 No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (x) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement or (y) determining whether any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ has been satisfied. 

        

 6.22 _ Further Assurances._ Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, the parties agree: (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (b) to execute any documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, and (c) to cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing. 

  

 6.23 _ Legal Representation._ All communications involving attorney-client confidences among the Company Group and Ropes and Gray LLP in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders (and not the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent) and may be controlled by the Stockholder Representative. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent) will be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Pre-Merger Communications_ "), and none of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or Affiliates (including Parent) will be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Ropes and Gray LLP with respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute property of the client, only the Stockholders and their Affiliates will hold such property rights and (c) Ropes and Gray LLP will not have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Merger Communications or files pertaining to the Pre-Merger Communications to the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates (including Parent) by reason of any attorney-client relationship between any of Ropes and Gray LLP and the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Surviving Corporation or their subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Stockholders, on the other hand, Parent may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Pre-Merger Communications to such third party or waive such privilege if desired in connection with resolving such dispute. In the event that Parent is legally required or requested by governmental order or otherwise (any such request or order, a " _Legal Request_ ") to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Pre-Merger Communications, Parent shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Pre-Merger Communications to the extent necessary to comply with any such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal Request, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing (prior to the disclosure by Parent of any Pre-Merger Communications to the extent practicable) so that the Stockholder Representative can seek a protective order and Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the Stockholder Representative) to assist therewith. 

  

 6.24 _ Earn Out._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to assign the Company\'s right to receive the earn out payment (the " _Earn Out_ ") set forth in Section 2 of Schedule 7 of the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of the Entire Issued Share Capital of the Best Doctors Insurance Group, among Best Doctors Inc., Tamsin (Holdings) Limited and Asia Bright (H.K.) Limited, to a newly created entity owned by the Stockholders in the same proportion to their ownership of the Company without Liability to Parent or the Company Group. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Earn Out is assigned to a newly created entity owned by the Stockholders prior to the Closing Date, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any right to the Earn Out, it being understood that all payments of the Earn Out received shall be directed as designated by the Stockholder Representative to the Stockholders after the Closing. The parties will cooperate to structure any assignment of the Earn Out shall be done in a manner that minimizes tax to Parent, the Company Group and the Company Equityholders following the Closing.

 (b) _ By Parent._ Following the Closing, Parent shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the Stockholders and their subsidiaries and each of their respective representatives (collectively, the " _Stockholder Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all Losses incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in _Article V_ (in each case, without giving effect to materiality qualifications with respect to the calculation of the amount of Losses incurred by a Stockholder Indemnitee); or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement. 

  

  

 7.3 _ Limitations on Indemnity._

aggregate liability of Parent with respect to claims for indemnification by
the Stockholder Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i_) and _(b)(ii)_

 (f) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall operate to limit the liability of any Company Equityholder to any Parent Indemnitee for common law fraud committed by the Company with respect to this Agreement as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , that no Stockholder be liable to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article VII_ for any Losses in excess, in the aggregate, of the total value of the consideration actually received by such Stockholder hereunder unless such Stockholder is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have committed common law fraud against Parent or Merger Sub. Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall operate to limit the liability of Parent to any Stockholder Indemnitee for common law fraud committed by Parent with respect to this Agreement as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Equityholders shall not be liable for any Taxes incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period. 

   

 (h) The foregoing is not intended to, and shall not, limit any recovery by Parent available under the RandW Insurance Policy. 

  

 (i) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.3_ shall not apply to claims for Parent\'s failure to consummate the transaction pursuant to _Article IX_. 

  

  

 7.4 _ Direct Claims Indemnification Procedures._ 

  

  

 (a) If a Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written demand (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") to Parent (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Parent Indemnitee), as applicable (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which Claim Certificate shall contain a description of, and if reasonably determinable at the time such demand is delivered, the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by such Indemnified Party and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor. The failure to provide such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnifying Party\'s obligations under this _Article VII_ except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days of the receipt thereof, object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate arising out of any claim or claims that are not objected to by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (c) In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed, and the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party the amount set forth in such memorandum in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event that the Parties are not able to reach an agreement, or the memorandum contains an agreement as to only a portion of the Losses in question, the parties may resolve such dispute in the manner provided in _Section 10.5_. 

  

  

 7.5 _ Defense of Third-Party Claims._ 

  

  

 (a) A party seeking indemnification hereunder in connection with a claim by any Person other than the Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") shall provide prompt notice of such Third-Party Claim to Parent (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a Parent Indemnitee), as applicable, which notice describes in reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim and includes copies of all material written correspondence received by such party in connection therewith; _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect an Indemnifying Party\'s obligations under this _Article VII_ except and only to the extent that an Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, subject to the consent rights of any insurer or any other limitations in the RandW Insurance Policy, in its discretion and at its expense, to participate in and control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party may control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim only if (i) the claim does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief; (ii) the claim does not involve criminal allegations, a Governmental Authority, or any material supplier, customer, or other partner to the business conducted by the Company Group; (iii) the Indemnifying Party admits that such Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article VII_ and that the Indemnifying Party will pay any Losses arising therefrom (subject to the limitations in this _Article VII_); (iv) such Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim and a reasonable description of such Third-Party Claim; (v) such Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim diligently; and (vi) in the case of a claim against a Parent Indemnitee, the assumption of the defense would not cause any Parent Indemnitee to lose coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party apprised of all developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, neither party shall not admit to any Liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim for which indemnity is sought without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the other party; _provided_ , that an Indemnified Party shall have no obligation of any kind to consent to the entrance of any judgment or into any settlement unless such judgment or settlement (i) is for only money damages, the full amount of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, and 

  

      

  

(ii) includes, as a condition thereof, an express, unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from any liability or obligation with respect to such
Third-Party Claim; _provided, further_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, such consent shall be subject, in all cases, to the terms
(including any right of the insurer to consent) of the RandW Insurance Policy.

  

 (c) If any condition in _Section 7.5(a)_ is or becomes unsatisfied, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) to the extent the indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically (but no less often than monthly) for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel engaged by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) to the extent the Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as result of, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Article VII_. This _Section 7.5_ shall not apply to Taxes which shall be governed by _Section 6.8(e)_. 

  

  

 7.6 _ Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition._ The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedies based on such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements. 

  

 7.7 _ Escrow; Payment._ 

  

  

 (a) If a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder pursuant to _Section 7.2(a_) (other than _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_), (i) first, such Parent Indemnitee shall recover any Losses from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, (ii) second, such Parent Indemnitee shall recover such Losses under the RandW Insurance Policy, if applicable, and (iii) third, solely with respect to claims under _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ or _(vii)_ or as set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_ and breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental Representations, such Parent Indemnitee shall recover any remaining Losses to which such Parent Indemnitee is entitled directly from the Stockholders severally in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_ and to the extent permitted pursuant to _Section 7.3_. 

  

 (b) If a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_, it may recover any Losses only from the Special Escrow Account and may not recover any remaining Losses directly from the Stockholders.

Within five (5) Business Day after the resolution of any claim for indemnification for which a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to recover Losses directly from a Stockholder, such Stockholder shall deliver to such Parent Indemnitee the amount for which it is directly responsible by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Parent.

 7.8 _ No Contribution._ No Stockholder shall have, and no Stockholder shall exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution or right of indemnity against the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with any indemnification obligation to a Parent Indemnitee to which such Stockholder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to claims under _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ or _(vii)_ or as set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_ and breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental Representations, the Stockholders shall have no liability in excess of the Cap regardless of whether Losses are recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy. 

  

 7.10 _ Tax Consequences of Payments._ Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this _Article VII_ will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file their respective Tax Returns accordingly and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law. 

   

 7.11 _ Losses Net of Insurance._ Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or other similar amounts actually recovered by Parent with respect to the Losses, net of any likely increase in premium, or cost of recovery.

 10.10 _ Amendments._ This Agreement may not be amended or modified except in an instrument in writing signed (if prior to the Closing) by the Company and Parent or (if after the Closing) by the Stockholder Representative and Parent. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. For the purposes of this _Section 10.10_, any amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment, modification or waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Sections 9.2_, _10.17_  and _10.19_ and _10.20_ and this _Section 10.10_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of _Sections 9.2_, _10.17_ and _10.19_ and this _Section 10.10_) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to any of the Financing Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. 

  

 10.11 _ Severability._ If any term, condition or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

       

                                    

  

 10.12 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, together with all exhibits, appendices and schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule), constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior negotiations, correspondence, agreements, understandings, duties or obligations between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 10.13 _ Construction._ Each party hereto agrees that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

   

 10.14 _ No Personal Liability._ This Agreement and all documents, understandings and arrangements relating hereto and/or to the transactions contemplated hereby have been negotiated, executed and delivered on behalf of the parties hereto by their respective officers, directors, employees, members, partners, attorneys and/or agents in their representative capacities and not individually, and, except as set forth in this Agreement, no officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner, attorney, agent or shareholder of any party hereto shall be bound or held to any personal liability or responsibility in connection with the agreements, obligations and undertakings by the parties hereunder and/or under any documents, understandings and arrangements relating hereto and/or to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 10.15 _ Fees, Costs and Expenses._ Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall bear all of its own fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel or other representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses) incurred by such party hereto in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 

   

 10.16 _ Waivers._ No purported waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding upon any of the parties to this Agreement unless: (a) with respect to waivers by the Company on or prior to the Closing, the Company has duly executed and delivered to Parent a written instrument which states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this Agreement; (b) with respect to waivers by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative has duly executed and delivered to the Parent a written instrument which states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this Agreement; (c) with respect to waivers by the Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing, Parent has duly executed and delivered to the Company a written instrument which states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this Agreement; or (d) with respect to waivers by Parent or Merger Sub after to the Closing, Parent has duly executed and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written instrument which states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this Agreement. Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time and at any time) by a party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for any period of time) to exercise, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a waiver of the right to exercise, impair, limit or restrict the exercise of, such right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of such party or shall, except to the extent so waived, impair, limit or restrict the exercise of such right, power or remedy. 

  

 10.17 _ No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement and all of its conditions and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) any Person that is not a party to this 

        

Agreement but, by the terms of _Article VII_, is entitled to indemnification
and (b) with respect to _Sections 9.2_, _10.10_ , _10.19_ and _10.20_ and
this _Section 10.17_, the Financing Source Related Parties, shall be
considered a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, with full rights of
enforcement as though such Person was a signatory to this Agreement.

  

 10.18 _ Appointment of the Stockholder Representative._ 

  

  

 (a) By executing this Agreement, the Company (and, upon execution of a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Company Equityholders) shall be deemed to have constituted and appointed, effective from and after the date of this Agreement, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each Stockholder to act as the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall take any and all actions required, permitted, necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Company Equityholders as if the Company Equityholders were acting on their own behalf, including: 

    

 (i) taking any and all actions (including, without limitation, executing and delivering any documents and incurring any costs and expenses on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and making any and all determinations which may be required or permitted in connection with the post-Closing implementation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; 

  

 (ii) giving and receiving notices and communications under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; 

  

 (iii) negotiating, defending, settling, compromising and otherwise handling and resolving any and all claims and disputes with Parent and any other Parent Indemnitees arising out of or in respect of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, claims and disputes pursuant to this _Article VII_; 

   

 (iv) retaining legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts in connection with all matters and things set forth or necessary with respect to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and 

  

 (v) making any other decision or election or exercising such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the foregoing. 

    

 (c) Upon execution of a Stockholder Transmittal Letter, each Company Equityholder acknowledges and agrees (i) that upon any delivery by the Stockholder Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other document executed by the Stockholder Representative, such Company Equityholder shall be bound by such documents as fully as if such Company Equityholder had executed and delivered such documents, (ii) that process may be served on such Company Equityholder in the care of the Stockholder Representative in accordance with _Section 10.5_ and (iii) to be bound by the provisions set forth in _Sections 10.4_, _10.5_ , and _10.6_ as if they were a party to this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Upon the resignation, death, disability or incapacity of the initial Stockholder Representative, then such Person as is appointed by the Company Equityholders who held a majority of the voting power of the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall become the Stockholder Representative; _provided_ that no change in the Stockholder Representative shall be effective prior to the delivery to Parent of written notice thereof from such Company Equityholders. The Stockholder Representative shall not receive compensation for service in such capacity. 

  

      

  

 (e) Any and all actions taken or not taken, exercises of rights, power or authority and any decision or determination made by the Stockholder Representative in connection herewith shall be absolutely and irrevocably binding upon the Company Equityholders as if such Company Equityholder had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or authority or made such decision or determination in its individual capacity, and Parent may rely upon such action, exercise of right, power, or authority or such decision or determination of the Stockholder Representative as the action, exercise, right, power, or authority, or decision or determination of such Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by the Stockholder Representative and any acts done by Parent in accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 (f) The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the Stockholder Representative\'s services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representative\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Company Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representative\'s execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Equityholders; provided, that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Stockholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the Company Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this Section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire $250,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ ") to the Stockholder Representative, which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative will 

  

      

  

hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Stockholder
Representative\'s responsibilities, the Stockholder Representative will
deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Payments
Administrator for further distribution to the Company Equityholders. For tax
purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Shareholders at the time of Closing.

  

  

 10.19 _ Lender Limitations._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but without limiting the following sentence), each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that it will not bring or support any person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal or New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii) agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules on conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, advisors, representatives, members and stockholders shall not have any rights and agree not to bring any claims or directly seek specific performance (other than, following the Closing, rights and claims pursuant to any definitive financing documents entered into with the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing) against any Financing Source Related Party, in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) no Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, advisors, representatives and stockholders (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing, liabilities to the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to any definitive financing documents entered into with the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing) for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. 

  

 10.20 _ Specific Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that 

        

the parties hereto do not perform any provision of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.
