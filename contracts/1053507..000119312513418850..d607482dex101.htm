7 2.7. _Adjustment of the Securities Purchase Price and Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Section 2.7(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a report
containing the SellersÂ’ RepresentativeÂ’s estimated calculation of TCF Run
Rate as of the date hereof for each Tower Site (" _Sellers Â’ Initial TCF
Report_"). At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
SellersÂ’ Representative shall deliver to Buyer a good faith calculation of
(i) the estimated amount of Closing Indebtedness, as of 11:59 p.m. New York
City time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the estimated amount of Closing Working
Capital, as of 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), and the
resulting Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, as of 11:59 p.m. New York
City time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (iii) the
estimated Tower Cash Flow as determined on 11:59 p.m. New York City time on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing TCF
Amount_ ") and the resulting Estimated Closing TCF Adjustment and (iv) the
estimated amount of Closing Cash as of 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), in
each case based on the CompanyÂ’s books and records and other information
available at the time, together with the determination of the Base Purchase
Price, the Base Merger Consideration, the Base Securities Purchase Price, the
MIPC Base Securities Purchase Price and the PGGM Blocker Base Securities
Purchase Price in a statement in the form of Exhibit D, all of which estimates
and determinations shall be prepared in each case in accordance with this
Agreement and otherwise as reflected in the example calculation used to
prepare Appendix E and the CompanyÂ’s historic audited financial statements,
except as to straightlining. In the event Buyer notifies SellersÂ’
Representative of any objection to the Closing Statement prior to the
Closing, then Buyer and the SellersÂ’ Representative shall discuss in good
faith any such objections prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that if
Buyer and the SellersÂ’ Representative are unable to resolve any such
objections prior to the Closing Date, then the Estimated Closing Indebtedness,
Estimated Closing Working Capital and Estimated Closing TCF Amount as
determined by the SellersÂ’ Representative shall be used for the purpose of
calculating the Base Purchase Price as of the Closing, and such objections
shall be resolved post-Closing as set forth in Section 2.7(b).

 

(b) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
the SellersÂ’ Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") that
shall include the CompanyÂ’s calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash, and Closing Working Capital and the Closing Statement TCF Amount, in
each case in accordance with this Agreement and otherwise as reflected in the
example calculation used to prepare Appendix E and the CompanyÂ’s historic
audited financial statements, except as to straightlining. During the period
from the Closing to the delivery of the Closing Statement, Buyer and its
representatives shall be permitted to review the SellersÂ’ working papers and
the working papers of the SellersÂ’ independent accountants, if any, and shall
have access to the SellersÂ’ and their SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel and relevant

 



8  representatives in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement
and the calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and
Closing Statement TCF Amount, as well as the relevant books and records of
the SellersÂ’ and their Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants of the Sellers shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to Buyer unless and until Buyer shall have signed
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreements relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants. During the fifteen (15) days immediately
following the SellersÂ’ RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Closing Statement (the
" _Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period_ "), the Sellers Representative and
its representatives shall be permitted to review the CompanyÂ’s working papers
and the working papers of the CompanyÂ’s independent accountants, if any,
relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and
Closing Statement TCF Amount therein, as well as the relevant books and
records of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent
accountants of the Company shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the SellersÂ’ Representative unless and until the SellersÂ’
Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. The SellersÂ’
Representative shall notify Buyer in writing (the " _Notice of Purchase Price
Adjustment Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Review Period if the SellersÂ’ Representative disagrees with the
Closing Statement or the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Working
Capital or Closing Statement TCF Amount set forth therein. The Notice of
Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the SellersÂ’
RepresentativeÂ’s determination of the amount of the Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and Closing Statement TCF
Amount, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. If no
Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement is received by Buyer on or
prior to the expiration date of the Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period,
then the Closing Statement and the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash,
Closing Working Capital and Closing Statement TCF Amount set forth in the
Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the SellersÂ’
Representative and shall become final and binding upon the Parties. During
the thirty (30) days immediately following the timely delivery of a Notice of
Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement, the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer
shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment
Disagreement. If the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer cannot agree on the
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and Closing
Statement TCF Amount within such thirty (30)-day period, the Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Statement
TCF Amount, in each case solely to the extent not agreed between Buyer and the
SellersÂ’ Representative, shall be determined by Ernst and Young or other
independent auditors acceptable to SellerÂ’s Representative and Buyer (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "). The SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer shall
furnish the Independent Accountant with a statement setting forth the items
from the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement that are still in
dispute (the " _Independent Accountant Dispute Notice_ "). In the event
that Ernst and Young or other independent auditors acceptable to SellerÂ’s
Representative and Buyer refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the
Independent Accountant, the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer shall cooperate
in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in
the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable

 



9  to the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer, in which event " _Independent
Accountant_ " shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the
submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on all of the
Parties, of the amount of each of the line items in the Closing Statement as
to which there is disagreement as specified in the Independent Accountant
Dispute Notice. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination,
if not in accordance with the position of either the SellersÂ’ Representative
or Buyer, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by the SellersÂ’ Representative in the Notice of Purchase
Price Adjustment Disagreement or Buyer in the Closing Statement with respect
to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters in the Independent
Accountant Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The statement of the Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and Closing Statement TCF
Amount and the determination of the Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash,
Closing Working Capital and Closing Statement TCF Amount therefrom that are
final and binding on the Parties, as determined either through agreement of
the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer (deemed or otherwise) or through the
determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.7(b)
is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Cash_
", " _Final Working Capital_ ", and " _Final TCF Amount_ " respectively.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, the Parties shall each make
available to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such information,
books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the
Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.7(b);
provided, however, that the independent accountants of the Company shall not
be obligated to make any working papers available to the
Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed
a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The costs of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the Party
(i.e., Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers (pro rata among them based on
their proportionate direct and indirect ownership of MIPT as set forth on
Appendix B), on the other hand) whose calculation of the Closing
Indebtedness, Working Capital and Closing Statement TCF Amount, taken as a
whole and as set forth in the Independent Accountant Dispute Notice, is
farther away from the final determination by the Independent Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.7(b).

(c) No later than two (2) Business Days after each of the Final Closing
Indebtedness, the Final Working Capital and the Final TCF Amount have been
agreed upon or determined in accordance with this Section 2.7, Buyer shall
deliver to the SellersÂ’ Representative the determination of the Final Purchase
Price (the " _Final Purchase Price Statement_ ") (by recalculating the Base
Purchase Price using the Final Closing Indebtedness in lieu of Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, the Final Cash in lieu of the Estimated Cash, the Final
Working Capital in lieu of the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Final
Working Capital Adjustment in lieu of the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment, and the Final TCF Amount and Final TCF Adjustment in lieu of the
Estimated Closing TCF Amount and the Estimated Closing TCF Adjustment),
together with the calculations required pursuant to Section 2.7(d) or 2.7(e),
as the case may be, which determination and calculations shall be final and
binding on the Parties (absent manifest calculation error).

 



10 (d) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Base Purchase Price (such
amount, the " _Excess Amount_ ") the Escrow Agent shall pay promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days after delivery by Buyer of the Final
Purchase Price Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(c)), from the Escrow
Amount, the Excess Amount to Buyer (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. dollar-denominated funds, to such account or
accounts designated by Buyer to the Escrow Agent in writing not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the date that the payment of such amount is due.
To the extent the Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay the Excess Amount in
its entirety, any remainder still owed to Buyer after the Escrow Amount has
been disbursed to Buyer shall be paid to Buyer by the Management Holders and
the Sellers as follows:

(i) each Management Holder that held Series B Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer an amount equal to (x)
the Per Unit Series B Merger Consideration (calculated based on the Base
Merger Consideration but using a Base Purchase Price that is reduced by
the Escrow Amount) minus the Per Unit Series B Merger Consideration
(calculated based on the Final Merger Consideration) multiplied by (y) the
number of Series B Units held by such Management Holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Series B Excess Amount_ ");

(ii) each Management Holder that held Series C Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer an amount equal to (x)
the Per Unit Series C Merger Consideration (calculated based on the Base
Merger Consideration but using a Base Purchase Price that is reduced by the
Escrow Amount) minus the Per Unit Series C Merger Consideration (calculated
based on the Final Merger Consideration) multiplied by (y) the number of
Series C Units held by such Management Holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Series C Excess Amount_ "); and

(iii) each Management Holder that held Series A Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time who was entitled to receive a portion of the Series A
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) and each Seller shall pay
or cause to be paid to Buyer an amount equal to (x) (I) the Excess
Amount minus (II) the sum of the Series B Excess Amount and the Series C
Excess Amount, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of consideration received by such Person pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or
2.6, as applicable, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
consideration received by all Management Holders that held Series A Units and
all Sellers pursuant to Sections 2.2(b) and 2.6;

 

All amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) shall be paid promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days after delivery by Buyer of
the Final Purchase Price Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(c)) to Buyer (or
its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollar-
denominated funds, to such account or accounts designated by Buyer in
writing not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date that the
payment of such amount is due. The obligations under this Section 2.7(d) shall
be several, but not joint, obligations of each Seller and each Management
Holder. A sample calculation of the payments required in respect of any
Excess Amount pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) is provided for illustrative
purposes in Appendix E.

 



11 (e) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Base Purchase Price (such
amount, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "), Buyer shall pay promptly (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days after delivery by Buyer of the Final
Purchase Price Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(c)), the Deficiency Amount to
the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollar
denominated funds for distribution as follows:

(i) to each Management Holder that held Series B Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time, an amount equal to (x) the Per Unit Series B Merger
Consideration (calculated based on the Final Merger Consideration) minus the
Per Unit Series B Merger Consideration (calculated based on the Base Merger
Consideration) multiplied by (y) the number of Series B Units held by such
Management Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Series B
Deficiency Amount_ "); 

(ii) to each Management Holder that held Series C Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time, an amount equal to (x) the Per Unit Series C Merger
Consideration (calculated based on the Final Merger Consideration) minus the
Per Unit Series C Merger Consideration (calculated based on the Base Merger
Consideration) multiplied by (y) the number of Series C Units held by such
Management Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Series C
Deficiency Amount_ "); and

 

(iii) to each Management Holder that held Series A Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time who was entitled to receive a portion of the Series A
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) and to each Seller, an
amount equal to (x) (I) the Deficiency Amount minus (II) the sum of all Series
B Purchase Price Adjustments and Series C Purchase Price Adjustments,
multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
consideration received by such Person pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or 2.6, as
applicable, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of consideration received by all Management Holders that held Series A Units
and all Sellers pursuant to Sections 2.2(b) and 2.6.

(f) This Section 2.7 shall survive the Closing.

2.8. _Rounding_. If the calculation of any amount payable to any of the
Sellers or the Management Holders under Article II results in a fraction of a
cent, the SellersÂ’ Representative may round such amount (up or down) as it
sees fit.

 

2.9. _Withholding_. Each of Buyer, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the applicable
Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
hereof as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. 

2.10. _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, an amount equal to $240 million shall be
deposited by Buyer with the Escrow Agent (such amount, the " _Escrow Amount_
"). The Escrow Amount shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent on the
terms and subject to the conditions

 



12  contained in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement. The amount of $40
million shall be released to the Paying Agent by the Escrow Agent on the 180th
day following the Closing Date, and any remaining balance of the Escrow
Amount shall be released on the 365th day following the Closing Date, with
such initial $40 million release reduced by any portion of the Escrow Amount
previously distributed to Buyer from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms
hereof, the amount of any pending claim for purchase price adjustment under
Section 2.7(b) or Section 2.7(d), and the amount of any pending claims that
have been noticed to the SellersÂ’ Representative pursuant to Section 9.5, and
such final release to be reduced by the amount of any pending claims that have
been noticed to the SellersÂ’ Representative pursuant to Section 9.5. The
Paying Agent shall distribute such amounts (and any amounts subsequently
released to Paying Agent on behalf of the Sellers and the Management Holders
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) to the Sellers and Management Holders as
though a Deficiency Amount exists pursuant to Section 2.7(e), with
calculations involving the Base Merger Consideration computed using a Base
Purchase Price that is reduced by the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount.

nor the consummation of the Securities Purchase by such Seller nor the
consummation of the Merger by Macquarie GTPI will result in the creation of
any Lien, upon any of the assets of such Seller, any of the Holding Companies
or Macquarie GTPI, or conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any
term, condition or provision of or termination of, or otherwise give any other
Person the right to terminate, or constitute a default, event of default or

(i) any Organizational Document of such Seller, any of the Holding Companies
or Macquarie GTPI, as the case may be;

 



15 (ii) any Law applicable to such Seller, any of the Holding Companies or
Macquarie GTPI; or

(iii) any Contract or governmental authorization to which such Seller, any of
the Holding Companies or Macquarie GTPI is a party or by which any of its
properties or businesses is bound;

except, with respect to (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches,

of the Sellers, threatened against such Seller, any of the Holding Companies

any of the Holding Companies or Macquarie GTPI or any of their respective
assets are bound or subject (in each case except for orders, rulings,

individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.7. _Broker or Finder_. Except for Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., which is
entitled to certain advisory fees in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (for whose compensation the
Sellers and the Management Holders are solely responsible), no agent, broker,

is entitled to any brokerage, finderÂ’s or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon any
arrangements made by or on behalf of any Seller, Holding Company, Management
Holder or the Company. 

3.8. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) MIPT (including, for purposes of this Section 3.8(a), TPP for periods
prior to its merger with MIPT) (i) for all taxable years commencing with such
REIT EntityÂ’s taxable year ending December 31, 2007 through the taxable year
ending December 31, 2012 has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has
complied with all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii)
since the end of its most recent taxable year has in fact been organized and
has operated in accordance with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code and has not taken or omitted to take any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of its
qualification or taxation as a REIT and (iii) intends to continue to operate,
in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT
for the portion of the taxable year ending as of the Closing (assuming for
all purposes that the taxable year ended as of the Closing). No challenge to
MIPTÂ’s status as a REIT is pending or has been threatened in writing.

 



16 (b) None of MIPT nor any Subsidiary of MIPT holds any asset subject to
Sections 337(d) and 1374 of the Code (including through application of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-7), nor has any of them disposed of any
such asset during its 2013 taxable year.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, MIPT does not have any earnings and profits
attributable to MIPT or any other corporation accumulated in any non-REIT
year within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code. The aggregate positive
current and accumulated earnings and profits (as measured for federal income
Tax purposes) of each of MIPC and PGGM Blocker through the Closing will be
less than $5,000,000.

(d) Since the beginning of MIPTÂ’s taxable year ending December 31, 2007, MIPT
(including, for purposes of this Section 3.8(d), TPP for periods prior to its
merger with MIPT) has not incurred any liability for material Taxes under
Sections 856(c)(7), 857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which has not
been previously paid. MIPT has not engaged at any time in any "prohibited
transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code or any
transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents", "redetermined
deductions" or "excess interest" as each is described in Section 857(b)(7) of
the Code.

(e) MIPT is a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity" within
the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code and a "domestically controlled
REIT" within the meaning of Section 1.897-1(c)(2)(i) of the Treasury
Regulations.

 

(f) Based on MIPTÂ’s income and activities from January 1, 2013 through
immediately before the Effective Time (and assuming for this purpose that
MIPT had no further income or activities immediately following the Effective
Time), MIPT will not be a "personal holding company" within the meaning of
Section 542(a) of the Code for its 2013 taxable year. Immediately before the
Effective Time, the aggregate basis of the assets of MIPT will exceed the sum
of (i) the amount of the liabilities of MIPT at such time plus (ii) the net
income of MIPT (including MIPTÂ’s share of income from the Company) from
January 1, 2013 through immediately before the Effective Time, by not less
than $200,000,000, all as determined for federal income Tax purposes;
_provided_ , that in determining whether there has been a breach of the
foregoing representation and warranty for purposes of indemnification under
Article 9, the reference to $200,000,000 shall be replaced with $0. All
distributions by MIPT and by TPP (for periods prior to its merger with MIPT)
to the holders of any class of its units with respect to such units have been
properly and timely made on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the terms of
MIPTÂ’s or TPPÂ’s Organizational Documents, as applicable and as in effect at
the time of the distribution. No distribution with respect to any unit of or
interest in MIPT or TPP constituted a "preferential dividend", as that term is
defined in Section 562(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
and no such distribution would have constituted such a preferential dividend
if there were sufficient earnings and profits of MIPT or TPP, as applicable,
under Section 316 of the Code such that all distributions by MIPT or TPP, as
applicable, during the year of the distribution would have been taxable
dividends under Section 301(c)(1) of the Code.

(g) PGGM BlockerÂ’s basis in its MIPT Interests is no less than $120,000,000.
MIPCÂ’s basis in its MIPT Interests is no less than $50,000,000.

 



17 (h) Each of the Holding Companies has timely filed all material Tax Returns
required to be filed (after giving effect to any valid extensions of time in
which to make such filings) and all material Taxes due and payable by any of
them have been paid or remitted and, where payment is not yet due, adequate
provision has been made for such Taxes in accordance with GAAP. No portion of
any Tax Return of any Holding Company is currently the subject of any audit or
Legal Action by any Taxing Authority. There are no material Tax Liens (other
than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of the
Holding Companies that will not be paid prior to Closing, except for Permitted
Liens. None of the Holding Companies has entered into any Tax allocation,
sharing or indemnification agreement with any Person. Since its
formation, each of PGGM Blocker and MIPC has been treated as a corporation
for purposes of federal income Tax Laws.

(i) No Holding Company has ever been a member of any affiliated group of
corporations (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code or under any
comparable provision of state, local or foreign Law) or filed or been included
in a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return. No Holding Company is
presently liable, or has any potential liability, for any Taxes of another
Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or comparable provision of
state, local or foreign Law).

 

3.9. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 3 or Article 4,
Buyer acknowledges that neither any Seller nor any other Person on behalf of
any Seller makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to any Seller, any Holding Company or Macquarie GTPI or with
respect to any other information provided to Buyer. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 3 or Article 4, no
Seller nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Buyer or BuyerÂ’s use of, any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Buyer in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is
understood that any cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any
data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering materials
or presentations provided or addressed to Buyer are not and shall not be
deemed to be or to include representations and warranties of the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates.

Agreement or the Closing or by the waiver of any condition to Closing.

respect to the last sentence thereof), 4.10, 4.13 and 4.20;

 

(ii) any inaccuracy in or any breach of, as of the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, any representation and warranty set forth in Sections
3.5(ii), 3.5(iii), 3.6, 4.4(ii), 4.4(iii), 4.4(iv), 4.5, 4.6, 4.9 (but only
with respect to the last sentence thereof), 4.10, 4.13 and 4.20; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this clause (ii) if any such representation
or warranty is qualified in any respect by materiality or Material Adverse
Effect, for purposes of this clause (ii) such materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualification will in all respects be ignored;

 

(iii) any failure by the Sellers or the Company and its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) to duly and timely perform or fulfill any of its covenants or
agreements required to be performed by the Sellers or the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as applicable) under this Agreement or any document or other
paper delivered by the Sellers or the Company and its Subsidiaries
(as applicable) pursuant to this Agreement; or

(iv) to the extent not previously paid, all out-of-pocket third party costs
or expenses incurred by Sellers or incurred prior to Closing by the Company
or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Seller Transaction Expenses.

 

(b) The Management Holders shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses that may be asserted
against, or paid, suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party (whether

or any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Sections 4.4(ii),
4.4(iii), 4.4(iv), 4.5, 4.6, 4.9 (but only with respect to the last sentence
thereof), 4.10, 4.13 and 4.20;

 



48 (ii) any inaccuracy in or any breach of, as of the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, any representation and warranty set forth in Sections

(iv) to the extent not previously paid, all out-of-pocket third party costs
or expenses incurred by Sellers or incurred prior to Closing by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Seller Transaction Expenses.

(c) Any liability of the Sellers or Management Holders under this Article 9
shall be solely on a several, and not joint, basis in the same proportion
that each such PersonÂ’s portion of the Final Purchase Price bears to the
entire amount of the Final Purchase Price paid or payable by all such Persons
who are responsible to provide such indemnity pursuant to this Article 9;
provided that with respect to (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation of warranty of any particular Seller under Article 3, or (ii)
any failure by a particular Seller to duly and timely perform or fulfill its
covenants (excluding covenants to be fulfilled by the Sellers as a group), in
each case only such breaching Sellers shall be liable under this Article 9 in
proportion (as between each other) to the relative amount of the Final
Purchase Price paid or payable to such Sellers; and provided further that, a
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be able to recover up to the full amount of
funds in the Escrow Account remaining at any given time with respect to the
several liability of any such Person.

Indemnified Party (whether or not due to third party claims) that arise out of
or result from (a) the inaccuracy, as of the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such representation or
warranty is qualified in any respect by materiality, for purposes of this
paragraph such materiality qualification will in all respects be ignored and
(b) any failure by Buyer to perform or fulfill any of its covenants or
agreements required to be performed by Buyer under this Agreement. __

 



49 9.4. _Limitations; Calculation of Losses_.

 

 __(a) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any claim
arising under clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of Section 9.2
relating to a breach or alleged breach of a representation or warranty unless
and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered, incurred, sustained or
become subject to indemnifiable Losses referred to in those clauses in excess
of $72 million in the aggregate (and indemnity will be available only for such
excess). The maximum liability of the Sellers under Section 9.2 (other than
clauses (a)(iv) and (b)(iv)) shall not exceed $240 million in the aggregate
(the " _Indemnity Cap_ "). Other than in respect of a breach of the
Fundamental Representations, the Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in
the Escrow Account shall be the sole source of recovery with respect to any
Claims by or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on liability
contained in this Section 9.4(a) shall not apply to any claim for indemnity
based on any of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties, but in all
events the aggregate liability of all Sellers and Management Holders shall in
no event exceed the sum of the Final Securities Purchase Price and the Final
Merger Consideration. __

 

(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR SELLER/MANAGEMENT
INDEMNIFIED PARTY BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER FOR ANY EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, DIMINUTION IN VALUE,
REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF FUTURE PROFITS, REVENUE
OR INCOME OR LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR OPPORTUNITY (other than
indemnification for amounts actually paid to third parties in respect of any
third-party claim for which indemnification hereunder is otherwise required
and other than any post-Closing purchase price adjustments set forth in
Section 2.7 as they relate to Tower Cash Flow); _provided_ , _however_ , that
subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, the parties hereto agree
that, for purposes of determining "Losses" subject to indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) arising or resulting from any breach of
any representation or warranty that has a negative recurring impact on Tower
Cash Flow (or similar measure), Buyer shall be entitled to obtain damages
hereunder on the basis of an appropriate multiple (of up to the Valuation
Multiplier) of any item that reduced Tower Cash Flow (or similar measure).

(c) Except in the case of fraud, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
following the Closing, the exclusive remedy at law or in equity for any
Seller/Management Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party for Losses or
other monetary damages arising from a breach by the other Parties of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement and the exclusive remedy at
law for any Seller/Management Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party for
Losses or other monetary damages arising from the failure by the other
Parties to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this
Agreement, in each case, shall be the indemnification provided under this
Article 9 and (ii) anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall
give rise to any right on the part of any Party, after the consummation of the
purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its
Losses (including by using such efforts to recover any insurance as may be
available with respect to such Loss) upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to impose any
obligation or duty to initiate legal proceedings to seek such recovery.

 



50 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified
Party or Seller/Management Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for an
amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliates has been indemnified or
reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement to
which it is a party.

9.5. _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under this Article 9 shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

__(a) If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this
Article 9, it shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such
claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail to the extent known, the
basis on which indemnification is sought and the amount or estimated amount
(if known or estimable) of such Losses and the method of computation thereof,
and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises, and in the case
of a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), contain (by attachment or otherwise) all such other material
information as such Indemnified Party shall have received concerning such
Third Party Claim. The failure to provide (or timely provide) such notice
will not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent (i) the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced thereby or (ii) such Indemnifying Party actually
incurs a material incremental expense as a result of such failure, but in
each case only to the extent of such actual prejudice or incremental expense.
__

 

(b) In the case of a Third Party Claim against the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party may, within 15 days after receipt of such notice and upon
notice to the Indemnified Party, assume and control, with counsel of its
choice, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the settlement
or defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes and controls the defense
of such Third Party Claim: (A) the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense through separate co-counsel chosen by it at its sole cost and expense,
but the Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement, (B) the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (C) the
Indemnifying Party may not, without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise
any action or consent to the entry of any judgment, unless the judgment or
settlement provides solely for the payment of money and provides a full
release to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate and
assist the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
PartyÂ’s possession or under the Indemnified PartyÂ’s control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the interests of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party
Claim are in conflict with one another and, as a result, the Indemnifying
Party could not adequately in good faith represent the interests of the
applicable Indemnified Party in such claim, then the Indemnifying Party may
not be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



51 (c) If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim pursuant to the foregoing provisions (including if it does
not notify the Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense of such
claim within the 15 day period set forth above or fails to diligently pursue
such defense), then the Indemnified Party may conduct and control, through
counsel of its own choosing, the settlement or defense thereof, and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. If the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim and proposes
to settle such claim prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal
with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in the settlement or participate, assume or re-
assume the control of the defense of such Third Party Claim or proceeding (at
the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s own expense). The Indemnified Party shall not pay or
settle any Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written
consent; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s consent shall not waive
any dispute as to whether the Losses are indemnifiable pursuant to this
_Article 9_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnified Party may, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence
of Section 9.5(b), file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any
other action that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be necessary
or appropriate to protect its interests (but may not pay or settle any such
claim), and (ii) the Indemnified Party may take over the control of the
defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim at any time if it irrevocably
waives its right to indemnity under this Article 9 with respect to such
claim.

9.6. _Character of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payments made with respect to this Agreement shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by Law (including by a determination of a Tax authority
that, under applicable Law, is not subject to further review or appeal).

ARTICLE 10

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

10.1. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy
at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the
Sellers and Buyer shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

10.2. _Waivers; Amendments_. Amendments to this Agreement may be made only
with the consent in writing of the Sellers and Buyer. No delay on the part of
Sellers or Buyer at any time or times in the exercise of any right or remedy
shall operate as a waiver thereof. The failure to insist upon the
strict compliance with the provisions of any covenant, term, condition or
other provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy
thereunder shall not constitute a

 



52  waiver of any such covenant, term, condition or other provisions thereof or
default in connection therewith. The waiver of any covenant, term, condition
or other provision thereof or default thereunder shall not affect or alter
this Agreement in any other respect, and each and every covenant, term,
condition or other provision of this Agreement shall, in such event, continue
in full force and effect, except as so waived, and shall be operative with
respect to any other then existing or subsequent default in connection
therewith. Except as provided in Section 10.14, no waiver by one Party shall
be imputed or otherwise applicable to any other Party unless expressly set
forth in writing.

10.3. _Fees, Expenses and Other Payments_. Except as expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs.

 

10.4. _Notices_. All notices and other communications which by any provision
of this Agreement are required or permitted to be given shall be given in
writing and shall be deemed to have been delivered (a) five (5) Business Days
after being mailed by first-class or express mail, postage prepaid, (b) the
next day when sent overnight by recognized courier service, (c) upon
confirmation when sent by e-mail if sent before 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on a
Business Day of the recipient, confirmed by mailing (by first class or express
mail, postage prepaid, or by recognized courier service) written
confirmation on the same day as such e-mail is sent, or (d) upon delivery
when personally delivered to the receiving Party (which if other than an
individual shall be an officer or other responsible Party of the receiving
Party). All such notices and communications shall be mailed, sent or
delivered as set forth below or to such other Person(s), e-mail(s) or
address(es) as the Party to receive any such communication or notice may have
designated by written notice to the other Party.

10.5. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

10.6. _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company has delivered to Buyer a Disclosure
Schedule which includes numbered schedules corresponding to certain sections
or subsections of this Agreement or as otherwise specifically referred to in
Articles 3, 4 and 6. The representations and warranties of the Sellers and the
Company in this Agreement are made and given subject to the exceptions
thereto set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, which identifies exceptions only
by the specific Section or subsection to which such entry relates. The
inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedule or delivery of a document
pursuant to the Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement is not an admission of
liability or materiality with respect to such item or document or an admission
that an item or agreement listed therein was not entered into in, or otherwise
occurred outside of, the Ordinary Course of Business. Any matter disclosed in
any section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated into any other section or subsection of this
Disclosure Schedule to which its reference is readily apparent on its face.
Any reference in the Disclosure Schedule to a contract, agreement, instrument,

 



56  document, order, decree or judgment shall be deemed to include a reference
to all amendments and modifications thereof, if any, so long as such
amendments and modifications are or have been made available to Buyer as part
of its due diligence investigation.

10.7. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument, binding upon all of the Parties. To
the extent permitted by Law, in pleading or proving any provision of this
Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce more than one set of such
counterparts.

10.8. _Section Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New
York applicable to agreements made and to be performed solely therein (without
giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law or choice of law thereof
that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of
any other jurisdiction). In connection with any controversy arising out of or
related to this Agreement, each Party hereby irrevocably consents and submits
to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and, otherwise, in the state courts of the State of New
York located in New York County, and agrees all such controversies shall be
resolved solely in these jurisdictions. In connection with any controversy
arising out of or relating to the Agreement, each Party irrevocably (a)
consents to service of process out of the aforementioned courts, (b) WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS, (c)
agrees that service of process in any such Legal Action may, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, be effected by mailing a copy of such
process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of
mail), postage prepaid, to such Party at its address as provided in Section
10.4, and (d) agrees that nothing in the Agreement shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the applicable Laws
of the State of New York, as applicable.

 

10.10. _Further Acts_. Each Party agrees that at any time, and from time to
time, before and after the consummation of the Securities Purchase and the
Merger, it will do all such things and execute and deliver all other
assurances, as any other Party or its counsel reasonably deems necessary or
desirable in order to carry out the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or to facilitate the
enjoyment of any of the rights created hereby or to be created hereunder.

 

10.11. _Entire Agreement; Construction; No Implied Warranties_. This
Agreement (together with the Disclosure Schedule, the appendices and exhibits
hereto and the other documents delivered or to be delivered in connection
herewith) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and contemporaneous, arrangements, covenants, promises,
conditions, undertakings, inducements, representations, warranties and
negotiations, expressed or

 



57  implied, oral or written, between or among the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Each of the Parties is a sophisticated Person that was
advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other
advisors in connection with this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby
acknowledges that (a) none of the Parties has relied or will rely in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby upon any document
or written or oral information previously furnished to or discovered by it or
its representatives, other than this Agreement (or such of the foregoing as
are delivered at the Closing), (b) there are no representations, warranties
or covenants or agreements by or on behalf of any Party or any of its
respective Affiliates or representatives other than those expressly set forth
in this Agreement, and (c) the PartiesÂ’ respective rights and obligations
with respect to this Agreement and the events giving rise thereto will be
solely as set forth in this Agreement.

 

10.12. _Assignment_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
shall not be assignable (by operation of law or otherwise) by any Party,
without the prior consent of the SellersÂ’ Representative and Buyer, and absent
such consent any such assignment shall be null and void.

 

10.13. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person that is not a Party any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

10.14. _Sellers Â’ Representative_.

 

 __(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints Macquarie Infrastructure
Partners Inc. (" _MIP Inc._ ") as such SellerÂ’s representative, attorney-in-
fact and agent (as such, the " _Sellers Â’ Representative_"), with full power
of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Seller with
respect to the Securities Purchase and the Merger and to act on behalf of
such Seller in any amendment of or litigation or arbitration involving this
Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things,
and to execute all such documents, as such SellersÂ’ Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the power: __

 

(i) to take any action required or permitted to be taken by the SellersÂ’
Representative as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including to make
all determinations in respect of the Base Purchase Price and Final Purchase
Price and the portions thereof payable to the Sellers and the Management
Holders in accordance with Article 2;

 

(ii) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver
of any condition to the obligations of Sellers to consummate the Securities
Purchase and the Merger;

(iii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary
agreements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions,
waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to
be given in connection with the Securities Purchase and the Merger (it being
understood that such Sellers, shall execute and deliver any such documents
which the SellersÂ’ Representative agrees to execute);

 



58 (iv) to terminate this Agreement if Sellers are entitled to do so;

 

(v) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or received
under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection with the
any claims under this Agreement, including service of process in connection
with arbitration; and

 

(vi) to take all actions which under this Agreement that may be taken by
Sellers and to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of
Sellers which the SellersÂ’ Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully
and completely as such Sellers could do if personally present. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.14 shall be deemed
to alter the SellersÂ’ obligations with respect to the Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, regardless of any acts or omissions of the SellersÂ’
Representatives, including in the case of fraud, gross negligence or bad faith
on the part of the SellersÂ’ Representative.

 

(b) The SellersÂ’ Representative will not be liable for any act taken or
omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if such act is taken
as SellersÂ’ Representative or omitted in bad faith or gross negligence. The
SellersÂ’ Representative will also be fully protected in relying upon any
written notice, demand, certificate or document that it in good
faith believes to be genuine (including facsimiles thereof).

(c) The Sellers agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify (in accordance
with their respective direct and indirect ownership of MIPT as set forth on
Appendix B) the SellersÂ’ Representative for, and to hold the SellersÂ’
Representative harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the SellersÂ’
Representative, arising out of or in connection with the SellersÂ’
RepresentativeÂ’s carrying out its duties under this Agreement, including costs
and expenses of successfully defending the SellersÂ’ Representative against
any claim of liability with respect thereto. The SellersÂ’ Representative may
consult with counsel of its own choice and will have full and complete
authorization and protection for any action taken and suffered by it in good
faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The SellersÂ’
Representative is not receiving any fees, commissions or other compensation
for acting as the SellersÂ’ Representative.

 

(d) If MIP Inc. resigns in writing as SellersÂ’ Representative or otherwise
becomes unable to serve as SellersÂ’ Representative, MIP Inc. shall designate
as a successor SellersÂ’ Representative either (i) an Affiliate of MIP Inc. or
(ii) any other Person with the written consent of Purchaser (the " _Successor
Sellers Â’ Representative_");  _provided_ , that such resignation shall only
be effective upon effectiveness of a successor under this Section 10.14(d).
Upon written acceptance by such Successor SellersÂ’ Representative to serve as
SellersÂ’ Representative, such Successor SellersÂ’ Representative shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all of the powers and duties and
obligations of the original SellersÂ’ Representative without further act, and
the original SellersÂ’ Representative shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder

 



59  but shall continue to have the benefits of the indemnification set forth in
this Section 10.14. Notwithstanding any replacement of the original SellersÂ’
Representative hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10.14 shall continue
in effect for the benefit of the original SellersÂ’ Representative with respect
to all actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while acting as SellersÂ’
Representative.

 

(e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the SellersÂ’
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or
termination of this Agreement.

(f) The grant of authority to the SellersÂ’ Representative provided for in
this Section 10.14, (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller,
and (ii) shall survive the Closing.

 

10.15. _Several Obligations_. The obligations of each of the Sellers and the
Management Holders under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.

__10.16. _MSAM Entities_. Each of Macquarie Specialised Asset Management
Limited (" _MSAM_ ") and Macquarie Specialised Asset Management 2 Limited ("
_MSAM2_ " and, together with MSAM, the " _MSAM Entities_ ") has executed this
Agreement only in its capacity as the responsible entity of GIF IIIA and GIF
IIIB, respectively (for purposes of this Section 10.16, each a " _Trust_ ")
and in no other capacity. A liability arising under or in connection with
these terms of this Agreement is limited to and can be enforced against a
MSAM Entity only to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of property of
its respective Trust out of which such MSAM Entity is actually indemnified for
the liability. This limitation of the MSAM EntityÂ’s liability applies despite
any other provision of this Agreement and extends to all liabilities and
obligations of each MSAM Entity in any way connected with any representation,
warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this
Agreement. No Party may sue a MSAM Entity in any capacity other than as
responsible entity of its respective Trust. These provisions shall not apply
to any obligation or liability of a MSAM Entity to the extent that it is
not satisfied because under the constitution establishing the respective
Trust or by operation of Law there is a reduction in the extent of a MSAM
EntityÂ’s indemnification out of the assets of such Trust, as a result of the
fraud, negligence or breach of trust of such MSAM Entity. __

__10.17. _PGGM Purchaser_. Stichting Depositary PGGM Infrastructure Funds
has executed this Agreement, acting in its own name but in its capacity as
depositary of and for the account of PGGM Infrastructure Fund 2012. PGGM is
not a partnership ( _personenvennootschap_ ) nor a legal entity (
_rechtspersoon_ ) under Dutch law. Therefore, any claims against the PGGM
and/or the Depositary are against the Depositary as such, and not against the
participants in PGGM who, accordingly, are not liable for these claims.
Recourse for such claims shall be limited to the assets held by the
Depositary on behalf of PGGM. This limitation of PGGMÂ’s liability applies
despite any other provision of this Agreement and extends to all liabilities
and obligations of PGGM in any way connected with any representation,
warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this
Agreement. No Party may sue PGGM in any capacity other than as the Depositary.
__

 



60 10.18. _Buyer Guarantor_.

 

(a) Buyer Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Sellers and Management Holders, (i) BuyerÂ’s obligation to pay the Base
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price, and (ii) the payment of BuyerÂ’s
indemnification obligations (A) contained in Section 9.3 (Indemnification of
the Sellers) (which obligations under Section 9.3 are subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.1 (Survival of Representations, Warranties,
Covenants and Agreements) and 9.4 (Limitations; Calculation of Losses)) (the
"Buyer Guaranty"). Buyer Guarantor shall not have any obligation or
liability to any Person relating to, arising out of, or in connection with,
the Buyer Guaranty or this Agreement other than as expressly set forth in this
Section 10.18. Buyer Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, demand,
protest and notice as to the obligations guaranteed hereby and acceptance of
this Buyer Guaranty, the right to require Sellers to exhaust remedies against
any other Person and waives any other circumstance which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Buyer Guarantor as a
guarantor. Buyer Guarantor hereby waives all claims of waiver, release,
surrender, abstraction or compromise, counterclaims, cross-claims, recoupments
or other defenses that it may have against the Sellers. Buyer
Guarantor agrees to pay the costs and expenses in connection with the
enforcement of this Buyer Guaranty.

(b) The obligations of Buyer Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and
irrevocable and will not be discharged by: (i) any modification of, or
amendment or supplement to, this Agreement; (ii) any furnishing or acceptance
of security or any exchange or release of any security; (iii) any waiver,
consent or other action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any
right, remedy or power with respect to Buyer or any change in the structure of
Buyer; (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
composition, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceedings with respect to
Buyer; or (v) any other occurrence whatsoever, except performance in full of
all obligations of Buyer or Buyer Guarantor in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

(c) The Buyer Guaranty shall: (i) be binding upon Buyer Guarantor, its
successors and assigns; (ii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
the Sellers, the Management Holders and their respective successors and
assigns; and (iii) remain in full force and effect until the earlier of (A)
the payment in full of all obligations of Buyer under Section 9.3, and (B)
the performance in full of all obligations of Buyer Guarantor in accordance
with this Section 10.18.
