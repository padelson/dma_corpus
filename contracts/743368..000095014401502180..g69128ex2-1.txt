(v) reorganize, amalgamate or merge it or any of its  Subsidiaries with any
other person, corporation,  partnership or other business organization

taking such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the  condition
relating to the exercise or termination of stock  options referred to in

satisfactory relationships with suppliers,  agents, distributors, customers
and others having  business relationships with it or its Subsidiaries;  
(ii) not take any action, or permit any of its  Subsidiaries to take any
action, that would interfere  with or be inconsistent with the completion of
the  transaction contemplated hereunder or would render,  or that reasonably
may be expected to render, any  representation or warranty made by it in
this  Agreement untrue in any material respect at any time  prior to the
Effective Date if then made; and   (iii) promptly notify Bowater of any
material adverse  change, or any change which could reasonably be  expected
to become a material adverse change, in  respect of its or any of its

Subsidiaries\' properties, and of any  material Governmental Entity or third
party  complaints, investigations or hearings (or  communications indicating
that the same may be  contemplated);   (m) it shall not and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to settle or  compromise any Legal Proceeding or any matter
which could give  rise to a Legal Proceeding brought by any present, former
or  purported holder of any of its securities in connection with  the

in the usual, ordinary and regular course of business  and consistent with

enter into or modify in any  material respect any contract, agreement,
commitment or  arrangement which new contract or series of related new 
contracts or modification    19   Page 16   to an existing contract or
series of related existing  contracts would be material to Alliance or any of
its  Subsidiaries or which would have a material adverse effect on  Alliance
or any of its Subsidiaries;   (o) it shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy  (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions precedent
to its  obligations hereunder set forth in Article 6 to the extent the  same
is within its control and to take, or cause to be taken,  all other action
and to do, or cause to be done, all other  things necessary, proper or
advisable under all applicable  Laws to complete the Arrangement and the
transaction  contemplated by this Agreement, including using its 
commercially reasonable efforts to:   (i) obtain all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals  required to be obtained by it from other parties to 
loan agreements, leases and other contracts;   (ii) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals and  authorizations as are required to be obtained by
it  under any applicable Law;   (iii) effect all necessary registrations

order or other order or action seeking to stop, or  otherwise adversely
affecting the ability of the  Parties to consummate, the transaction
contemplated  hereby or the Arrangement;   (v) fulfill all conditions and
satisfy all provisions of  this Agreement and the Arrangement; and   (vi)
cooperate with Bowater in connection with the  performance by it of its
obligations hereunder;   (p) it shall not take any action, refrain from
taking any action  or (subject to its commercially reasonable efforts) permit
any  action to be taken or not taken, inconsistent with this  Agreement or
which would reasonably be expected to  significantly impede the consummation

such  action or refrain from taking such action as a result of this 
Agreement, Alliance shall immediately notify Bowater in  writing of such
circumstances;   (q) it shall, in all material respects, conduct itself so
as to  keep Bowater fully informed as to the material decisions or  actions
required or required to be made    20   Page 17   with respect to the
operation of its business and the  businesses of its Subsidiaries; provided
that such disclosure  is not otherwise prohibited by reason of a
confidentiality  obligation owed to a third party for which a waiver could
not  be obtained or is in respect of customer-specific  competitively
sensitive information relating to areas or  projects where Alliance and
Bowater are competitors;   (r) it shall make, or cooperate as necessary in
the making of, all  other necessary filings and applications under all
applicable  Laws required in connection with the transaction contemplated 
herein and take all reasonable action necessary to be in  compliance with
such Laws;   (s) it shall conduct its affairs and shall cause its
Subsidiaries  to conduct their affairs so that all of its representations 
and warranties contained herein shall be true and correct in  all material
respects on and as of the Effective Date as if  made on and as of such
date;   (t) it shall not allow the indebtedness of Alliance and its 
Subsidiaries for borrowed money (whether current or long term)  to exceed

facilitate an orderly merger on the Effective Date of  Alliance\'s business
with Bowater\'s business including, without  limitation, ensuring Bowater has
sufficient access to  information for its purpose in accordance with the
provisions  of Section 5.6 hereof.  5.3. COVENANTS OF BOWATER   Bowater
covenants and agrees that until the Effective Date or the day upon which this
Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier:   (a) it shall take all such
steps and do all such acts and things,  including without limitation, making
or causing to be made  cash payments and issuing Exchangeable Shares and
Bowater  Common Shares, as are specified in the Plan of Arrangement and  the
Final Order to be taken or done by Bowater or any  Subsidiary of Bowater;  
(b) it shall not split, combine or reclassify any of its  outstanding shares,
or declare, set aside or pay any dividend  or other distribution payable in
cash, stock, property or  otherwise with respect to its shares (other than
regular  quarterly dividends in respect of its common shares, in  amounts
consistent with past practice, and dividends provided  for pursuant to the
provisions of its preferred shares);   (c) it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy  (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions
precedent to its  obligations hereunder set forth in Article 6 to the extent
the  same is within its control and to take, or cause to be taken,  all
other action and to do, or cause to be done, all other  things necessary,
proper or advisable under all applicable  Laws to complete the Arrangement
and the    21   Page 18   transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
including using  its commercially reasonable efforts to:   (i) obtain all
necessary waivers, consents and approvals  required to be obtained by it from
other parties to  loan agreements, leases and other contracts;   (ii)
obtain all necessary consents, approvals and  authorizations as are required
to be obtained by it  under any applicable Law;   (iii) effect all

the Arrangement and the transaction contemplated  by this Agreement and
participate, and appear in any  proceedings of, either Party before
Governmental  Entities;   (iv) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining  order or other order or action seeking to stop, or  otherwise
adversely affecting the ability of the  parties to consummate, the
transaction contemplated  hereby or the Arrangement;   (v) fulfill all
conditions precedent to Alliance\'s  obligations hereunder and satisfy all
provisions of  this Agreement and the Arrangement applicable to it;  and  
(vi) cooperate with Alliance in connection with the  performance by it of its
obligations hereunder;   (d) it shall:   (i) ensure that its authorized
and issued capital  includes one share of special voting stock of  Bowater,
which entitles the holder of record to a  number of votes at meetings of
holders of Bowater  Common Shares equal to the number of Exchangeable 
Shares outstanding from time to time; and   (ii) authorize Bowater Common
Shares to be issued in the  Arrangement and a sufficient number of Bowater
Common  Shares so that the retraction and exchange rights  attached to the
Exchangeable Shares may be honoured;   (e) in a timely and expeditious
manner, it shall provide to  Alliance all information as may be reasonably
requested by  Alliance or as required by the Interim Order or applicable 
Laws with respect to Bowater and its Subsidiaries and their  respective
businesses and properties for inclusion in the  Proxy Circular with respect
to the Alliance Meeting or in any  amendments or supplements to such Proxy
Circular complying in  all material respects with all applicable Laws on the
date of  mailing    22   Page 19   thereof and containing full, true
and plain disclosure of all  material facts relating to Bowater and not
containing any  misrepresentation (as defined under applicable securities 
laws) with respect thereto, Bowater agreeing to use its  commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information to  Alliance in a timely and
expeditious manner;   (f) it shall prepare and file with all applicable
Securities  Authorities all necessary applications to seek exemptions, if

Bowater Common  Shares pursuant to the Arrangement and the resale of such 
shares (other than by control persons and subject to  requirements of general
application) in, respectively, Canada  and the United States;   (g) it
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enable the  Exchangeable
Shares to be issued under the Arrangement to be  conditionally approved for
listing on The Toronto Stock  Exchange, subject to filing of required
documentation and  subject to meeting the listing requirements of The
Toronto  Stock Exchange;   (h) it shall:   (i) not take any action, or
permit any of its  Subsidiaries to take any action, that would interfere 
with or be inconsistent with the completion of the  transaction contemplated
hereunder or would render,  or that reasonably may be expected to render,
any  representation or warranty made by it in this  Agreement untrue in any
material respect at any time  prior to the Effective Date if then made;
and   (ii) promptly notify Alliance of any material adverse  change, or any
change which could reasonably be  expected to become a material adverse
change, in  respect of its or any of its Subsidiaries\' businesses  or in
the operation of its or any of its  Subsidiaries\' businesses or in the
operation of its  or any of its Subsidiaries\' properties, and of any 
material Governmental Entity or third party  complaints, investigations or
hearings (or  communications indicating that the same may be  contemplated);
and   (i) it shall conduct its affairs and shall cause its Subsidiaries  to
conduct their affairs so that all of its representations  and warranties

as of the Effective Date as if  made on and as of such date.    23  
Page 20  5.4. COVENANTS REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION   (a) Alliance shall
not, directly or indirectly, through any  officer, director, employee,
representative or agent of  Alliance or any of its Subsidiaries, solicit,
initiate or  knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing 
information or entering into any form of agreement,  arrangement or
understanding) the initiation of any inquiries  or proposals regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, participate in  any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition  Proposal, approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or  cause Alliance to enter into any agreement related to any 
Acquisition Proposal, or withdraw or modify in a manner  adverse to Bowater
the approval of the Board of Directors of  Alliance of the transaction
contemplated hereby; provided,  however, that subject to Section 5.5 but
notwithstanding the  preceding part of this Section 5.4(a) and any other
provision  of this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Board of  Directors
of Alliance from considering, negotiating,  approving, recommending to its
shareholders or entering into  an agreement in respect of an unsolicited bona
fide written  Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Alliance 
determines in good faith, after consultation with financial  advisors and
after receiving an opinion of outside counsel to  the effect that the Board
of Directors of Alliance is required  to take such action in order to
discharge properly its  fiduciary duties, would, if consummated in accordance
with its  terms, result in a transaction more favourable to Alliance\'s 
shareholders than the transaction contemplated by this  Agreement (any such
Acquisition Proposal being referred to  herein as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL");  
(b) Alliance shall promptly notify Bowater of any current  Acquisition
Proposals or of any future Acquisition Proposal of  which its directors or
senior officers become aware, or any  amendments to the foregoing, or any
request for non-public  information relating to Alliance or any of its
Subsidiaries in  connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to
the  properties, books or records of Alliance or any Subsidiary by  any
person or entity that informs Alliance or such Subsidiary  that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition  Proposal. Such notice shall
include a description of the  material terms and conditions of any proposal
and provide such  details of the proposal, inquiry or contact as Bowater
may  reasonably request including the identity of the person making  such
proposal, inquiry or contact;   (c) If Alliance receives a request for
material non-public  information from a person who proposes a bona fide
Acquisition  Proposal in respect of Alliance (the existence and content of 
which have been disclosed to Bowater), and the Board of  Directors of
Alliance determines that such proposal would be a  Superior Proposal pursuant
to Section 5.4(a) having received  the advice referred to therein, then, and
only in such case,  the Board of Directors of Alliance may, subject to the 
execution of a confidentiality agreement containing a  standstill provision
substantially similar to that contained  in Section 5.7, provide such person
with access to information  regarding Alliance; provided, however, that the
person making  the    24   Page 21   Acquisition Proposal shall not be
precluded thereunder from  making the Acquisition Proposal, and provided
further that  Alliance sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement
to  Bowater immediately upon its execution and Bowater is provided  with a
list of or copies of the information provided to such  person and is
immediately provided with access to similar  information to which such person
was provided, and provided  further that if the Confidentiality Agreement
does not contain  a standstill provision which is substantially similar to
that  contained in Section 5.7 and such provision is more favourable  to the
other party thereto than that contained in Section 5.7  in respect of
Bowater, the provisions of Section 5.7 as they  relate to Bowater and the
corresponding provisions of the  Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to
be amended to  include such more favourable terms; and   (d) Alliance shall
ensure that its officers, directors and  employees and its Subsidiaries and
any financial advisors or  other advisors or representatives retained by it
are aware of  the provisions of this Section 5.4, and it shall be 
responsible for any breach of this Section 5.4 by any of such 
persons.  5.5. NOTICE BY ALLIANCE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL DETERMINATION  
Alliance shall not accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement)
on the basis that it would constitute a Superior Proposal unless (a) it has
provided Bowater with a copy of the Acquisition Proposal document which the
Board of Directors of Alliance has determined would be a Superior
Proposal, and (b) five Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of the
date Bowater received notice of the proposed determination to accept,
approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such Acquisition
Proposal, and the date Bowater received a copy of the Acquisition Proposal
document. Such Acquisition Proposal document shall constitute confidential
Information for the purposes of Section 5.6(c) and Evaluation Material for
the purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.   During such five Business
Day period, Alliance acknowledges that Bowater shall have the opportunity,
but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement and the
Arrangement. The Board of Directors of Alliance will review any offer by
Bowater to amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to
determine, in its discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether
Bowater\'s offer upon acceptance by Alliance would result in the Acquisition
Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of Alliance
so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with Bowater
reflecting Bowater\'s amended proposal. If the Board of Directors of Alliance
determines that the Acquisition Proposal is nonetheless a Superior Proposal
Section 8.1 shall apply.   Alliance also acknowledges and agrees that each
successive modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the requirement under clause (b) of this
Section 5.5 to initiate an additional five Business Day notice period.  25 
Page 22   5.6. ACCESS TO INFORMATION   (a) Subject to Section 5.6(c) and
applicable Laws, upon reasonable  notice, Alliance shall (and shall cause
each of its  Subsidiaries to) afford Bowater\'s officers, employees, 
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives and  advisors
("REPRESENTATIVES") access, during normal business  hours from the date
hereof and until the earlier of the  Effective Date or the termination of
this Agreement, to its  properties, books, contracts and records as well as
to its  management personnel, consultants, customers, suppliers and  such
other persons as Bowater reasonably believes it has a  business purpose in
contacting (with full opportunity to  discuss the Alliance business including
its financial  condition, results of operation and prospects) and, during 
such period, Alliance shall (and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Bowater all information  (including photocopies thereof
when requested by Bowater)  concerning Alliance\'s business, properties,
personnel,  consultants, customers and suppliers as Bowater may reasonably 
request. Nothing in the foregoing shall require Alliance to  disclose
information subject to a written confidentiality  agreement with third
parties, or customer-specific or  competitively sensitive information
relating to areas or  projects where Bowater is a competitor. Bowater will
use its  commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Alliance prior  to
consultation with any third party with respect to whom  Bowater does not
otherwise have a business relationship in the  ordinary course of
business.   (b) Subject to Section 5.6(c) and applicable Laws, upon
reasonable  notice, Bowater shall afford Alliance\'s counsel and its 
financial advisors, BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. and Merrill Lynch and  Co, an
opportunity to conduct due diligence on Bowater and its  Subsidiaries to
enable each of them to prepare and deliver its  written fairness opinion.  
(c) The Parties acknowledge that certain information provided to  each other
under Section 5.6(a) and Section 5.6(b) above will  be non-public and/or
proprietary in nature (the  "INFORMATION"). Except as permitted below, each
Party will  keep Information confidential and will not, without the prior 
written consent of the other, disclose it, in any manner  whatsoever, in
whole or in part, to any other person, and  neither Party will use it for any
purpose other than to  evaluate the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. The  Parties will each make all reasonable, necessary and 
appropriate efforts to safeguard the Information from  disclosure to anyone
other than as permitted hereby and to  control the copies, extracts or
reproductions made of the  Information. The Information may be provided to
the  representatives of a Party who require access to the same to  assist it
in proceeding in good faith with the transaction  contemplated by this
Agreement, and whose assistance is  required for such purposes, provided that
such Party has first  informed such representatives to whom Information is
provided  that the representative has the same obligations, including as  to
confidentiality, restricted use and otherwise, that such  Party has with
respect to such Information. This provision  shall not apply as to such
portions of the    26   Page 23    Information that: (a) are or become
generally available to the  public other than as a result of disclosure by
the receiving  Party or its representatives; (b) become available to a
Party  on a non-confidential basis from a source other than, directly  or
indirectly, the other Party or its representatives,  provided that such
source is not to the knowledge of the  receiving Party, upon reasonable
inquiry, bound by a  confidentiality agreement with the Party providing the 
Information or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the  Information to the
receiving Party by a contractual, legal or  fiduciary obligation; (c) were
known to a Party or were in its  possession on a non-confidential basis prior
to being  disclosed to it by the Party providing the Information or by 
someone on its behalf; or (d) are required by applicable Laws  or court order
to be disclosed. The provisions of this Section  5.6(c) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.  5.7. MUTUAL STANDSTILL    During the
period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the later of: (a)
September 30, 2001; and (b) the earlier of (i) the Effective Date and (ii)
the termination of this Agreement, other than pursuant to this Agreement
(including without limitation Section 5.5), the Arrangement and
the transaction contemplated hereby, each Party agrees that it will not,
except in connection with this Agreement or the Arrangement or with the prior
approval of the other Party, which approval may be given on such terms as the
other Party may determine: (A) acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal
to acquire, in any manner, any securities or property of the other Party; (B)
assist, advise or encourage any other persons to acquire or agree to acquire,
in any manner, any security or property of the other Party; (C) solicit
proxies of the shareholders of the other Party or form, join in or in any way
participate in a proxy group with respect to the voting of any voting
securities of the other Party (but for greater certainty Alliance
acknowledges that Bowater and its agents and advisors (including Goldman,
Sachs and Co.) will be entitled to solicit proxies and otherwise influence any
person to vote in favour of the Arrangement at the Alliance Meeting and
Bowater acknowledges that Alliance and its agents and advisors (including BMO
Nesbitt Burns Inc. and Merrill Lynch and Co) will be entitled to solicit
proxies and otherwise influence any person to vote in favour of the
Arrangement at the Alliance Meeting); (D) seek any modification to or waiver
of the agreements and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, save
and except to the extent provided for in Section 5.4(c), or (E) make
any public announcement with respect to the foregoing, except as may be
required by applicable law or regulatory authorities. For the purpose of this
Section 5.7, a Party shall include Subsidiaries of such Party and their
successors. The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall be of no force or effect
against Bowater in the event that:   (a) a third party in no way related to
Bowater makes or enters  into an agreement to make a take-over bid to acquire
directly  or indirectly more than 50% of the then outstanding Alliance 
Common Shares or enters into an agreement with respect to an  amalgamation,
plan of arrangement or similar regrouping  combination to the same effect
involving Alliance; or that   (b) Bowater proposes to enter into a plan of
arrangement, or such  other form of transaction in virtue of which Bowater
proposes  to acquire directly or indirectly    27   Page 24    all of
the then outstanding Alliance Common Shares at a price  equal to or higher
than $26 per share payable in a combination  of up to 50% of the total
purchase price in cash and the  balance in Bowater Common Shares or in shares
of Bowater\'s  listed Canadian Subsidiary exchangeable into Bowater Common 
Shares.  5.8. INSURANCE   (a) Bowater shall ensure that the by-laws of
Alliance or of any  corporation continuing following any amalgamation,
merger,  plan of arrangement, consolidation or winding-up of Alliance  with
or into one or more other persons (a "SURVIVING  CORPORATION") shall contain
the provisions with respect to  indemnification now set forth in Alliance\'s
By-Laws (or as  provided in Article Eleventh of Bowater\'s Restated
Certificate  of Incorporation), which provision shall, unless required by 
Law, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a  period of six (6)
years from the Effective Date in any manner  that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of  individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective
Date, were  directors or officers of Alliance; and Bowater shall, subject 
to applicable Law, ensure that the obligations of Alliance  under any
indemnification agreements between Alliance and its  directors and officers
previously disclosed to Bowater in the  Alliance Disclosure Letter are
assumed by the Surviving  Corporation.   (b) Bowater agrees that from the
Effective Date until the sixth  anniversary of the Effective Date it will
maintain or cause  Alliance or any Surviving Corporation to maintain
Alliance\'s  current directors\' and officers\' insurance or another policy 
or "DISCOVERY" endorsement, on terms and conditions which are  no less
advantageous to the directors and officers of Alliance  and providing no less
coverage than Alliance\'s existing  directors\' and officers\' insurance, for
all present and former  directors and officers of Alliance, covering claims
made prior  to or within such period of time. At the election of Bowater 
and upon reasonable notice to Alliance, Alliance will acquire  the insurance
through a "DISCOVERY" endorsement referred to in  Section 5.2(k) of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Date;  and   (c) Alliance will not, and
Alliance will use its commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the insured
persons under such  directors\' and officers\' insurance policies not to,
take any  actions which might impair the coverage thereunder or cause an 
increase in the premiums therefor.  5.9. ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS   The
Parties agree that the support agreement and the voting and exchange trust
agreement referenced in the provisions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares
set out on Exhibit 1 to Schedule A annexed hereto shall apply to the
Arrangement contemplated herein.    28   Page 25   5.10. MERGER OF
COVENANTS   The covenants set out in this Agreement (except for Sections
5.6(c), 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 8.1 and 10.1 which shall survive the completion of
the Arrangement) shall not survive the completion of the Arrangement, and
shall expire and be terminated without recourse between the Parties upon
such completion.   ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS  6.1. MUTUAL CONDITIONS

to the filing of the Final Order for acceptance by the Director, the Party
intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants,
representations and warranties or other matters which the Party delivering
such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment of the
applicable condition precedent or termination right, as the case may be. If

to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured, the other
Party may not terminate this Agreement until the later of September 30, 2001

shall have  provided its written confirmation, in form and substance 
acceptable to Bowater (the written authorization and  confirmation of SDI
being referred to collectively as the "SDI  CONSENT") that such change of
control shall not constitute a  default under the Credit Agreement (the "SDI
AGREEMENT")  between SDI and Alliance dated July 8, 1998, nor shall there 
be, as a result of such change of control, any premium,  penalty or other
payment owing by Alliance or its successors,  pursuant to the SDI Agreement;
for certainty, Alliance will be  in the same position under the SDI Agreement
after the change  of control provided by this Agreement as before such
change.   (b) If any of the said conditions shall not be complied with or 
waived by Bowater on or before June 18, 2001, Bowater shall be  permitted to
rescind and terminate this Agreement by written  notice to Alliance. The
foregoing conditions are for the sole  benefit of Bowater and may be waived
by it in writing at any  time, in whole or in part, and on such terms as it
may  prescribe. A termination of this Agreement as a result of the  failure
of Alliance to obtain the SDI Consent shall not result  in the occurrence of
a Bowater Break Fee Event pursuant to  Section 8.1 of this Agreement.  
ARTICLE 7   AMENDMENT  7.1. AMENDMENT   This Agreement may, at any time

performance of any of the obligations or  acts of the Parties;   (b) waive
any inaccuracies or modify any representation contained  herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto;   (c) waive compliance with or modify

right to utilize a Subsidiary other than Bowater Canada for the purpose
of issuing shares which are exchangeable for Bowater Common Stock in the
place and stead of Bowater Canada and in such instance, all references herein
to Exchangeable Shares shall be to the exchangeable shares of such Subsidiary
and all references to Bowater Canada shall be deemed to refer to such
Subsidiary and the representations and warranties with respect to Bowater
Canada contained in Schedule C hereof shall be amended in accordance with the
terms hereof in order to refer to such Subsidiary. Any such utilization of an
alternate subsidiary shall provide the Alliance Common Shareholders with the
same rights and privileges as those initially contemplated.  7.2. MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING REGARDING AMENDMENTS   The Parties will continue from and
after the date hereof and through and including the Effective Date, to use
their respective best efforts to maximize present and future financial and
tax planning opportunities for the shareholders of Alliance, for Bowater and
its Subsidiaries, and for Alliance as and to the extent that the same shall
not prejudice any Party or its securityholders. The Parties will ensure that
such planning activities do not impede the progress of the Arrangement in any
material way. Any proposals made in respect of the foregoing will be subject
to continued good faith discussions between the parties.   The Parties
mutually agree that if a Party proposes any amendment or amendments to this
Agreement or to the Plan of Arrangement, the other Party will act reasonably
in considering such amendment and if the other Party and its shareholders are
not prejudiced by reason of any such amendment the other Party will co-
operate in a reasonable fashion with the Party proposing the amendment so
that such amendment can be effected subject to applicable Laws and the
rights of the securityholders.   ARTICLE 8   AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND

lieu of any such fractional securities:   (a) each Person otherwise entitled
to a fractional  interest in an Exchangeable Share will receive a cash 
payment equal to such Person\'s pro rata portion of  the net proceeds after
expenses received by the  Depositary upon the sale of whole shares
representing  an accumulation of all fractional interests in  Exchangeable
Shares to which all such Persons would  otherwise be entitled. The Depositary
will sell such  Exchangeable Shares by private sale (including by way  of
sale through the facilities of any stock exchange  upon which the
Exchangeable Shares are then listed)  as soon as reasonably practicable
following the  Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after  expenses of
such sale will be distributed by the  Depositary, pro rata in relation to the
respective  fractions, among the Persons otherwise entitled to  receive
fractional interests in Exchangeable Shares;  and   (b) each person
otherwise entitled to a fractional  interest in a Bowater Common Share will
receive a  cash payment equal to such Person\'s pro rata portion  of the net
proceeds after expenses received by the  Depositary upon the sale of whole
shares representing  an accumulation of all fractional interests in  Bowater
Common Shares to which all such Persons would  otherwise be entitled. The
Depositary will sell such  Bowater Common Shares on the NYSE as soon as 
practicable following the Effective Date. The  aggregate net proceeds after
expenses of such sale  will be distributed by the Depositary, pro rata in 
relation to the respective fractions, among the  Persons otherwise entitled
to receive fractional  interests in Bowater Common Shares.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Bowater Canada or Bowater, respectively, shall be entitled to
deposit cash with the Depositary to enable the Depositary to make cash
payments provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, in which case
the Exchangeable Shares or Bowater Common Shares, as the case may be, that
would otherwise be sold by the Depositary will be surrendered to Bowater
Canada or Bowater or no such shares will be issued.  4.5 LOST
CERTIFICATES   In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Alliance Common Shares
that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the    50  
Page 9  Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, cash and certificates representing, as applicable, Exchangeable
Shares or Bowater Common Shares (and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash pursuant to Section 4.3) deliverable in
accordance with such holder\'s Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person
to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares or Bowater Common
Shares are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Bowater Canada or Bowater, as the case
may be, in such sum as Bowater Canada or Bowater may, acting reasonably,
direct or otherwise indemnify Bowater Canada or Bowater in a
manner satisfactory to Bowater Canada or Bowater, acting reasonably, against
any claim that may be made against Bowater Canada or Bowater with respect to
the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.  4.6
EXTINCTION OF RIGHTS   Any certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Alliance Common Shares that were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 and not deposited, with all other
instruments required by Section 4.1 or 4.2, on or prior to the third
anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of Bowater Canada or Bowater.
On such date, the Exchangeable Shares or Bowater Common Shares to which the
former registered holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding
sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to
Bowater Canada or Bowater, as the case may be, together with all entitlements
to dividends, distributions and interest thereon held for such former
registered holder.  4.7 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS   Bowater Holdings, Bowater
Canada, Bowater and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable under this Plan of
Arrangement to any holder of Alliance Common Shares, Bowater Common Shares or
Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Bowater Canada, Bowater Holdings, Bowater
or the Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under the Income Tax Act (Canada), the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of provincial, state, local or
foreign tax law, in each case as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts
are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that
the amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld from any
payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise
payable to the holder, Bowater Holdings, Bowater Canada, Bowater and the
Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion
of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Bowater
Holdings, Bowater    51   Page 10  Canada, Bowater or the Depositary,
as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirement and Bowater Holdings, Bowater Canada, Bowater or the Depositary
shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale.   ARTICLE 5   CERTAIN RIGHTS OF BOWATER HOLDINGS TO
ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES  5.1 BOWATER HOLDINGS CALL RIGHTS   By virtue
of the Arrangement and the Exchangeable Share Provisions, each holder of
Alliance Common Shares who receives Exchangeable Shares under
the Arrangement, and the assignees from time to time of such Exchangeable
Shares, shall be subject to the Liquidation Call Right and the Redemption
Call Right of Bowater Holdings as referred to in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions and, for the purposes of this Plan of Arrangement, set out
verbatim in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Capitalized terms used in Sections 5.2 and
5.3 and not otherwise defined in this Plan of Arrangement shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in the Exchangeable Share Provisions. In addition,
such holders and their assignees as aforesaid shall be subject to all other
rights of Bowater Holdings contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions,
including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the
Exchangeable Share Provisions).  5.2 LIQUIDATION CALL RIGHT   (a) Bowater
Holdings shall have the overriding right (the  "Liquidation Call Right"), in
the event of and  notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution  or
winding-up of Bowater Canada pursuant to Article 5  of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions, to purchase  from all but not less than all of the holders of 
Exchangeable Shares on the Liquidation Date all but  not less than all of the
Exchangeable Shares held by  each such holder on payment by Bowater Holdings
of an  amount per share equal to (a) the Current Market  Price (as defined
in the Exchangeable Share  Provisions) of a Bowater Common Share on the
last  Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which  shall be satisfied
in full by causing to be delivered  to such holder one Bowater Common Share,
plus (b) the  right to receive the full amount when paid of all  unpaid
dividends on such Exchangeable Share for which  the record date has occurred
prior to Liquidation  Date (collectively the "Liquidation Call Purchase 
Price"). In the event of the exercise of the  Liquidation Call Right by
Bowater Holdings, each  holder shall be obligated to sell all the 
Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Bowater  Holdings on the
Liquidation Date on payment by  Bowater Holdings to the holder of the
Liquidation  Call Purchase Price for each such share.   (b) To exercise the
Liquidation Call Right, Bowater  Holdings must notify Bowater Canada\'s
transfer agent  (the "Transfer Agent"), as agent for the holders of 
Exchangeable Shares, and Bowater Canada of Bowater    52   Page 11  
Holdings\' intention to exercise such right at least  45 days before the
Liquidation Date in the case of a  voluntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of  Bowater Canada and at least five Business Days before  the
Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary  liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of Bowater  Canada. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders
of  Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Bowater  Holdings has exercised
the Liquidation Call Right  forthwith after the expiry of the period during
which  the same may be exercised by Bowater Holdings. If  Bowater Holdings
exercises the Liquidation Call  Right, then on the Liquidation Date Bowater
Holdings  will purchase and the holders will sell all of the  Exchangeable
Shares then outstanding for a price per  share equal to the Liquidation Call
Purchase Price.   (c) For the purposes of completing the purchase of the 
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call  Right, Bowater Holdings
shall deposit with the  Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, 
certificates representing the aggregate number of  Bowater Common Shares
deliverable by Bowater Holdings  in payment of the total Liquidation Call
Purchase  Price and shall waive any rights to receive any  dividends which
represent the amount of the remaining  portion, if any, of the total
Liquidation Call  Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to 
Section 4.7 hereof. Provided that Bowater Holdings  has complied with the
immediately preceding sentence,  on and after the Liquidation Date the rights
of each  holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to  receiving such
holder\'s proportionate part of the  total Liquidation Call Purchase Price
payable by  Bowater Holdings (which in the case of unpaid  dividends, if
any, shall be satisfied by the payment  thereof by Bowater Canada on the
payment date for  such dividends) upon presentation and surrender by  the
holder of certificates representing the  Exchangeable Shares held by such
holder and the  holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be 
considered and deemed for all purposes to be the  holder of the Bowater
Common Shares to which it is  entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent
of a  certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable  Shares,
together with such other documents and  instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer  of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws  of
Bowater Canada and such additional documents and  instruments as the Transfer
Agent may reasonably  require, the holder of such surrendered certificate 
or certificates shall be entitled to receive in  exchange therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf  of Bowater Holdings shall deliver to such holder, 
certificates representing the Bowater Common Shares  to which the holder is
entitled and on the applicable  dividend payment date a cheque or cheques
payable at  par at any branch of the bankers of Bowater Canada in  Canada in
payment of the remaining portion, if any,  of the total Liquidation Call
Purchase Price less any  amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof.
If  Bowater Holdings does not exercise the Liquidation  Call Right in the
manner described above, on the  Liquidation Date the holders of the
Exchangeable  Shares    53   Page 12   will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the  liquidation price otherwise payable by Bowater
Canada  in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or  winding-up of
Bowater Canada pursuant to Article 5 of  the Exchangeable Share
Provisions.  5.3 REDEMPTION CALL RIGHT   (a) Bowater Holdings shall have
the overriding right (the  "Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding the 
proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by  Bowater Canada pursuant to
Article 7 of the  Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all  but
not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable  Shares on the Redemption
Date all but not less than  all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each
such  holder on payment by Bowater Holdings to the holder  of an amount per
share equal to (a) the Current  Market Price (as defined in the Exchangeable
Share  Provisions) of a Bowater Common Share on the last  Business Day prior
to the Redemption Date, which  shall be satisfied in full by causing to be
delivered  to such holder one Bowater Common Share plus (b) the  right to
receive the full amount when paid of all  unpaid dividends on such
Exchangeable Share for which  the record date has occurred prior to the
Redemption  Date (collectively the "Redemption Call Purchase  Price"). In
the event of the exercise of the  Redemption Call Right by Bowater Holdings,
each  holder shall be obligated to sell all the  Exchangeable Shares held by
the holder to Bowater  Holdings on the Redemption Date on payment by
Bowater  Holdings to the holder of the Redemption Call  Purchase Price for
each such share.   (b) To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Bowater 
Holdings must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for  the holders of
Exchangeable Shares, and Bowater  Canada of Bowater Holdings\' intention to
exercise  such right at least 60 days before the Redemption  Date, except in
the case of a redemption occurring as  a result of an acquisition of Control
of Bowater (as  defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in  which case
Bowater Holdings shall notify the Transfer  Agent and Bowater Canada on or
before the Redemption  Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of 
the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Bowater  Holdings has exercised
the Redemption Call Right  forthwith after the expiry of the period during
which  the same may be exercised by Bowater Holdings. If  Bowater Holdings
exercises the Redemption Call Right,  on the Redemption Date Bowater Holdings
will purchase  and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable  Shares
then outstanding for a price per share equal  to the Redemption Call Purchase
Price.   (c) For the purposes of completing the purchase of the 
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call  Right, Bowater Holdings
shall deposit with the  Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, 
certificates representing the aggregate number of  Bowater Common
Shares    54   Page 13   deliverable by Bowater Holdings in payment of
the  total Redemption Call Purchase Price and shall waive  any rights to
receive any dividends which represent  the amount of the remaining portion,
if any, of the  total Redemption Call Purchase Price less any amounts 
withheld pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof. Provided  that Bowater Holdings has
complied with the immediate  preceding sentence, on and after the Redemption
Date  the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will  be limited to
receiving such holder\'s proportionate  part of the total Redemption Call
Purchase Price  payable by Bowater Holdings (which in case of unpaid 
dividends, if any, shall be satisfied by the payment  thereof by Bowater
Canada on the payment date for  such dividends) upon presentation and
surrender by  the holder of certificates representing the  Exchangeable
Shares held by such holder and the  holder shall on and after the Redemption
Date be  considered and deemed for all purposes to be the  holder of the
Bowater Common Shares to which it is  entitled. Upon surrender to the
Transfer Agent of a  certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable 
Shares, together with such other documents and  instruments as may be
required to effect a transfer  of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the
by-laws  of Bowater Canada and such additional documents and  instruments as
the Transfer Agent may reasonably  require, the holder of such surrendered
certificate  or certificates shall be entitled to receive in  exchange
therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf  of Bowater Holdings shall deliver
to such holder,  certificates representing the Bowater Common Shares  to
which the holder is entitled and on the applicable  dividend payment date a
cheque or cheques payable at  par at any branch of the bankers of Bowater
Canada in  Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any,  of the total
Redemption Call Purchase Price less any  amounts withheld pursuant to Section
4.7 hereof. If  Bowater Holdings does not exercise the Redemption  Call
Right in the manner described above, on the  Redemption Date the holders of
the Exchangeable  Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor
the redemption price otherwise payable by  Bowater Canada in connection with
the redemption of  the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7 of the 
Exchangeable Share Provisions.   ARTICLE 6   AMENDMENTS  6.1 AMENDMENTS

DIVIDENDS   3.1 A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to
receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each
Bowater Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Exchangeable
Share:   (a) in the case of a cash dividend declared on the  Bowater Common
Shares, in an amount in cash for each  Exchangeable Share in U.S. dollars or
the Canadian  Dollar Equivalent thereof on the Bowater Dividend  Declaration
Date of the cash dividend declared on  each Bowater Common Share;   (b) in
the case of a stock dividend declared on the  Bowater Common Shares to be
paid in Bowater Common  Shares, in such number of Exchangeable Shares for 
each Exchangeable Share as is equal to the number of  Bowater Common Shares
to be paid on each Bowater  Common Share; or    60  -5-    (c) in the
case of a dividend declared on the Bowater  Common Shares in property other
than cash or Bowater  Common Shares, in such type and amount of property 
for each Exchangeable Share as is the same as or  economically equivalent to
(to be determined by the  Board of Directors as contemplated by Section 3.5 
hereof) the type and amount of property declared as a  dividend on each
Bowater Common Share.  Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or
property of Bowater Canada properly applicable to the payment of dividends,
or out of authorized but unissued shares of Bowater Canada, as
applicable.   3.2 Cheques of Bowater Canada payable at par at any branch of
the bankers of Bowater Canada shall be issued in respect of any cash

contemplated by Section 3.1(b) hereof and the sending of such a certificate
to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock dividend
represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in respect of any
dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(c) hereof shall be issued, distributed
or transferred by Bowater Canada in such manner as it shall determine and the
issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by Bowater Canada to each holder
of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend represented thereby. No
holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or
other legal process against Bowater Canada any dividend that is represented
by a cheque that has not been duly presented to Bowater Canada\'s bankers for
payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from
the date on which such dividend was payable.   3.3 The record date for the
determination of the holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive
payment of, and the payment date for, any dividend declared on the
Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof shall be the same dates as the
record date and payment date, respectively, for the corresponding dividend
declared on the Bowater Common Shares.   3.4 If on any payment date for any
dividends declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof the
dividends are not paid in full on all of the Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding, any such dividends that remain unpaid shall be paid on a
subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of Directors on which
Bowater Canada shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property properly
applicable to the payment of such dividends.   3.5 The Board of Directors
shall determine, in good faith and in its sole discretion (with the
assistance of such reputable and qualified independent financial advisors
and/or other experts as the Board of Directors may require), economic
equivalence for the purposes of Section 3.1(c) hereof, and each such
determination shall be conclusive and binding on Bowater Canada and its
shareholders. In making each such determination, the following
factors shall,    61  -6-   without excluding other factors determined
by the Board of Directors to be relevant, be considered by the Board of
Directors:   (a) in the case of any stock dividend or other  distribution
payable in Bowater Common Shares, the  number of such shares issued in
proportion to the  number of Bowater Common Shares previously 
outstanding;   (b) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any 
rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or  purchase Bowater Common
Shares (or securities  exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying 
rights to acquire Bowater Common Shares), the  relationship between the
exercise price of each such  right, option or warrant and the current market
value  (as determined by the Board of Directors in the  manner above
contemplated) of a Bowater Common Share;   (c) in the case of the issuance
or distribution of any  other form of property (including without
limitation  any shares or securities of Bowater of any class  other than
Bowater Common Shares, any rights, options  or warrants other than those
referred to in Section  3.5(b) above, any evidences of indebtedness of 
Bowater or any assets of Bowater), the relationship  between the fair market
value (as determined by the  Board of Directors in the manner above
contemplated)  of such property to be issued or distributed with  respect to
each outstanding Bowater Common Share and  the current market value (as
determined by the Board  of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of
a  Bowater Common Share; and   (d) in all such cases, the general taxation
consequences  of the relevant event to holders of Exchangeable  Shares to
the extent that such consequences may  differ from the taxation consequences
to holders of  Bowater Common Shares as a result of differences  between
taxation laws of Canada and the United States  (except for any differing
consequences arising as a  result of differing marginal taxation rates and 
without regard to the individual circumstances of  holders of Exchangeable
Shares).   For purposes of the foregoing determinations, the current market
value of any security listed and traded or quoted on a securities exchange
shall be the weighted average of the daily trading prices of such security
during a period of not less than 20 consecutive trading days ending not more
than five trading days before the date of determination on the principal
securities exchange on which such securities are listed and traded or quoted;
provided, however, that if in the opinion of the Board of Directors the
public distribution or trading activity of such securities during such period
does not create a market which reflects the fair market value of such
securities, then the current market value thereof shall be determined by the
Board of Directors, in good faith and in its sole discretion (with the
assistance of such reputable and qualified independent financial advisors
and/or other experts as the board may require), and provided further that any
such determination by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding
on Bowater Canada and its shareholders.    62  -7-    ARTICLE 4  
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS   4.1 So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are
outstanding, Bowater Canada shall not at any time without, but may at any
time with, the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as
specified in Section 10.2 of these share provisions:   (a) pay any
dividends on the Common Shares, the Preferred  Shares or any other shares
ranking junior to the  Exchangeable Shares, other than stock dividends 
payable in Common Shares or any such other shares  ranking junior to the
Exchangeable Shares, as the  case may be;   (b) redeem or purchase or make
any capital distribution  in respect of Common Shares, Preferred Shares or
any  other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable  Shares;   (c) redeem
or purchase any other shares of Bowater Canada  ranking equally with the
Exchangeable Shares with  respect to the payment of dividends or on any 
liquidation distribution; or   (d) issue any Exchangeable Shares or any
other shares of  Bowater Canada ranking equally with, or superior to,  the
Exchangeable Shares other than by way of stock  dividends to the holders of
such Exchangeable Shares.   The restrictions in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b),
4.1(c) and 4.1(d) above shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding
Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends declared and paid to date on
the Bowater Common Shares shall have been declared and paid in full on the
Exchangeable Shares.   ARTICLE 5   DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION   5.1 In
the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Bowater Canada or
any other distribution of the assets of Bowater Canada among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares
shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of
Bowater Canada in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on
the effective date (the "Liquidation Date") of such liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up, before any distribution of any part of the assets of Bowater
Canada among the holders of the Common Shares, the Preferred Shares or any
other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per
share (the "Liquidation Amount") equal to:   (a) the Current Market Price
of a Bowater Common Share on  the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation
Date,  which shall be satisfied in full by Bowater Canada  causing to be
delivered to such holder one Bowater  Common Share; plus    63  -8-   
(b) the right to receive the full amount when paid of all  unpaid dividends
on each such Exchangeable Share for  which the record date has occurred prior
to the  Liquidation Date.   5.2 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date,
and subject to the exercise by Bowater Holdings of the Liquidation Call
Right, Bowater Canada shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share
upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Canada
Business Corporations Act and the by-laws of Bowater Canada and such
additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
require, at the registered office of Bowater Canada or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by Bowater Canada by notice to the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of the holder recorded in the securities register of Bowater Canada for the
Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered
office of Bowater Canada or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by Bowater Canada by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
on behalf of Bowater Canada of certificates representing Bowater
Common Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-
assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and
on the applicable dividend payment date a cheque of Bowater Canada payable at
par at any branch of the bankers of Bowater Canada in respect of the full
amount of any unpaid dividends comprising part of the total Liquidation
Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to
be deducted and withheld therefrom by Bowater Canada). On and after the
Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be
holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive
their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of
the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made
upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the manner
hereinbefore provided. Bowater Canada shall have the right at any time after
the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by
certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by
the holders thereof in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders
of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to receiving
their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount (in each case less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and
withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against
presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them,
respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment
or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be
holders of the Bowater Common Shares delivered to them or the custodian on
their behalf.   5.3 After Bowater Canada has satisfied its obligations to
pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per
Exchangeable Share pursuant to Section 5.1 of    64  -9-   these share
provisions, such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further
distribution of the assets of Bowater Canada.   ARTICLE 6   RETRACTION OF
EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER   6.1 A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled at any time, subject to the exercise by Bowater Holdings of the
Retraction Call Right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of
this Article 6, to require Bowater Canada to redeem any or all of the
Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per
share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Bowater Common Share on the
last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date, which shall be satisfied in
full by Bowater Canada causing to be delivered to such holder one Bowater
Common Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the
holder, plus (b) the right to receive the full amount when paid of all unpaid
dividends thereon for which the record date for such dividends has occurred
prior to the Retraction Date (collectively the "Retraction Price"). To effect
such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at the registered
office of Bowater Canada or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by Bowater Canada by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares
the certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which
the holder desires to have Bowater Canada redeem, together with such other
documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under the Canada Business Corporations Act and the by-
laws of Bowater Canada and such additional documents and instruments as the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require, and together with a duly
executed statement (the "Retraction Request") in the form of Schedule A
hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to Bowater Canada:   (a)
specifying that the holder desires to have all or any  number specified
therein of the Exchangeable Shares  represented by such certificate or
certificates (the  "Retracted Shares") redeemed by Bowater Canada;   (b)
stating the Business Day on which the holder desires  to have Bowater Canada
redeem the Retracted Shares  (the "Retraction Date"), provided that the
Retraction  Date shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more  than 15
Business Days after the date on which the  Retraction Request is received by
Bowater Canada and  further provided that, in the event that no such 
Business Day is specified by the holder in the  Retraction Request, the
Retraction Date shall be  deemed to be the fifteenth Business Day after the 
date on which the Retraction Request is received by  Bowater Canada; and  
(c) acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction  Call Right") of
Bowater Holdings to purchase all but  not less than all the Retracted Shares
directly from  the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be  deemed
to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell  the Retracted Shares to
Bowater Holdings in  accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the  terms
and conditions set out in Section 6.3 below.    65  -10-    6.2 Subject
to the exercise by Bowater Holdings of the Retraction Call Right, upon
receipt by Bowater Canada or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in
Section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number
of Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have Bowater Canada
redeem, together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction
Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7,
Bowater Canada shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of
business on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to
such holder the total Retraction Price with respect to such shares (provided
that any unpaid dividends forming part of the Retraction Price shall be paid
on the payment date for such dividends). If only a part of the Exchangeable
Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by Bowater
Holdings pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the
balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the
expense of Bowater Canada.   6.3 Upon receipt by Bowater Canada of a
Retraction Request, Bowater Canada shall immediately notify Bowater and
Bowater Holdings thereof. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right,
Bowater Holdings must notify Bowater Canada of its determination to do so
(the "Bowater Holdings Call Notice") within five Business Days of
notification to Bowater Holdings by Bowater Canada of the receipt by Bowater
Canada of the Retraction Request. If Bowater Holdings delivers the Bowater
Holdings Call Notice within such five Business Day time period, and provided
that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner
specified in Section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be
considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to
Bowater Holdings in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event,
Bowater Canada shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Bowater Holdings
shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Bowater
Holdings on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for a purchase price
(the "Purchase Price") per share equal to the Retraction Price per share. For
the purposes of completing a purchase pursuant to the Retraction Call
Right, Bowater Holdings shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before
the Retraction Date, certificates representing Bowater Common Shares and
shall waive any rights to receive any dividends which represent the amount of
the remaining portion, if any, of the total Purchase Price (in each case less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom by Bowater Holdings). Provided that Bowater Holdings has complied
with the immediately preceding sentence, the closing of the purchase and sale
of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed
to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for
greater certainty, no redemption by Bowater Canada of such Retracted Shares
shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event that Bowater Holdings
does not deliver a Bowater Holdings Call Notice within such five Business Day
period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder
in the manner specified in Section 6.7, Bowater Canada shall redeem the
Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise
contemplated in this Article 6.   6.4 Bowater Canada or Bowater Holdings, as
the case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the
relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities
register of Bowater Canada for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address
specified in the holder\'s Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by
the holder at the registered office of Bowater Canada or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by Bowater Canada by notice to the holders
of Exchangeable Shares, certificates representing the Bowater Common    
66  -11-   Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and
non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance)
registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may
request in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price,
as the case may be, and on the applicable dividend payment date a cheque
payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Bowater Canada in payment of
the remaining portion, if any, of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be (in each case less any amounts withheld on
account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom), and such
delivery of such certificates and cheque on behalf of Bowater Canada or by
Bowater Holdings, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be
deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the
extent that the same is represented by such share certificates and cheque
(plus any tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax
authority), unless such cheque is not paid on due presentation.   6.5 On
and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of the
Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total
Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless
upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in Section
6.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until
the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of
business on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of
certificates and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase
Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by Bowater Canada
or purchased by Bowater Holdings shall thereafter be considered and deemed
for all purposes to be a holder of the Bowater Common Shares delivered to
it.   6.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6,
Bowater Canada shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by
a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of
Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other
provisions of applicable law. If Bowater Canada believes that on any
Retraction Date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem
the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that
Bowater Holdings shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with
respect to the Retracted Shares, Bowater Canada shall only be obligated to
redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the
extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole
number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall
notify the holder at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as
to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by Bowater
Canada. In any case in which the redemption by Bowater Canada of Retracted
Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of
applicable law, Bowater Canada shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance
with Section 6.2 of these share provisions on a pro rata basis and shall
issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of
Bowater Canada, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by
Bowater Canada pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof. Provided that the Retraction
Request is not    67  -12-   revoked by the holder in the manner
specified in Section 6.7, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not
redeemed by Bowater Canada pursuant to Section 6.2 of these share provisions
as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law shall be deemed by
giving the Retraction Request to require Bowater to purchase such Retracted
Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter on payment by Bowater to such holder of the Purchase Price for
each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the Voting
and Exchange Trust Agreement.   6.7 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by
notice in writing given by the holder to Bowater Canada before the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date,
withdraw its Retraction Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall
be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted
by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Bowater Holdings
shall be deemed to have been revoked.   ARTICLE 7   REDEMPTION OF
EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY BOWATER CANADA   7.1 Subject to applicable law, and
provided Bowater Holdings has not exercised the Redemption Call Right,
Bowater Canada shall on the Redemption Date redeem the whole of the then
outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to (a) the
Current Market Price of a Bowater Common Share on the last Business Day prior
to the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Bowater Canada
causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Bowater
Common Share for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, plus (b) the
right to receive the full amount when paid of all unpaid dividends thereon
for which the record date has occurred prior to the Redemption
Date (collectively, the "Redemption Price").   7.2 In any case of a
redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7, Bowater Canada shall,
at least 60 days before the Redemption Date, send or cause to be sent to each
holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by
Bowater Canada or the purchase by Bowater Holdings under the Redemption Call
Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder;
provided, however, that in the event of a redemption of the Exchangeable
Shares at the election of the Board of Directors (or a purchase by Bowater
Holdings as a result thereof) upon a transaction being proposed that would
result in Control of Bowater being acquired by any Person, Bowater
Canada shall cause such notice to be sent at least the number of days prior
to the Redemption Date established by the Board of Directors as the Board of
Directors determines to be reasonably practicable under the circumstances;
provided further, however, that in each case the accidental failure or
omission to give such notice to fewer than 10% of the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall not affect the validity of such notice of
redemption. In either case, such notice shall set out the formula for
determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as
the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the
Redemption Call Right.   7.3 On or after the Redemption Date and subject to
the exercise by Bowater Holdings of the Redemption Call Right, Bowater Canada
shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the    68 
-13-   Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each
such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender at the registered
office of Bowater Canada or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by Bowater Canada in such notice of the certificates representing
such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments
as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the
Canada Business Corporations Act and the by-laws of Bowater Canada and such
additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares
shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder
recorded in the securities register of Bowater Canada or by holding for pick-
up by the holder at the registered office of Bowater Canada or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by Bowater Canada in such notice,
on behalf of Bowater Canada of certificates representing Bowater Common
Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable
and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and on the
applicable dividend payment date a cheque of Bowater Canada payable at par at
any branch of the bankers of Bowater Canada in respect of the full amount of
any unpaid dividends comprising part of the total Redemption Price (in each
case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be withheld and
remitted therefrom by Bowater Canada). On and after the Redemption Date, the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be
holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive
their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price, unless payment of the
total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon
presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected
until the total Redemption Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore
provided. Bowater Canada shall have the right at any time after the sending
of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to
deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price of
the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the
said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the
date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection
with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada named in such notice (less any amounts withheld on account
of tax required to be withheld and remitted therefrom by Bowater Canada).
Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the
Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made
shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or
Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their
proportionate part of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares
so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates
held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon
such payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be holders of the Bowater Common Shares delivered to them or the
custodian on their behalf.   ARTICLE 8   PURCHASE FOR CANCELLATION   8.1
Subject to applicable law and the articles of Bowater Canada, Bowater Canada
may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any
part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at any price by tender to all the
holders of record of Exchangeable Shares    69  -14-   then outstanding
or through the facilities of any stock exchange on which the Exchangeable
Shares are listed or quoted at any price per share together with an amount
equal to all declared and unpaid dividends thereon for which the record date
has occurred prior to the date of purchase. If in response to an
invitation for tenders under the provisions of this Section 8.1, more
Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or prices acceptable to Bowater
Canada than Bowater Canada is prepared to purchase, the Exchangeable Shares
to be purchased by Bowater Canada shall be purchased as nearly as may be pro
rata according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a
tender to Bowater Canada, provided that when shares are tendered at different
prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions) only with
respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more shares were
tendered than Bowater Canada is prepared to purchase after Bowater Canada has
purchased all the shares tendered at lower prices. If part only of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate shall be purchased, a new
certificate for the balance of such shares shall be issued at the expense of
Bowater Canada.   ARTICLE 9   VOTING RIGHTS   9.1 Except as required by
applicable law, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled
as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of
Bowater Canada or to vote at any such meeting.   ARTICLE 10   AMENDMENT

Exchangeable Shares to add to, change or remove any right, privilege,
restriction or condition attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other
matter requiring the approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it shall have been
given in accordance with applicable law subject to a minimum requirement that
such approval be evidenced by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds
of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders of Exchangeable
Shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least 25% of the

proxy; provided that if at any such meeting the holders of at least 25% of
the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at that time are not present or
represented by proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such
meeting then the meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than five
days thereafter and to such time and place as may be designated by the
Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting the holders of
Exchangeable Shares present or represented by proxy thereat may transact the
business for which the meeting was originally called and a resolution passed
thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast
on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent

required regulatory authorities.   (d) The Alliance Plans are intended to
qualify under Section 401  of the Code or registered under the Income Tax Act

have been determined to be so qualified or so registered and  exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501 of the  Code or under the Income
Tax Act (Canada), as applicable, and  nothing has occurred with respect to
the operation of the  Alliance Plans which is reasonably likely to cause the
loss of  such qualification, exemption or registration, as applicable,  or
the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax  under ERISA, the
Code, the Income Tax Act (Canada) or  provincial pension legislation, as
applicable, except where  there would be no material liability for failure to
make such  qualifications.   (e) To the best of Alliance\'s knowledge, all
contributions  (including all employer contributions and employee salary

made in the ordinary course), nor does Alliance have knowledge  of facts
which could form the basis for any such Legal  Proceeding.   (g) Except as
disclosed in the Alliance Disclosure Letter, none of  the Alliance Plans
provide for post-retirement or  post-employment life or health insurance,
benefit or coverage  for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant,  except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.   (h) No step has been taken,
no event has occurred and no condition  or circumstance exists that has
resulted in or could  reasonably be expected to result in any Alliance Plan
being  ordered or required to be terminated or wound up in whole or  in part

regulatory  authority or being required to pay any material Taxes, fees,

Alliance Plan, to the  effect that the assets of any such plan (or any
predecessor  plan whose assets and liabilities have been transferred to 
such Alliance Plan) must be used exclusively for the provision  of benefits
to Employees or former employees of Alliance or  its Subsidiaries, and cannot
revert to Alliance or its  Subsidiaries, as applicable.    86   SCHEDULE
B  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ALLIANCE  PAGE 10     (m) Except as

Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in violation of any applicable
Laws other than non-compliance or violations which would not individually or
in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on Alliance or any of its
Subsidiaries.  20. Licenses, Etc. Alliance and each of its Subsidiaries
owns, possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance with, all licenses,
permits (including permits required under Environmental Laws), certificates,
orders, grants and other authorizations of or from any Governmental Entity

possess, obtain or be in compliance with which would not individually or in
the aggregate have a material adverse effect on Alliance or any of its
Subsidiaries.  21. Contracts. The Alliance Disclosure Letter contains a list
of all contracts, leases, agreements, commitments, obligations and
arrangements, written or oral, of any nature or kind, which provide for
ongoing obligations of Alliance or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Non-

would be conducted.  23. Insurance Matters. Alliance is not aware at the
date of this Agreement of any reason why insurance through a "DISCOVERY"
endorsement which protects the directors and officers of Alliance (including
former directors and officers) would not be available for the 3 (three) years

Agreement. There have not been any Legal Proceedings asserted against
Alliance with respect to any directors\' or officers\' indemnification
agreement referred to in Section 5.8. Alliance has not taken any action, and
