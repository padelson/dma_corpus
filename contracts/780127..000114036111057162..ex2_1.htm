AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

  


 

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 12, 2011 (this
"Agreement"), is made by and among Baxter International Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Twins Merger Sub, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Synovis Life
Technologies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").

  

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
$.01 par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") not owned directly or
indirectly by Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company, except shares of
Company Common Stock held by holders who comply with the provisions of the
Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA") regarding the right of
shareholders to dissent from the Merger, will be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined);

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has determined that the
Merger is advisable and in the best interest of the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the plan of merger (as such
term is used in Section 302A.611 of the MBCA) contained in this Agreement (the
"Plan of Merger") and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and (iii) is recommending that the Company's
shareholders approve the Merger and adopt the Plan of Merger, as applicable;
and

  

  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent is entering into a voting agreement with the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company and certain officers of the
Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a
"Voting Agreement").

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined).
Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the MBCA.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective when the
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger"), executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the MBCA, are filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Minnesota; provided, however, that, upon the mutual consent of Merger
Sub and the Company, the Articles of Merger may provide for a later date or
time of effectiveness of the Merger. The filing of the Articles of Merger
shall be made on the date of the Closing (as hereinafter defined).

  

  

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA.

  

  

Section 1.4 Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended,
of the Company shall be amended as set forth in Exhibit B and, as so amended,
shall be the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein by the
MBCA or any other applicable foreign, federal, state, local or municipal laws,
statutes, ordinances, regulations and rules of any Governmental Entity,
including all Orders ("Laws"). At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or in the Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) The directors and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 1.5 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

  

  

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $.01 par value, of
Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Shares") that are held by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any Company Shares owned by Parent
or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.9, each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting
Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 1.5(b), shall be converted into the right to receive $28.00 in cash
without interest (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). At the Effective
Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive any Per Share Merger Consideration upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.6.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-2-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held
of record by shareholders who shall not have approved the Merger and who shall
have properly exercised dissenters' rights in accordance with Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 1.5(c), but the holders thereof instead shall be entitled to, and the
Dissenting Shares shall only represent the right to receive, payment of the
fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473
of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA; provided, however, that (i) if
such a holder fails to properly exercise dissenters' rights with respect to
his, her or its shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
the MBCA or, after making a demand for dissenters' rights, subsequently
delivers an effective written withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish
his or its entitlement to dissenters' rights as provided in Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his, her or its
Dissenting Shares or such holder shall otherwise lose his, her or its
dissenters' rights, then, in any such case, each share of Company Common Stock
held of record by such holder or holders shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
set forth in Section 1.5(c), upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent and Merger
Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Section
302A.473 of the MBCA, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,
except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for fair value for Dissenting Shares or offer to settle, settle or negotiate
in respect of any such demands.

  

  

(e) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall immediately and fully vest. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below in this Section 1.5(e), each such Company Stock
Option shall terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time and each holder
of a Company Stock Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and
Parent shall cause the Company to pay as soon as practicable (and in any event
within five Business Days) following the Effective Time, in settlement of each
Option a single lump sum cash payment equal to the net amount of (i) the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B)
the number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option, less (ii) any
income or employment Tax required to be withheld under any applicable state,
local, or foreign Tax Laws or any other applicable Law. If the exercise price
per share of any Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero and, for the avoidance
of doubt, such Company Stock Options shall terminate and be canceled at the
Effective Time.

  

  

Section 1.6 Exchange of Shares. Parent shall authorize a reputable bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange with
outstanding Company Shares all cash payable pursuant to Section 1.5(c) (such
cash deposit being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of
the holders of Company Shares and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments
provided for in the agreement with the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided,
however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.5(c) as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 1.5(c) out of the Exchange Fund.
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days
following the Effective Time), to mail to each record holder of Company
Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(c), a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Company Shares shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Company Shares to the Exchange Agent, and shall contain instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such Company Shares in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration (the "Transmittal Letter")). Upon surrender for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent of its, his or her Company Shares, together
with the Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed, the holder
of such Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.5(c), and any Company Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid
to any person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Company Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment thereof
that the surrendered Company Share be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such Company Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.6, each Company
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon such surrender.
Except for interest required to be paid in respect of Dissenting Shares
pursuant to the MBCA, no interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
Article I.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 1.7 Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any payments made in
respect of the Dissenting Shares) to any Person such amounts as Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise would have
received the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 1.8 Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent,
and any such former shareholders who have not theretofore complied with this
Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Per Share Merger Consideration. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common
Stock for any such Per Share Merger Consideration which is delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

statements and other documents required to be filed by it since October 31,
2008 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (such documents, together
with any documents filed during such period by the Company with the SEC on a
voluntary basis, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing
dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last amendment prior to the date
of this Agreement, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, "SOX"), and, at the respective times they
were filed, none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent
that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised,
amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-filed Company SEC Document,
none of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, which individually
or in the aggregate would require an amendment, supplement or corrective
filing to any such Company SEC Document. The consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any notes thereto) of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments). Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not, since October
31, 2010, made or adopted any material change in its accounting methods,
practices or policies in effect on October 31, 2010.

written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since October 31,
2010, relating to the Company SEC Documents and all written responses of the
Company thereto other than with respect to requests for confidential
treatment. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any Company SEC Documents and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents (other than
confidential treatment requests) is the subject of ongoing SEC review. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other
governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company.

  

  

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of SOX. The Company's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on the Company's
management's most recently completed evaluation of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) to
the Knowledge of the Company, the Company had no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or similar Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company's or such Subsidiary's published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

  

  

(f) Since October 31, 2008, the Company has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness" in
the Company's internal control over financial reporting. There is no
outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which the
Company's independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings

Section 3.14 ERISA.

respect to each Company Plan, to the extent applicable, the Company has
delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of (i) the three (3) most recent
annual reports (Forms 5500) filed with the IRS; (ii) each such Company Plan
that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto; (iii) each trust,
insurance and administrative Contract relating to each such Company Plan; (iv)
a written summary of each unwritten Company Plan; (v) the most recent summary
plan description or other written explanation of each Company Plan provided to
participants; (vi) the most recent determination or opinion letter issued by
the IRS with respect to any Company Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code; (vii) any request for a determination currently
pending before the IRS; and (viii) all correspondence with the IRS, the
Department of Labor, the SEC or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating
to any outstanding inquiry, controversy or audit. Each Company Plan has been
funded, administered and maintained, in form and operation, in all material
respects with its terms, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA"), the Code and all other applicable statutes and governmental rules
and regulations, and the plan sponsor of each Company Plan is in compliance
with all filing and disclosure requirements imposed on it with respect to such
Company Plans. Neither the Company nor any current or former ERISA Affiliate
has sponsored, has contributed to, has or had an obligation to contribute to,
or has any liability with respect to (x) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
including any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), a
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), or a multiple
employer plan subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, (y) a multiple
employer welfare benefit arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA)
or (z) a plan subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability of any kind
whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, contingent or otherwise, (i) on account
of any violation of the health care requirements of Part 6 or 7 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code, (ii) under Section
502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) under Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (iv) under Title IV of ERISA. No
fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Company Plan
subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has committed a breach of
fiduciary duty with respect to that Company Plan that could subject such
fiduciary, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to any
material liability. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened action, claim or lawsuit relating to any Company Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) that could result in a material liability. There
is no audit, inquiry or examination pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental body with respect to any
Company Plan. All Company Plans that are intended by their terms to be, or are
otherwise treated by the Company as, qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, are entitled to rely
on a prototype opinion letter issued by the IRS, or a timely application for
such determination is now pending and no circumstances exist (x) which could
result in loss of such qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code or (ii)
which could result in a material penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement
Program if discovered during an IRS audit or investigation. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation under any
Company Plan or otherwise to provide benefits after termination of employment
to any person other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
applicable state Law. All contributions, premiums or other payments that are
due have been paid on a timely basis with respect to each Company Plan

(c) Except to the extent set forth in Sections 5.4 and any required
distribution from the Company's 401(k) Plan as a result of the termination of
the Company's 401(k) Plan in accordance with Section 5.11, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with another
event) will or is reasonably expected to (i) entitle any current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company to any payment
(including severance pay or similar compensation), any cancellation of
indebtedness, or any increase in compensation, (ii) result in the acceleration
of payment, funding or vesting under any Company Plan or (iii) result in any
forfeiture of or increase in benefits payable under any Company Plan.

  

  

(d) Each Company Plan which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
within the meaning of, and subject to, Section 409A of the Code has been at
all times administered, operated and maintained in all respects in accordance
with its terms and according to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code,
except for any failure that would not result in a material liability to the
Company. No person is entitled to receive any additional payment from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of a Tax
under Section 409A of the Code and no person is entitled to receive any
additional payment as a result of the imposition of a Tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

  

  

(e) With respect to each Company Plan not subject to United States Law (a
"Company Foreign Benefit Plan"), (i) the fair market value of the assets of
each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the reserve shown
on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents for any unfunded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
projected benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan based on reasonable, country
specific actuarial assumptions and valuations and no transaction contemplated

respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign Laws, rules and

the protection and clean-up of the environment and activities or conditions
related thereto, including those relating to the generation, handling,
disposal, transportation or release of hazardous materials (collectively,

distribution of its products as a result of any existing or pending (but not
yet final) requirement of Environmental Law, and such products are not subject

recycling. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or
assumed, by Contract or operation of Law or otherwise, any material
obligation, liability, order, settlement, judgment, injunction or decree

Company there are no facts, circumstances or conditions, and there has been no
exposure to Hazardous Materials, that would reasonably be expected to form the
basis for any material investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or
liability against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to or arising under Environmental Laws. The term "Hazardous Materials" means
any chemical, material, substance, waste, pollutant or contaminant that is

administrative or judicial complaint, action or investigation pending or

National Labor Relations Board, any state or federal agency, or any other
third party with respect to the Company Business Personnel, except where such
unfair labor practice, complaint, grievance or other administrative or
judicial complaint, action or investigation would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no labor strike,
dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
may interfere with the respective business activities of the Company or any of

Section 4.2 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director,
employee, agent, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, investment banker or
other advisor or representative ("Representatives") of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate, induce or encourage the making, announcement or
submission of, any Alternative Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal;
(ii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any Contract
contemplating, providing for, relating to or in connection with, any

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Alternative Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Alternative Proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Alternative Proposal or (v) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations (including furnishing any

the foregoing, it is agreed that (x) any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 4.2(a) by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective directors, officers, employees or Representatives and (y) any
violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 4.3 of the Voting Agreement

Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of the
directors, officers, employees and Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal. The Company will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of any Alternative Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this
Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform its directors, officers, employees and
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-34-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.2(a) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that the Company receives after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Proposal that did not
result from any breach of any of the provisions in this Section 4.2 and that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be a Superior Proposal or to be
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, in
response to such Alternative Proposal, subject to compliance with this Section
4.2 and receiving from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement may
contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction for any Person or any
of such Person's Affiliates not already subject to a confidentiality agreement
with the Company, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such
provision, as applicable), then (i) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Alternative Proposal; provided that, contemporaneously with furnishing any
such information to such Person, it furnishes such information to Parent and
(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to
such Alternative Proposal; provided that, at least one Business Day prior to
furnishing any such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person and of the Company's intention to furnish information
to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person. It is
understood that the Company may enter into negotiations solely with respect to
entering into a confidentiality agreement with a Person who has made an
unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Proposal that is or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal without breaching, or being deemed to
breach, this Section 4.2.

  

  

The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing information to Parent that
is required to be provided under this Section 4.2.

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
4.2(a), 4.2(b) and 4.2(d), as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
one Business Day) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or any inquiry that, in any such case, relates in any
way to, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal,
the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Alternative Proposal, request or
inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with
such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one
Business Day) with such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent
fully informed of all material written communications regarding, and the
status and changes to the economic or other material terms of, any such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and shall provide, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to Parent a copy of all material written
communications (including material written communications provided by email or
otherwise in electronic format) provided by or to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives in connection with such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent
with forty eight (48) hours prior written notice, or if such meeting is
scheduled on less than 48 hours notice then as promptly as practicable prior
to such meeting, of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board
of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Alternative Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-35-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make any
public statement in connection with such recommendations by the Company's
Board of Directors or Company Shareholder Meeting or in reference to an
Alternative Proposal, that is inconsistent with the recommendation of the
Company's Board of Directors to the Company's shareholders to approve the
Merger and adopt the Plan of Merger, (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or
publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Proposal or
(C) (1) fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation of the Company's Board of
Directors to the Company's shareholders to approve the Merger and adopt the
Plan of Merger, or fail to publicly state that the Merger and this Agreement
are in the best interest of the Company's shareholders, within five Business
Days after Parent requests in writing that such action be taken; (2) fail to
publicly announce, within five Business Days after a tender offer or exchange
offer relating to the securities of the Company and, in each case, which is an
Alternative Proposal, shall have been commenced, a statement disclosing that
the Company's Board of Directors recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer; or (3) fail to issue publicly, within five Business Days after
an Alternative Proposal is publicly announced, a press release announcing its
opposition to such Alternative Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding or any tender offer (A) constituting, or relating
to, any Alternative Proposal or (B) requiring it (or that would require it) to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 4.2(d) or in any other provision of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and (solely with
respect to clause (x) of this sentence) concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if either (x)
such action is taken in response to a Superior Proposal that was made after
the date of this Agreement and that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 4.2 or (y) in the absence of a Superior Proposal, there are
material events or changes in circumstances after the date hereof that were
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company as of or prior to
the date hereof, that materially improve the financial condition, results of
operations or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and that do not
relate to (1) an Alternative Proposal, (2) any events or changes in
circumstances relating to Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective
Affiliates), (3) clearance of the Merger under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws or (4) the fact, in each case in and of itself, that the
Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or
estimates of its revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results
of operations for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes
after the date of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock or any credit rating of the Company (provided that the
events or changes giving rise to or contributing to such material improvement
or improvements may be taken into account in making the determination under
this clause (y)) (an "Intervening Event"); provided that all of the following
conditions in clauses (i) through (vi) are met, as applicable:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-36-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) in the case of a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination in
response to a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal has been made and has
not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

  

  

(ii) the Company Shareholder Approval has not been obtained;

  

  

(iii) the Company has (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a Superior
Proposal or that there has been an Intervening Event, (2) the material terms
and conditions of any Superior Proposal (including the per share value of the
consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making the Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and other material
documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal (the "Alternative Transaction Agreement") (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new four (4) Business
Day period), (3) the material details of any Intervening Event (including
specifying the estimated dollar value or range of estimated dollar values
attributed to such Intervening Event) and (4) that it intends to terminate
this Agreement, and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) prior to
terminating this Agreement, to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that,
in the case of a Superior Proposal, the transaction contemplated by the
Alternative Transaction Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or,
in the case of an Intervening Event, that causes the Company's Board of
Directors not to adopt a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-37-  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iv) the Company shall have complied with this Section 4.2;

  

  

(v) the Company pays all fees and expenses as required pursuant to Section
7.3; and

  

  

(vi) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the Superior
Proposal or Intervening Event, a failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company's Board of Directors to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.2(a) or 4.2(d),
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or publicly disclosing the existence of
an Alternative Proposal to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that
the failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 4.2(d) (it being understood that any accurate
disclosure of factual information required to be made under applicable Law
shall not be considered a modification prohibited by Section 4.2(d) and that
the issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication under Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act would not violate Section 4.2(d)).

  

  

Section 4.3 Third Party Standstill Agreements. During the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive, or permit the release of any Person from, any
provision of any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or
similar Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be
enforced at the request of Parent, including obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of, and to enforce specifically, such agreements.

  

  

ARTICLE V

  

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 5.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent and the Company will as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement jointly prepare the
Proxy Statement, and the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC,
and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments
of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company
Shareholders at the earliest practical time. The Company shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with such actions, and Parent shall furnish
all information concerning it and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably
request in connection with such actions. Each party to this Agreement will
notify the other parties promptly of the receipt of the comments of the SEC,
if any, and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto, and will
supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between such party
or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (a) shall
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (b) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent; provided that Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided its comments to the
Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after such document or response
is transmitted to Parent for its review. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

Section 5.2 Company Shareholder Meeting.

  

  

(a) The Company will, as soon as practicable following the date on which the
SEC's comments to the Proxy Statement, if any, are resolved, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of the
Company's shareholders duly approving the Merger and adopting the Plan of
Merger (the "Company Shareholder Approval") and to vote, on an advisory basis,
on a proposal to approve the compensation that may be payable to the Company's
named executive officers in connection with the Merger (a "say-on-golden
parachute compensation" vote) as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act
and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, and shall not submit any other
proposals to such holders without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, and
convene the Company Shareholder Meeting. Subject to Section 4.2(d), the
Company shall (i) solicit from the Company's shareholders entitled to vote at
the Company Shareholder Meeting proxies in favor of such approval and (ii)
take all other action reasonably necessary to secure the vote or consent of
such holders required by the MBCA or this Agreement to effect the Merger. The
Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives in connection with the Company
Shareholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws.

  

  

(b) The Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
shareholders approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of Merger, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit such approvals and adoption by
its shareholders and such Board of Directors or committee thereof shall not,
directly or indirectly, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent such recommendation or its declaration that this
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interest of
the Company and its shareholders or resolve or propose to do any of the
foregoing, except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 4.2(d). The
Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company, subject to any modification, amendment or withdrawal thereof, and
the Company represents that Piper Jaffray and Co. has, subject to the terms of
its engagement letter with the Company and the Board of Directors of the
Company, consented to the inclusion of references to its opinion in the Proxy
Statement.

Section 5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall afford
to Parent, and to Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all
its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts and records but only to
the extent that such access is not prohibited by applicable Law and does not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to
Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws, other than any such report,
schedule, registration statement or other document that is available in
unredacted form on EDGAR, (b) a copy of each correspondence or written
communication, other than immaterial correspondence and written communication,
with any United States Federal or state Governmental Entity and (c) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such copies or other information to the extent
that doing so would result in a violation of applicable Law or the loss of
attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a violation of applicable Law or loss of attorney-client privilege).
Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold,
all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and shall
otherwise comply with the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such
information; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at
the Effective Time. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 or
information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

the ESPP (i) participation following the date of this Agreement shall be
limited to those employees who participate on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP as an
"employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase their
payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of
this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of
this Agreement, (iv) each participant's outstanding right to purchase Company
Shares under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day

from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price
determined under the terms of the ESPP for the then outstanding offering
periods using such date as the final purchase date for each such offering
period, and (v) assuming the occurrence of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall
terminate immediately following such purchases of Company Shares.

  

  

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b) shall be

interest as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a
Company Stock Option or other stock-based award (or former holder of a Company
Stock Option or other stock-based award) or any current or former participant
in any Company Stock Plan or Company Plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries or any other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights or stock based performance

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement), each of Parent and the
Company shall file any Notification and Report Forms and related material
required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act with

make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or
advisable (the "HSR Filings") and in any other jurisdictions in which a
competition filing may be required.

  

  

(b) Upon and subject to the terms of this Section 5.6, Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to (i) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prompt termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws; (ii) cooperate and consult
with each other in connection with the making of all HSR Filings and any other
material actions pursuant to this Section 5.6, including subject to applicable
Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written communication to any Antitrust Authority and by providing
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by
such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with
any Antitrust Authority and any other information supplied by such party and
such party's Subsidiaries to an Antitrust Authority or received from an
Antitrust Authority in connection with such HSR Filings or any applicable
Antitrust Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that materials may be redacted before being
provided to the other party (A) to remove references concerning the valuation
of Parent, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns or reasonable confidentiality concerns that

contained in Section 5.6(a) and this Section 5.6(b), each party agrees to
cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist in any defense
by any other party hereto of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
before any Antitrust Authority reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by providing (as promptly as practicable) such
information as may be requested by such Antitrust Authority or such assistance
as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto in such defense.

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Antitrust Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any Action is instituted by any
Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any applicable Antitrust Law or an Order is issued enjoining the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case under any applicable
Antitrust Law, Parent shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 5.6,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or
challenge as such Antitrust Authority may have to such transactions under such
Law or to have such Order vacated, reversed or otherwise removed in accordance
with applicable legal procedures with the goal of enabling the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Outside Date (as
hereinafter defined), and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Parent in effectuating the foregoing; provided, however,
that (i) the Company shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the
prior written consent of Parent, (ii) Parent shall not take any of the
foregoing actions without the prior written consent of the Company if such
actions would bind the Company to take any action (including paying money or
entering into any other obligation) and (iii) that such action shall be
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not be obligated to agree (and failure to so agree shall not
constitute a failure by Parent to satisfy its "commercially reasonable
efforts" obligations as provided in this Section 5.6), and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary shall agree without Parent's prior written consent, to take
any action or accept any condition, restriction, obligation or requirement
with respect to Parent, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries or their
and their respective Subsidiaries' assets if such action, condition,
restriction, obligation or requirement (i) would reasonably be expected to
require Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to sell, license,
transfer, assign, lease, dispose of or hold separate any business or assets,
(ii) would reasonably be expected to result in any limitations on Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries to own, retain, conduct or operate
all or a material portion of their respective businesses or assets or (iii)
would reasonably be expected to require Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to grant any material right or commercial or other
accommodation to, or enter into any commercial contractual or other commercial
relationship with, any third party, if the actions referred to in the
foregoing (i) - (iii), individually or in the aggregate, would be material to
the business or financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

  

Section 5.7 Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press
release(s) to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form(s) heretofore agreed to by the parties. Except
with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent at all reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before making, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such reasonably
practicable consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system.

Section 5.8 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
shall become, or purport to become, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of
Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.9 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and until such
later date as of which any Action commenced during such six (6) year period
shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations (including both indemnification and advancement of
expenses) of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the articles of
incorporation or any bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
indemnification agreements, in each case, in effect immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement and disclosed to Parent for the benefit of any of its
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time (the "Indemnified Parties").

  

  

(b) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective
Time, the Company's current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially similar (with
respect to limits and deductibles) to the Company's existing policy or, if
substantially similar insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Company's Current Premium"). If such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 250% of the Company's Current Premium, then Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
Parent's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 250% of the Company's Current Premium. The Company
represents to Parent that the Company's Current Premium is $115,000.

  

  

Section 5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to cause (x) any
representation or warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any covenant,
condition or agreement of the notifying party contained in this Agreement not
to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any failure of
the notifying party to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or
(iii) any change, event or effect which would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or,
unless the impairment or delay constituting such Parent Material Adverse
Effect results from any failure of the conditions set forth in Article VI to
be satisfied, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, on the
notifying party; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.11 Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan covering employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to recognize prior, continuous service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries as service with Parent
and its Subsidiaries (i) for purposes of any waiting period and eligibility
requirements (and for purposes of determining the amount of severance payable
under any severance plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries) under any Parent Plan that is a "welfare plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) (to the extent permitted under the terms of the
insurance policy of any insured benefit plans) and (ii) for purposes of
eligibility (including eligibility for early retirement benefits) and vesting
(but not benefit accrual) under any Parent Plan that is a "pension plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), to the extent such service was recognized
for such purposes under the applicable Company Plan. In addition, subject to
approval by Parent's benefit plan administrative committee, for each Parent
Plan that is a "welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA that Parent
makes available to such employees in lieu of a similar Company Plan), Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and covered
dependents of such employees during the portion of the plan year of the
applicable Company Plan in which such employees participated immediately
before the Effective time, ending on the date such employees' participation in
the corresponding Parent Plan begins, to be taken into account under such
Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employees and their covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Parent Plan (to the extent permitted under the terms of
the insurance policy of any insured benefit plans). Prior to the Effective
Time (but not earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time), the Company shall (unless otherwise instructed by the Buyer prior to
the taking of such actions) take all such actions as are necessary, including
without limitation, adoption of board resolutions or consents dated no later
than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, to terminate the
Company's 401(k) Plan, effective no later than the day immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Parent's, the Company's or any of
their Subsidiaries' ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) is intended to confer upon any
current or former employee any right to employment or continued employment for
any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment or (iv) is intended to confer upon any
individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of
employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

make a request to any Governmental Entity to change) any of its methods of

claim for a material refund of Taxes, (vi) consent to any extension or waiver
of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax claim or assessment
that could adversely affect Parent's Tax liability, (vii) make any change in
any financial or Tax accounting principle, method or practice, other than as
required by GAAP, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
applicable Law or as recommended by the Company's independent auditor or
(viii) settle or compromise any suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding
or audit pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any material amount of Tax or enter into any
material closing agreement that could adversely affect Parent's Tax liability
for any taxable period beginning on or after the Effective Time.

and records reasonably necessary for the preparation of Tax Returns.

orally and in writing of any Action commenced after the date of this Agreement
against the Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of the Company
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and shall
consider Parent's views with respect to such Action and shall not settle any
such Action without the prior written consent of Parent.

which shall survive the termination); provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party hereto from any

termination of documentation supporting such Expenses. If, concurrently with
or within twelve (12) months after any such termination described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company enters into a definitive agreement

have been exhausted or the order is no longer appealable. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought, any objection which it may have or hereafter have as to personal
jurisdiction, the laying of the venue of any such action or proceeding brought
in any such court and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees

5.7 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Minnesota or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota.

  

  

(b) Exclusive Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Delaware,
in any action or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement,
irrevocably consents to the service of process by registered mail or personal
service and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court, and agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement in any other
court unless and until the foregoing court renders a final order that it
lacks, and cannot acquire, the necessary jurisdiction, and either all appeals
have been exhausted or the order is no longer appealable. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought, any objection which it may have or hereafter have as to personal
jurisdiction, the laying of the venue of any such action or proceeding brought
in any such court and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law or at equity.

(c) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 5.7.

  

  

5.8 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Shareholder. Each party may
waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by
such party and delivered to the other party.

  

  

5.9 Remedies. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the other party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court in the
United States or in any state having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled pursuant
hereto.

  

  

5.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

  

  

5.11 Successors and Assign. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void, except that Parent, upon prior written notice to the
Shareholder, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent but no such assignment shall relieve Parent
of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
