NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:     

 **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

1.1 _The Merger; Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). As
soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ "), a certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware.  The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_
").

  

1.2 _Closing_. The Closing shall take place at 9:30 a.m., Houston, Texas
time, on a date that is two Business Days following the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver in accordance with this
Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than (i)
any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) waived in accordance with this Agreement on the
Closing Date, (ii) the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ , (iii)
_Section 6.3(c)_ and (iv) _Section 6.3(d)_ ) (such date being, the " _First
Eligible Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in
Houston, Texas, or such other place as Parent and the Company may agree in
writing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the option of the Parent (the "
_Parent Closing Option_ ") the Closing may take place on a date that is the
earlier of (a) a Business Day on or after the First Eligible Closing Date
during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no less than five
Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the
Marketing Period. The " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date on which the
Closing occurs.  " _Business Day_ " shall mean a day other than a day on
which banks in the State of New York or the State of Delaware are authorized
or obligated to be closed. " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first
period of 20 consecutive Business Days after the Initiation Date throughout
which (A) Merger Sub shall have had the Section 5.13(c) Financial
Information, (B) the Section 5.13(c) Financial Information that is applicable
to the first day of the Marketing Period is as of and for the same periods as
such information applicable to the last day of the Marketing Period and (C)
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled on the final day of the Marketing Period;
_provided_ , that such period shall not include any period that includes any
of the periods from and including December 15, 2007 through and including
January 1, 2008, February 15, 2008 through and including March 23, 2008 or
August 16, 2008 through and including September 1, 2008; and _provided_  
_further_ , that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that
is the date on which the Debt Financing is consummated. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Initiation Date_ " shall mean the first Business Day following
the date on which the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_
have been satisfied (other than (i) conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied at the Closing or (ii) the condition set forth in _Section
6.2(d)_ ); _provided_ , that the Initiation Date shall not occur on any date
earlier than the date upon which the Company notifies Parent in writing that
all of the conditions to the Initiation Date have occurred (unless the Parent
provides the Company with a written waiver of such requirement to deliver
notice). If Parent elects to exercise the Parent Closing Option and the
Marketing Period

        

extends beyond September 28, 2008 (the " _Outside Date_ "), then from and
after the Outside Date, the conditions in _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section
6.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section 6.2(e)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied. If
the Closing is scheduled to occur on a date other than a Business Day, then
the Closing shall occur on the immediately following Business Day.

  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the
Company is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time
and subject to _Section 5.6(b)_ , (a) the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its entirety in the
form of Exhibit A hereto, and, as so amended, such Certificate of
Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and
applicable law; and (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms
and applicable law.

  

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 **ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER
SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or
the holder of any of their securities:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and shall represent one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Surviving Corporations common stock.

  

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_, each share of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in clause (ii) of
this _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares), including for the avoidance
of doubt any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (x) that were issued upon the conversion of the 5%
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the " _5% Preferred
Stock_ ") or (y) whose

        

prior restrictions have lapsed pursuant to _Section 2.4_, shall be converted
into the right to receive $28.00 in cash, without interest. ** **In the event
that the Effective Time shall not have occurred by April 5, 2008 (the "
_Adjustment Date_ "), the $28.00 per share of Company Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be increased for each day after the
Adjustment Date, through and including the Closing Date, by adding thereto
the excess (which shall not be less than zero) of (i) an amount equal to
$0.006137 per day over (ii) any dividends or distributions (valued at the
Closing Date using 8% simple interest per annum from the applicable date of
payment) declared, made or paid (without duplication) on a share of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock from and after the Adjustment Date
through and including the Closing Date (the amount per share of Company
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ (rounding to the
nearest cent) is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_.") All such
shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each
holder of a certificate previously representing any such converted shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

(ii) Subject to _Section 5.14_ , all shares of 5% Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any such
shares described in clause (iii) of this _Section 2.1(b)_) shall remain
outstanding and be entitled to the rights and privileges set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance
with _Section 2.5_.

  

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock or 5% Preferred Stock held by the
Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any Subsidiary of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

  

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in the number
of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Stock Options), issued and outstanding between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of
Company Common Stock (or Option Consideration to be paid for any Company
Stock Option, as the case may be) as provided in this Agreement shall be
equitably adjusted to effect such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or the Option
Consideration, as the case may be, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this _Section 2.1(c)_.

  

2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder
(excluding any shares described in _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_) who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_, but instead
at the Effective Time the holders of Appraisal Shares shall

        

become entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Effective Time, all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist and the holder of such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except as set forth in this _Section 2.2_.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited
and cease, and each of such holders Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right
to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and provide
Parent with the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.  Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. The Company agrees that it will take
such actions as are necessary to cause at the Effective Time each option for
the purchase of Company Common Stock then outstanding (" _Company Stock
Option_ "), whether or not exercisable, under the Companys Stock Incentive
Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), to become fully exercisable (if not then
fully exercisable), and such options shall thereafter be cancelled and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of Company Stock Options shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Stock Option except the
right to receive the following consideration upon delivery of an option
surrender agreement, which shall be in a form reasonably agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing (" _Option Surrender Agreement_ ") in
accordance with _Section 2.5(b)(i)(B)_: for each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (such amount in cash as
described above being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_
"). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the actions described in
the preceding sentence shall occur at the Effective Time without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective stockholders.

  

2.4 _Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of
restricted Company Common Stock (including restricted stock units and phantom
stock, except as set forth in _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter) issued or granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan shall
immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of such Company
Common Stock (including restricted stock units and phantom stock, except as
set forth in _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms hereof.

        

2.5 _Payment for Securities_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock and holders of the Company Stock Options in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. On the Closing Date and prior to
the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options, for payment in accordance
with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and the aggregate Option Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and the Option Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_, in each case, out of the Payment Fund.
The Payment Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United
States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall be
solely for the account of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options
shall be entitled under _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_ , respectively,
Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving
Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent
sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in
connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration and the
surrender of Company Stock Options for the Option Consideration.

  

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to deliver:

  

(A) to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
of (1) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (2) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a customary letter of transmittal (" _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the

        

Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
2.1(b)(i)_; and

  

(B) to each holder of a Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time (1)
an Option Surrender Agreement, and (2) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Company Stock Option in exchange for the
Option Consideration.

  

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then
be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to an individual, partnership, limited
liability company, corporation, joint stock company, trust, estate, joint
venture, Governmental Entity, association or unincorporated organization, or
any other form of business or professional entity (" _Person_ "), other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share shall, subject to _Section 2.2_, be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_.

  

(iii) Upon surrender of a Company Stock Option for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with the Option Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, the holder of the Company Stock Option shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.3_, and the
Company Stock Option so surrendered shall then be canceled. Until surrendered
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.5(b)(iii)_, each
Company Stock Option shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Option Consideration
as contemplated by this _Article II_.

  

(c) _Termination of Rights_.

  

(i) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common

        

Stock. After the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than certificates
evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
as provided in this _Article II_.

  

(ii) The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had
or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including
causing the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committees thereof) to
take such actions as are allowed by the Company Stock Plans) to ensure that,
following the Effective Time, without any action required by any holder of
Company Options, (A) no participant in the Company Stock Plans or any other
plans, programs or arrangements of the Company shall have any right
thereunder to acquire or otherwise receive any capital stock of, or other
equity or similar interests in, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, an "
_Affiliate_ ") thereof and (B) the Company Stock Options may be surrendered
in exchange for the Option Consideration pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest thereon) that remains undistributed to the former
common stockholders or optionholders of the Company on the 365th day after
the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former common stockholders
or optionholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the
Merger Consideration or Option Consideration to which they are entitled under
this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Option for any amount of Merger Consideration or Option
Consideration, as applicable, delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate,
Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option has not been surrendered prior to
the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration
or Option Consideration in respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share or
Company Stock Option would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_.  If any Certificate (other
than a Certificate evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section
2.1(b)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving

        

Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_.

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options pursuant to this
Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts
are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as applicable, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

 **ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

  

3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth
on the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered
by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed in
the SEC Documents (and then only to the extent reasonably apparent in the SEC
Documents that such disclosed item is an event, item or occurrence that
constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in this
_Section 3.1_ ), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate,
partnership or limited liability company power and authority to own, lease

conducted, and each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it
is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties,
makes such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly
organized, validly existing, or so to qualify or be in good standing would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) or a material and adverse effect
on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the Merger. The Company has heretofore made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and
its Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") as well as
the similar organizational documents of each Significant Subsidiary, in each
case as of the date hereof. The respective jurisdictions of incorporation or
organization of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company are identified on

this Agreement: (i) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " means Huntsman

        

International LLC, Huntsman Advanced Materials LLC and Huntsman Petrochemical
Corporation; (ii) a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
occurrence, condition, change, event or effect that is materially adverse to
the financial condition, business, or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no
event shall any of the following constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect:  (A) any occurrence, condition, change, event or effect
resulting from or relating to changes in general economic or financial market
conditions, except in the event, and only to the extent, that such
occurrence, condition, change, event or effect has had a disproportionate
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other Persons engaged in the chemical industry; (B) any occurrence,

of each Person set forth in _Schedule 3.1(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter made at any time between January 1, 2005 and the date hereof (the "

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  

(d) _SEC Documents_.

  

(i) The Company has made available to Parent (including, for purposes of
compliance with this representation, pursuant to the SECs "EDGAR" system) a
true and complete copy of each report, statement, schedule, prospectus,
registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by the Company
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since February
15, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ " and, together with the Subsidiary SEC Documents, the " _SEC
Documents_ "), which are all the documents (other than preliminary material)
that the Company was required to file with the SEC since February 15, 2005
and prior to the date of this Agreement. As of their respective dates, each of
the Company SEC Documents, as amended, complied as to form in all material

and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained, when
filed or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
such amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

  

(ii) The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents, including all notes and schedules thereto, complied in all
material respects, when filed or if amended prior to the date of this

accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted
by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) and fairly present in
all material respects in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP
(subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit

its most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee

affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report its consolidated financial information and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and
maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosures
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material

known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.

connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement in the form mailed
to stockholders will comply as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to
statements made therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is bound or
(iii) any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses (i) (with respect to the

failure so to hold would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except

by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _knowledge_ ," of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, means the actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of the
executive officers of the Company or Parent (including in the case of Parent,
partners, officers, associates and other employees of any controlling
stockholder of Parent who have worked on this Agreement and the
Transactions), as applicable, and any other officer of the Company or Parent,
as applicable, having primary responsibility for the matter in question.

  

(j) _Litigation_. There are no suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such suits, actions or proceedings that (i) do
not involve, in any individual case, a claim for monetary damages in excess
of $25,000,000, (ii) would not materially prohibit or restrict the Company
and its Subsidiaries from operating their business as they have historically,
or (iii) would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no (A) suit, action
or proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) judgment,
decree, injunction, ruling or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
either case that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material and adverse effect on the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the Merger. To the
knowledge of the Company, no officer or director of the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company is a defendant in any material suit,
claim, action, proceeding, arbitration or mediation in connection with his or

Company.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of

Material Adverse Effect.

(u) _Certain Contracts and Arrangements_. _Schedule 3.1(u)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, together with the lists of exhibits contained in
the Company SEC Documents, sets forth a true and complete list, as of the
date of this Agreement, of: (i) each agreement to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (other than this Agreement) that is of a type
that would be required to be included as an exhibit to a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 pursuant to Items 601(b)(2), (4), (9) or (10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC if such a registration statement was filed by the
Company on the date of this Agreement; (ii) any agreement that purports to

or agreement relating to the borrowing of money or extension of credit
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a borrowing
capacity of more than $15.0 million or outstanding indebtedness of more than
$15.0 million; (v) each agreement that contains obligations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries secured by a lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances), or
interest rate or currency hedging agreements, in each case in connection with
which the aggregate actual or contingent obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under such contract are greater than $15.0 million; (vi) any

interests of another Person for aggregate consideration under such contract
in excess of $5.0 million, but excluding for purposes of this clause (vi) any
supply or sales contracts; (vii) any contract pursuant to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is burdened from continuing indemnification, "earn

million in any one year (collectively, the " _Company Contracts_ "). Except as

federal laws in the United States (with the exception of Section 203 of the
DGCL (" _Section 203_")) applicable to the Company is applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. Assuming
the accuracy of the representations made in _Section 3.2(h)_, the action of
the Board of Directors of the Company in approving this Agreement
is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, and the
Voting Agreements the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined
in Section 203) as set forth in Section 203.

Real Property, contains a correct location and description of the business
purpose of such Owned Real Property. _Schedule 3.1(w)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list, as of the date
of this Agreement, of all material real property leased, subleased, licensed
or otherwise occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to other
occupancy arrangements) by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
(collectively, including the improvements thereon, the " _Material Leased
Real Property_ "), and for each Material Leased Real Property, identifies the
location of such Material Leased Real Property. The Owned Real Property and
the Material Leased Real Property shall be referred to herein,
individually as " _Real Property_ " and, collectively, as the " _Real
Properties_ "). Except as would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and marketable title to all
Owned Real Property and valid leasehold estates in all Material Leased Real
Property free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances,
(ii) each agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
is the landlord, sub-landlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with respect to
the Material Leased Real Property (each, a " _Material Real Property Lease_
") to the knowledge of the Company is in full force and effect and is valid
and enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto, has received written notice of any default
under any Material Real Property Lease, and a true, correct and complete copy
of each Material Real Property Lease has been made available to Parent prior
to the date hereof, and (iii), as of the date of this Agreement, there does
not exist any pending or,

        

to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings that affect any of the Real Properties.

  

(x) _Related Party Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement or transaction with
(i) any direct or indirect beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Companys
Common Stock with respect to which the Company has knowledge or (ii) any
director, officer or other Affiliate of such persons or any relative of any
of the foregoing except for employment or compensation agreements or
arrangements with directors and officers and director and officer indemnity
agreements, in each case made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice.

  

3.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except as
set forth on the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (and then only to the extent reasonably
apparent in the Parent SEC Documents that such disclosed item is an event,
item or occurrence that constitutes a breach of a representation or warranty
set forth in this _Section 3.2_ ), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its state of incorporation, has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting,
or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such
qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly organized,
validly existing, or so to qualify or be in good standing would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Parent and Merger Sub each
has heretofore made available to the Company complete and correct copies of
its Certificate of Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation, as applicable,
and Bylaws, each as amended to date. " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any occurrence, condition, change, event or effect that prevents or
materially delays or impairs the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the Financing or pay the fees set forth in _Section
7.3(d)_.

  

(b) _Authority; No Violations, Consents and Approvals_.

  

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all agreements,
instruments and documents related to the Financing and to consummate the
Merger and the Financing. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Merger and the Financing have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub (other than the
adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which
shall occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement).
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and
Merger Sub, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each
of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as
to enforceability, to

        

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). Parent, as the owner of all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, will immediately after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement adopt this Agreement in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the Financing will not result in any violation
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
acceleration of any material obligation or the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any provision
of (A) the Certificate of Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation, as
applicable, or Bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub or any provision of the
comparable charter or organizational documents of any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective properties
or assets are bound or (C) assuming the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, filings, or permits referred to in
_Section 3.2(b)(iii)_ are duly and timely obtained or made, any judgment,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B)
and (C), any such violations, defaults, acceleration, losses or Encumbrances
that would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, or
filing with, or permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the Financing, except
for: (A) the filing of a premerger notification report by Parent under the
HSR Act and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
with respect thereto; (B) the filing with the SEC of such reports
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and such other compliance with
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder as may be required
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; (C) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware; (D) such filings and approvals as may be required by any
foreign premerger notification or competition, securities, corporate or other

3.2(b)(iii)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter; and (E) any such consent,
approval, order, authorization, registration, filing, or permit that the
failure to obtain or would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the meeting of such stockholders to be held in connection with
the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Proxy

        

Statement, insofar as it relates to the Parent or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or other information supplied by the Parent for inclusion therein,
in the form mailed to stockholders will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

  

(d) _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no suits,
claim, actions, proceedings, arbitrations or mediations pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub, other than any
such suits, claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations or mediations
that would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets is or are
subject to any judgments, orders or decrees, except for those judgments,
orders or decrees that would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(e) _Financing_. True, correct and complete copies of the debt commitment
letter dated the date of this Agreement from affiliates of each of Credit
Suisse and Deutsche Bank (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") providing for debt
financing as described therein (the " _Financing_ "), subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein are attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , which
Commitment Letter includes a commitment to fund any payment made by Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.3_. The Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The aggregate proceeds contemplated to
be provided by the Commitment Letters will be sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
(including in connection with the provisional conversion of the 5% Preferred
Stock into Company Common Stock prior to the Merger), the aggregate Option
Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives incurred in connection with the Transactions
(collectively, the " _Required Amounts_ "). The obligations of the financing
sources to fund the commitments under the Commitment Letter are not subject
to any conditions other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred
that (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would constitute a
breach or default under the Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger Sub.
Parent has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that are reasonably
likely to result in (i) any of the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter not being satisfied or (ii) the funding contemplated in the Commitment
Letter not being made available to Parent on a timely basis in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(f) _SEC Documents_.

  

(i) Parent has made available to the Company (including, for purposes of
compliance with this representation, pursuant to the SECs "EDGAR" system) a

_Parent SEC Documents_ "), which are all the documents (other than

        

preliminary material) that Parent was required to file with the SEC since
January 1, 2004 and prior to the date of this Agreement. As of their
respective dates, each of the Parent SEC Documents, as amended, complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents,
and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained, when filed or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment with
respect to those disclosures that are amended, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

(ii) The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents,
including all notes and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects,
when filed or if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date
of such amendment, with the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect

consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein.

  

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From December 31, 2006 through
the date of this Agreement, there has not been any event, change, effect or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, had or would
be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, other than: (i)

of December 31, 2006 (including the notes thereto) contained in Parents
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006; (ii)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to
December 31, 2006; (iii) liabilities for fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions; (iv) liabilities not required to be
presented on the face of an unaudited interim balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP; and (v) liabilities which would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(i) _No Default_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, permit, franchise or license to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) any judgment,
order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any

        

Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except,
in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), for defaults or violations which
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(j) _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, and approvals
of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure so
to hold would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the failure
so to comply would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The businesses of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are not currently being conducted, and at no time during the
past three years have been conducted, in violation of any law, ordinance or
regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for violations which would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no investigation
or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, other
than those the outcome of which would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(k) _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
aggregate value of the Surviving Corporations assets will exceed its total
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities) at a fair valuation and at fair saleable value; (ii) the
Surviving Corporation will have the ability to pay its total debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities) as they become due in the usual course of its business; and
(iii) the Surviving Corporation will not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital with which to conduct its business.

  

(l) _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement
or the Merger or the Financing.  The vote or consent of Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub (which has been obtained) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions.

  

(m) _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub "own"
(within the meaning of Section 203) or have, within the last three years,
"owned" any shares of Company Common Stock or 5% Preferred Stock.

this _Section 4.2_, and (y) prior to taking any such actions, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the transaction committee thereof determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and after consultation with its outside counsel,
the Board of Directors of the Company or the transaction committee thereof
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

  

(iii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
in response to a Competing Proposal, (A) recommend such Competing Proposal to
its stockholders or withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of
this Agreement and the Merger and (B) if the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the transaction committee thereof) so chooses, cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ but only if prior to
taking any such action described in clause (A) or (B), (x) the Board of
Directors of the Company (or the transaction committee thereof) determines in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Competing Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into

Parent in response to such Competing Proposal), and (y) the Company shall
have given notice to Parent that the Company has received such Superior
Proposal, attaching a copy of such Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy
is available, a description of such Superior Proposal), and specifying the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and informing Parent

have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the

after consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors, shall
have determined in good faith that the third partys Competing Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal with respect to Parents revised proposal; 
_provided_ , that each time material modifications to the financial terms of
a Competing Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal are made the
time period set forth in this clause (y) prior to which the Company may
change its recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for
48 hours after notification of such change to Parent and (C) in light of such
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to withdraw or
modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
Board of Directors or any transaction committee thereof shall be permitted,
at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, other than in connection with a Competing Proposal, (i) to
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in

       

favor of this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) if the Board of Directors of
the Company (or the transaction committee thereof) so chooses, cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and to the extent permitted
by _Section 7.1(d)_ but only if prior to taking any such action described in
clause (i) or (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company (or the transaction
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law and the Company has given 48 hours
advance notice to Parent that the Company intends to take such action.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, shall not be deemed to be a recommendation of such Competing
Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation
of the Companys Board of Directors or the transaction committee thereof in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall, to the extent practicable, provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review any such statement, if
such statement is to be made and released in a writing.

  

(e) The Company shall advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any
Competing Proposal or any request for non-public information or data relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by any Person that has made or
informs the Company that it is considering making a Competing Proposal or any
request for discussions or negotiations with the Company or a Representative
of the Company relating to a Competing Proposal or which is reasonably likely
to lead to a Competing Proposal (in each case within 48 hours thereof), and
the Company shall provide to Parent (within such 48 hour time frame) the
identity of each party that makes any such proposal or offer and a copy of
any such proposal or offer (or, where no such copy is available, a
description of any such proposal or offer). The Company shall (i)
keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status of any such
proposal or offer and (ii) provide Parent promptly, and in any event within
48 hours, with copies of all significant correspondence and other written
material sent or received in connection with any such offer or proposal.

  

(f) Any action pursuant to _Sections 4.2(b)_,  _(c)_ or _(d)_ shall not
constitute a breach of the Companys representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings: (i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any contract,
proposal, offer or indication of interest relating to any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than transactions with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) involving:  (A) any merger, amalgamation, share exchange,
recapitalization, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company,
(B) any direct or indirect acquisition (by asset purchase, stock purchase,
merger, or otherwise) by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of any business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including capital stock of or ownership interest in
any Subsidiary) that generated 25% or more of the Companys consolidated
net revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for the preceding twelve months, or any license, lease or long-term
supply agreement having a similar economic effect, or (C) any direct

       

or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) by any Person or "group" of 25% or more of the
voting stock of the Company or any tender or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 25% or
more of the voting stock of the Company, (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means
any written proposal by any Person or "group" (other than Parent or any of
its Affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly, (x) businesses or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including capital stock of or
ownership interest in any Subsidiary) that generated 50% or more of the
Companys consolidated net revenue or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization for the preceding twelve months, respectively,
or (y) more than 50% of the Companys voting capital stock, in each case
whether by way of merger, amalgamation, share exchange, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise,
that in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company
or the transaction committee thereof, after consultation with its financial
advisors and after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory,
estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and the
Person or group making such proposal, (A) would, if consummated in accordance
with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of the Merger or this Agreement) and (B) is reasonably likely
to be consummated and (iii) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") means
a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains confidentiality and
standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(h) Except to facilitate the making of a Superior Proposal which facilitation
is otherwise in compliance with this _Section 4.2_ , the Company shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, terminate, amend, modify or
waive, and shall seek to enforce to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any provision of any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) unless the Companys Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
compliance with the terms of this _Section 4.2(h)_ would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

  

 **ARTICLE V 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

5.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement
(including the preliminary Proxy Statement) and any amendment or supplement
to the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement (and in any event no later
than 30 days following the date of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent
and give Parent and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
such preliminary Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any
comments of the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and
of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Parent,

       

as promptly as reasonably practicable, copies of all written correspondence
between the Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. If comments are received from the SEC staff
with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the comments of the SEC. The Company
shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
review any amendment or supplement to each of the preliminary and the
definitive Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection
therewith. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with such information as
may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably
required to respond to any comment of the SEC staff. After all the comments
received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all information
required to be contained in the Proxy Statement has been included therein by
the Company, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the
SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed (including by electronic
delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably practicable, to its
stockholders of record, as of the record date established by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

  

5.2 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, agents, legal counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ "),
during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.1_ of this
Agreement, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior
notice, to the officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records,
contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, furnish reasonably promptly to the Parent and its Representatives such
information concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries business,
properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested,
from time to time, by or on behalf of the Parent; _provided_ , that any such
access pursuant to this  _Section 5.2_ shall be coordinated through one of
the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.2_, the Company shall not be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to Parent or any of its Representatives to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege or that such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by law or an existing contract or agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to personnel records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the
Companys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability.  Parent agrees that
it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement dated as
of June 1, 2007 **** between an Affiliate of Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and, subject to _Section 7.2_, shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder.

       



  

5.3 _Stockholders  Meeting and Board Recommendation_. The Company
shall call, hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider the
adoption of this Agreement, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders (and
in any event no later than 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement),
and the Companys obligation to call, hold, and convene such meeting in
accordance with this _Section 5.3_ shall not be affected by (i)
the commencement, proposal, disclosure, or announcement of any Competing
Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal, amendment, or modification of the
recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company that the stockholders
of the Company vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement, unless in either
case the Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_. Subject to
_Sections 4.2(b)(iii)_ and _4.2(c)_ , (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement at the Companys stockholders meeting and the
Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the
Companys stockholders meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Companys stockholders meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Companys
stockholders meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such meeting; _provided_ , that no adjournment may be to a date
on or after three Business Days prior to the date set forth in _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_.

  

5.4 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

  

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the Premerger
Notification Rules (as defined below) or other applicable Antitrust Laws (as
defined below) to which _Sections 5.4(b)_ and _(c)_ , and not this _Section
5.4(a)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities all authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications,
registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters.

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall make all premerger notification filings required
under the HSR Act (which shall be made no later than 15 Business Days after
the date hereof) or identified in _Schedule 3.1(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and _Schedule 3.2(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter
pursuant to the pre-merger notification rules identified therein (the "
_Premerger Notification Rules_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall: (i)
cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filings under any
Premerger Notification Rules; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed
of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to
any Antitrust Authority, and of any communication

       

received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that protects attorney-client
or attorney work product privilege; and (iii) permit the other party to
review and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any
communication given by it to any Antitrust Authority or in connection with
any proceeding by a private party related to Antitrust Laws with any other
Person, in each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that protects
attorney-client or attorney work product privilege. Unless otherwise agreed
and without limiting the obligations stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ , Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the
prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Premerger
Notification Rules and approval by any relevant Antitrust Authority;
_provided_ , that any reasonable action by Parent to resist or reduce the
scope of a Divestiture Action (as defined below) shall be deemed consistent
with such reasonable best effort, even if it delays such expiration to a date
not beyond the Termination Date. Further, without limiting the obligations
stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information regarding the Merger or filings under any Premerger Notification
Rules from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating any statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect of monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a dominant
position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any
state of the United States, the European Commission or any other competition
authority of any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Parent shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Antitrust
Authority or other Person relating to the Merger or filings under any
Premerger Notification Rules, including any communications with any Antitrust
Authority relating to any contemplated or proposed Divestiture Action,
_provided_ , that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. Neither party shall initiate, or participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity with respect to
any filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the
Merger or filings under any Premerger Notification Rules without giving the
other party reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the
extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and participate (which, at the request of either party, shall be
limited to outside antitrust counsel only); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Company nor Parent shall engage in any substantive communication
with any Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed Divestiture Action
without the consent of the other party.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but
not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and
agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; by consenting to
such action by the Company and _provided_ , that any such action may, at the
discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger)
(each a

       

" _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any
order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, (" _Antitrust Prohibition_ ") or to ensure that
no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise
approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the Termination
Date. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging
the Merger as violative of any Premerger Notification Rule or other Antitrust
Law, Parent shall take all action necessary, including but not limited to any
Divestiture Action to avoid or resolve such action.  In the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Termination Date. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in
resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action. The parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

  

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates
shall not take any action with the intention to or that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary
approval of any Antitrust Authority under an Premerger Notification Rule or
Antitrust Law or the expiration of the required waiting period under the
Premerger Notification Rules or any other Antitrust Laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may take any reasonable action to resist or reduce
the scope of a Divestiture Action, even if it delays such expiration to a
date not beyond the Termination Date.

  

(d) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company
and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned
upon consummation of the Merger.

  

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that on and after
the Effective Time, and for one year thereafter, officers and employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries not covered by any collective bargaining
agreement or labor contract who remain employed after the Closing by Parent
or any member of its "controlled group" within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code (the " _Parent Group_ "), including the Company or its Subsidiaries,
are provided base salary, base wages and annual and incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits (including defined benefit and retiree
health), plans and programs (excluding such plans relating to equity-based
compensation arrangements) which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable
than those made available by the Company and its Subsidiaries to its officers
and employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent
not duplicative of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, calculation of benefits and

       

vesting in all benefits provided by the Parent Group to officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such officers and employees
will be credited with their years of benefits eligibility service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof to the extent such
service with a predecessor was so recognized under analogous Employee Benefit
Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.  The
eligibility of any such officer or employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of
the Parent Group shall not be subject to any exclusions for any pre-
existing conditions if such individual had met the participation requirements
of similar benefit plans and programs of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time. Amounts paid before the Effective Time by such
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any health
plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall, after the Effective Time, be
taken into account in applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable
under the health plans of the Parent Group to the same extent as if such
amounts had, when paid, been paid under such health plans of the Parent
Group. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5(a)_ shall create any rights in
any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of continued employment for any specified period of any nature or kind
whatsoever or, except as set forth in the following sentence, limit Parents
or the Surviving Corporations power to amend or terminate any particular
Employee Benefit Plan or require (and the Company shall take no action that
would require) the Parent or Surviving Corporation to continue any
particular Employee Benefit Plan. To the extent that an agreement listed in
_Schedule 3.1(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter obligates the Company to
require a purchaser or merger partner to assume the terms of that agreement,
Parent agrees to recognize, and cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize,
the entity that is a party to such an agreement as the exclusive bargaining
representative of the covered employees and to adopt and cause the Surviving
Corporation to adopt, the terms of that agreement and any related and current
memorandums of agreement between the Company and such entity.

  

(b) For a period of at least twelve months from the Effective Time, Parent
Group shall not terminate or otherwise amend the severance plans described in
_Schedule 5.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in a manner adverse to any
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries covered by such
plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(c) The Company shall cooperate with Parent in respect of any material
contributions, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, that may be required or requested (by applicable plan
trustees, the PBGC or other applicable Governmental Entity, or otherwise) to
any Employee Benefit Plan (including any UK Benefit Plan), such cooperation
to include providing Parent with access to all meetings of or with the
person(s) or body(ies) requesting such contribution. The Company will
promptly notify Parent of any such request for contribution or meeting or any
other notice received from a Governmental Entity in respect of any Employee
Benefit Plan, other than a notice in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

  

5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined
below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification
agreement in effect

       

on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time and until the six
year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Employee
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties,
expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (with the
approval of the indemnifying party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), of or incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
which such Indemnified Person is a party based, in whole or in part, on or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary
under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Persons may retain the Companys regularly engaged legal
counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and
(ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter, _provided_ , that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Indemnified
Person wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 5.6_, upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this _Section
5.6_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such partys
position with respect to such claims) and, if required by law, shall deliver
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation an undertaking to repay any amounts
advanced to it if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification, but without any requirement for
the posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions other than those
expressly set forth herein; _provided_   _further_ , that Parent shall not be
obligated pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
single action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified
Persons, there is or may be a conflict of interests between

       

two or more of such Indemnified Persons, in which case there may be separate
counsel for each similarly situated group.

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 1.4_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder or under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws of any Indemnified Person to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by law. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor any
indemnification or exculpation agreements between the Company and any of its
directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon
request as provided in _Section 5.6(a)_, relating to the enforcement of such
Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section 5.6_ or under any charter,
bylaw or contract.

  

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, that in no event shall Parent be required to spend more than 300% (the "
_Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof (the amount of such premium being set forth in _Schedule
3.1(q)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) for the six years of coverage under
such tail policy; _provided_ _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, Parent shall purchase as much coverage as
is reasonably obtainable for the Cap Amount.

  

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.6_. The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance
coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this _Section 5.6_, and his
heirs and representatives. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or Surviving
Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this _Section 5.6_.

  

5.7 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
claim, action, suit, investigation or other legal or administrative
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages

       

in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Section 5.7 shall limit Parents or Merger Subs
obligations under _Section 5.4_ hereof. The Company shall give
Parent reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to
any Transaction; _provided_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed
to without Parents consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

5.8 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto will consult with each other
before issuing, and will provide each other reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or, to the extent practicable,
other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or, to the
extent practicable, make any other public statement prior to such
consultation, except as Parent, Merger Sub or the Company may be required by
applicable law, court order or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or as permitted by _Section
4.2_ (in which case such party will, to the extent practicable, promptly
inform the other parties hereto in writing in advance of such compelled
disclosure).

  

5.9 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to
compliance with all applicable laws, the Company and Parent, as the case may
be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other, report on operational
matters and shall promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any
change or event having, or which would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. Except with respect to
Premerger Notification Rules as provided in _Section 5.4_, the Company and
Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their respective counsel) copies
of all filings made by such party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or any

preparation, execution and filing of all applications or other documents
regarding any applicable exemptions to any such Tax or fee, and (c) each pay

5.11 _Investigation by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other Representations or
Warranties_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made
its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have requested such
documents and information from the Company as each such party considers
material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub

       

acknowledges and agrees that it has had an opportunity to ask all questions
of and receive answers from the Company in determining whether to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. In connection with such investigation, Parent, Merger Sub and
their Representatives have received from the Company or its Representatives
certain other estimates, projections and other forecasts for the Company and
its Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget information.

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in _Section
3.1_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter or as
disclosed in the SEC Documents) and in any certificate provided pursuant to
_Section 6.2(c)_, neither the Company nor any other Person has made and
shall not be deemed to have made any representation or warranty of any kind.
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that neither the Company, any holder of the Companys securities
nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, makes or has made
any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their representatives or Affiliates with respect to:

  

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or
made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives
or Affiliates; or

  

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates, except to the extent and as expressly covered
by a representation and warranty made by the Company and contained in
_Section 3.1_ of this Agreement.

  

5.12 _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including (i) using reasonable
best efforts to (x) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter; (y) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter; and (z) consummate the Financing at or prior to
Closing; and (ii) seeking to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.
Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive
agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.

  

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days, if at any time (i) the Commitment Letter
shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that
is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Parent

       

that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the
terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in
good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms described therein. Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior
written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any action or enter into
any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternate
Financing contemplated by any Alternate Financing. Parent shall not amend or
alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter in any manner that
would prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of Transactions
without the prior written consent of the Company.

  

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letter
shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent for
any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain, and,
if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing as such
Commitment Letter as originally issued, to the extent needed to fund the
Required Amounts, and on terms and conditions (including termination rights
and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than those
included in the Commitment Letter (the " _New Commitment Letter_ "). To the
extent applicable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions
described in any New Commitment Letter, including (i) using reasonable best
efforts to (x) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions
set forth in the New Commitment Letter; (y) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the New Commitment Letter; and (z) consummate the Alternate Financing at or
prior to the Closing and (ii) seeking to enforce its rights under the
New Commitment Letter. In the event Alternate Financing is obtained and a
New Commitment Letter is entered into, references in this Agreement to the
Commitment Letter shall be deemed to refer to the New Commitment Letter, as
applicable.

  

5.13 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification; Solvency Letter_.

  

(a) Except to the extent that the parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this _Article V_, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 4.2_), each of
the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the Financing including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
consents from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an any suit, action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, except with respect to Antitrust Authorities, which
shall be governed by _Section 5.4_ , (ii) the obtaining of all consents from
(A) third parties reasonably requested by Parent or the Company and (B) the
Persons set

       

forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, _provided_ ,
that, with respect to this clause (B), "reasonable best efforts" shall mean
and include the exercise or use, upon the reasonable request by (and for the
expense of) Parent, by the Company of all rights and remedies necessary or
available under the contract under which the consent is sought (but shall not
include the initiation of any legal proceeding unless Parent and the Company
mutually agree), to procure the waivers or consents to assignment set forth
in such _Schedule 5.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter ( _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the
consents referred to in clauses (A) and (B), (x) the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, pay or commit to pay to any Person whose consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than any de minimis
amounts), nor make any commitment to do the same, nor incur or agree to incur
any non-de minimis liability due to such Person in connection therewith and
(y) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
be required prior to the Closing to pay or commit to pay to any person whose
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than any de
minimis amounts), nor make any commitment to do the same, nor incur or agree
to incur any non-de minimis liability due to such Person in connection
therewith) and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and the Financing and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective officers and employees to provide, reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement and consummation of, and the
negotiation of agreements with respect to, the Financing (and any
substitutions or replacements thereof). In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall (i) cause the senior officers
of the Company to be reasonably available, on reasonable advance notice, to
Parent and Merger Sub and the financial institutions providing the Financing
to participate in due diligence sessions and to participate in presentations
(including any "road shows" or similar presentations) related with the
Financing, (ii) assist in the preparation of one or more appropriate and
customary offering documents and assisting Parent and Merger Sub and the

and customary marketing materials, in each case to be used in connection with
the Financing, (iii) request the Companys independent auditors to prepare
and deliver "comfort letters," dated the date of each offering document used
in connection with any transaction in connection with the Financing (with
appropriate bring down comfort letters delivered on the closing date of the
Financing), in compliance with professional standards and otherwise on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and (iv)
request that the administrative agent and collateral agent under the existing
credit facility of Huntsman International LLC (the " _Existing Credit
Agreement_ ") provide a debt payoff letter and related ancillary agreements,
in each of the foregoing cases as may be necessary and customary in
connection with a financing substantially similar to the Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be reimbursed promptly (and
in any event within 10 Business Days of providing invoices to Parent) by
Parent for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
foregoing.  Nothing contained in this _Section 5.13(b)_ shall require (i)
the Company or its senior officers to engage in any action that would
interfere unreasonably with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the
Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and other representatives for and against any

       

and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith except (x) with respect to information supplied by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein and/or (y) to the extent such losses and damages arise
from the willful misconduct of the Company or any of its or its Subsidiaries
officers, directors, employees or representatives.

  

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, financial
statements and other financial data of the Company as would be required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act if the Financing
were an offering by the Company alone which was being registered with the SEC
on a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any applicable successor form)
under the Securities Act (such financial statements and other financial data,
the " _Section 5.13(c) Financial Information_ "). The Company shall assist and
cooperate in good faith with Parent and its Affiliates in preparing all such
financial statements, including (i) permitting reasonable access to the
auditors, auditor workpapers (to the extent permitted by the auditors
preparing same), employees, books and records, and any financial data
(including updated budgets and projections) reasonably requested by Parent
and (ii) providing customary representations to auditors and any additional
financial information and assistance in connection therewith as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or its representatives in connection with any
filing with the SEC undertaken by Parent or its representatives; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall be reimbursed promptly (and in any event
within 10 Business Days of providing invoices to Parent) by Parent for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including auditors fees) that are incurred in
complying with the terms of this _Section 5.13(c)_.

  

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) any
condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the failure by it to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

(e) Parent and its Affiliates shall not (i) amend or otherwise change any of
its or Merger Subs organization documents, or (ii) enter into any
transaction or take any action, including asset sales, divestitures or other
distributions, or payment of dividends or other distributions, or any merger,
acquisition, investment, joint venture, lease, contract or financing that in
the case of clause (i) or (ii) could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in _Section 6.1_ or _6.3_.

  

(f) Parent shall deliver to the Company and the Companys Board of Directors
prior to the Closing a letter reasonably satisfactory to the Company (a "
_Solvency Letter_ ") addressed to the Company and the Companys Board of
Directors from an independent third party selected by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Appraiser_ ") opining that, immediately
after the Effective Time and after giving effect to the Merger and the other
Transactions (including the Financing), (i) the aggregate value of the
Surviving

       

Corporations assets will exceed its total liabilities (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities) at a fair valuation and
at fair saleable value; (ii) the Surviving Corporation will have the ability
to pay its total debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured and unliquidated liabilities) as they become due in the usual
course of its business; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct its business,
based upon (A) the proposed financing structure for the Merger and (B)
certain other financial information to be provided to the Appraiser by
Parent. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the form and substance of
the Solvency Letter and the Appraiser shall be deemed acceptable to the
Company if the same are acceptable to the financial institutions providing
the Financing (or any Alternate Financing pursuant to _Section 5.12_).

  

5.14 _5% Preferred Stock Conversion_. Upon the request of Parent on a date
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, the Company shall, or shall cause
the transfer agent under the 5% Preferred Stock to, commence a
provisional conversion (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion_ ") of the 5%
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 9(a)(ii) and the other applicable
provisions of the Certificate of Designations and applicable law.  The
Preferred Stock Conversion shall be conducted such that, subject to, and
effective immediately prior to, the Effective Time, all shares of
5% Preferred Stock shall have been converted pursuant to their terms into
that number of shares of Company Common Stock specified in the Certificate
of Designations.

  

5.15 _Debt Offer_.

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Merger Sub intends to commence a tender offer
and consent solicitation for some or all of the outstanding secured, senior
and subordinated notes issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Notes_ "), on the terms and conditions set forth in _Schedule 5.15_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Debt Offer_ "). Parent shall prepare
all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt
Offers, including the offers to purchase and consent solicitation statements,
related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the
" _Offer Documents_ "). The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and employees to provide,
reasonable cooperation in connection with the preparation of the Offer
Documents and the consummation of the Debt Offer, including with respect to
the Companys execution of supplemental indentures reflecting amendments to
the indentures applicable to the debt subject to any Debt Offer to the extent
approved by any required consents of holders of such debt. All mailings to
the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject
to the prior review and comment by the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be disseminated by Merger Sub to the holders of the
applicable Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.15_ , Merger Sub shall comply with the

       

requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable
law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the Debt
Offers. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable law conflict with
this _Section 5.15_ , the Merger Sub shall comply with the applicable law and
shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such
compliance.

  

(b) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of Merger Sub commencing or
closing a Debt Offer for any series of Notes, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by the indentures under which the Notes were issued, take
any actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption,
satisfaction and/or discharge or such series of Notes pursuant to such
applicable indenture at the Effective Time; _provided_ , that prior to the
Company being required to issue any irrevocable notice of redemption with
respect to any such series of Notes, which redemption cannot be conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall have, or shall have caused
to be, deposited with the trustee under such applicable indenture sufficient
funds to effect such redemption, satisfaction and discharge.

  

(c) All reasonable fees and expenses (and all other fees and expenses
consented to by Parent) incurred by the Company in connection with the
activities set forth in this _Section 5.15_ shall be paid by Parent. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors and other representatives for and against any
and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Debt Offer and any information contained in the Offer Documents in
connection therewith, except (i) with respect to information supplied by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and representatives in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein and (ii) to the extent such
losses and damages arise from the willful misconduct of the Company or any of
its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees or representatives.

  

5.16 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take such
actions as may be necessary to cause dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the procedures set
forth in such Rule 16b-3 and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC

second proviso of this _Section 7.1(b)(ii_ )), the condition set forth in the
first sentence of _Section 6.1(b)_ has not been met, the Termination Date
shall be extended ( _provided_ , that commitments to provide the Financing
(or any Alternate Financing) shall have been extended to the proposed
extended Termination Date and Parent and Merger Sub are in material
compliance with Section 5.4 hereof) by 90 days, upon the request of Parent or
the Company for such extension, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with Parent), that there exists
at such time an objectively reasonable probability of both (A) the condition
set forth in the first sentence of _Section 6.1(b)_ being met and (B) the
consummation of the Merger occurring within such subsequent 90 day period (it
being understood and agreed by the parties that any decision by the Board of
Directors of the Company to not extend the Termination Date as

       

provided in this third proviso shall in no way mitigate Parents obligations
under _Section 5.4_ ); and _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that if the
Marketing Period has commenced prior to the Termination Date (as extended
pursuant to the second or third proviso of this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ ) and
has not been completed by the Termination Date (as so extended), the
Termination Date (as so extended) shall be extended to the first Business Day
after the date on which the Marketing Period is completed; or

  

(iii) in the event of a breach by the other party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_
or _(b)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_ or _(b)_ , as applicable, if it was continuing
as of the Closing Date and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier
of 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such
breach and the basis for such notice, and the date of the proposed
termination (a " _Terminable Breach_ "); _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in Terminable Breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement;

  

(c) by Parent within 15 Business Days thereafter if (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company or the transaction committee thereof shall have
withdrawn, modified or changed, in any manner that is adverse to Parent, its
approval or recommendation to the stockholders of the Company with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger, (B) a tender or exchange offer that would
constitute a Competing Proposal is commenced and the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender or
exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof (it
being understood and agreed that any "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially
similar communication to the stockholders of the Company shall not be deemed
to constitute a withdrawal, modification or change of its recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger), or (C) the Company, the Board of Directors
of the Company or the transaction committee thereof approves or recommends
any Competing Proposal or approves any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any
Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement);

  

(d) by the Company (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company or the
transaction committee thereof shall have withdrawn, amended or modified its
recommendation, and recommended against adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger in accordance with _Section 4.2(c)_, or (ii) if the Board of
Directors of the Company or the transaction committee thereof changes its
recommendation in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)(iii)_ ; _provided_ , that
the Company may not effect such termination unless (1) the Company has
contemporaneously with such termination tendered payment to Parent of the fee
pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ and (2) with respect to the prior clause (ii)
only, the Company has not materially breached the terms of _Section 4.2_ ; or

  

(e) by the Company, if (A) except such conditions that, by their nature, can
only be satisfied at Closing, all conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived and (B) the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or prior to the Termination Date, other than as a result
of the Companys refusal to close in violation of this Agreement.

       



  

7.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination,
and, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.1(d)_, any termination shall
be effective immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other
party.

  

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party hereto as
provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto
except with respect to this _Section 7.2_, the fifth and sixth sentences of
_Section 5.2_, _Section 7.3_,  _Section 7.4_ (if applicable) and _Article
VIII_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such termination (or any provision
of this Agreement) shall relieve any party from liability for any damages
(including, in the case of the Company, claims for damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the stockholders of
the Company, and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, claims for damages
based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction) for a knowing and
intentional breach of any covenant hereunder.

  

7.3 _Expenses and Other Payments_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party hereto shall
pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying
out this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, whether or not
the Merger shall be consummated.

  

(b) If (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or
(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_,
then the Company shall pay Parent a fee of $225 **** million  _plus_ the
Reimbursement Amount, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent. If the fee shall be payable pursuant
to clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence, the fee shall be paid
no later than three Business Days after notice of termination of this
Agreement, and if the fee shall be payable pursuant to clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the fee shall be paid on the date of
termination of this Agreement.

  

(c) If either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
clause (B) of _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ and (i) (x) at the time of the
stockholders meeting there shall have been publicly announced a bona fide
Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , that any reference in the definition of
Competing Proposal to 25% shall be deemed to be a reference to 50.1% for the
purposes of this clause (x)) that shall have not been withdrawn at least five
Business Days prior to the date of the stockholders meeting or (y) at the
time of the stockholders meeting less than 50.1% of the total issued and
outstanding voting power of the Company Common Stock shall be contractually
committed (whether pursuant to the Voting Agreements or another similar
voting agreement with Parent) to vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger and (ii) within 12 months after the date of such
stockholders meeting, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to or **** consummates a Competing Proposal, then at the closing or
other consummation of such Competing Proposal the Company shall pay Parent
(I) under the circumstances in the foregoing clause (x), a fee of $225
million _plus_ the Reimbursement Amount

       

or (II) under the circumstances in the foregoing clause (y), the
Reimbursement Amount, in either case in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

  

(d) If (i) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(i)(A)_ and at that time there exists any Antitrust
Prohibition, (ii) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ including if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines not to extend the Termination Date pursuant to the third
proviso of _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ and (A) the condition specified in _Section
6.1(b)_ has not been satisfied or (B) there exists any Antitrust Prohibition,
(iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ as a result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of _Section 5.4_
or _Section 5.12_ , or (iv) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $325 million
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company. If the fee shall be payable pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as a result of a termination of this Agreement
by the Company, the fee shall be paid no later than three (3) Business Days
after notice of termination of this Agreement, and if the fee shall be
payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as a result of a
termination of this Agreement by Parent, the fee shall be paid on the date
of termination of this Agreement. If Parent does not pay the fee required to
be paid pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)_  when due and the Company provides
notice to Parent that such fee is due and payable, then Parent shall, not
later than two Business Days thereafter, (I) draw from the Financing (or
Alternate Financing) an amount not less than $325 million and cause such
funds to be held in an escrow account pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letter (or New Commitment Letter, as applicable) or (II) ensure that the
commitment contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or New Commitment Letter,
as applicable) shall have been extended, in either case until such time as
such amount is paid or either (x) a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final, non-appealable decision that no such amount will be
due and payable or (y) Parent and the Company mutually agree that no such fee
will be due and payable.

  

(e) In no event shall Parent or the Company be entitled to receive more than
one payment of a termination fee in addition to the payment of the
Reimbursement Amount.

  

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by it
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, interest shall accrue on such amount from
the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 8% per annum. If, in order
to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in
judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the
other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. Each of
the parties hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment of the
amounts by the Company specified in _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ nor
the payment of the amounts by Parent specified in _Section 7.3(d)_ is a
penalty, but in each case is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in
the circumstances in which such fees are payable and which do not involve
fraud or a knowing or intentional breach as described in _Section 7.2(b)_ for
the efforts and resources expended and the

       

opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the parties agree that the monetary remedies set forth in this _Section 7.3_
and in _Section 7.4_ and the specific performance remedies set forth in
_Section 8.11_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (A) the Company
and its Subsidiaries against Parent and Merger Sub and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, employees, representatives, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of fraud or
with respect to Parent and Merger Sub only, a knowing and intentional breach
as described in _Section 7.2(b)_ , and upon payment of such amount, none of
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, employees,
representatives, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby except in the case of fraud
or, with respect to Parent and Merger Sub only, a knowing and intentional
breach as described in _Section 7.2(b)_ ; and (B) Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future stockholders, managers, employees, representatives,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of
fraud or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, a knowing and
intentional breach as described in _Section 7.2(b)_ but subject to the terms
of _Section 8.10_ , and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, managers, employees, representatives, members, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby except in the case of fraud or, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a knowing and intentional breach as described in _Section
7.2(b)_ but subject to the terms of _Section 8.10_.

  

(g) In the event that Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ , then in the event that such termination
arises from a willful or intentional action by the breaching party, the
breaching party shall pay to the terminating party an amount equal to the
Reimbursement Amount, not later than three Business Days following the date
of termination; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall any payment be made by Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.3(g)_ in the
event that Parent is obligated to, or does, make the payment to the Company
contemplated by _Section 7.3(d)_.

  

(h) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and _(g)_ above, the Reimbursement
Amount shall not be repayable by the Company to Parent.

  

7.4 _Financing Breach_. In the event that (i) Parent and Merger Sub are in
compliance with the terms of _Section 5.12_ of this Agreement, (ii) the terms
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter with respect to
the Financing (or the definitive documentation entered into with respect to
any Alternate Financing obtained in the manner provided in, and consistent
with the terms of, _Section 5.12_ ) have been satisfied and (iii) one or more
of the financing institutions obligated to provide a portion of the Financing
(or such Alternate Financing) fails to provide its respective portion of such
financing and, as a result, the Closing does not occur, Parent and

       

Merger Sub shall, upon the request of the Company, promptly commence a
litigation proceeding against any breaching financial institution or
institutions in which it will use its best efforts to either (x) compel such
breaching institution or institutions to provide its portion of such
financing as required or (y) seek from the breaching institution or
institutions the maximum amount of damages available under applicable law as
a result of such breach.  Parent and Merger Sub further agree that any
amounts received by Parent and Merger Sub in settlement or resolution of any
such proceeding, net of any reasonable fees and expenses incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with any such proceeding, shall be paid to the
Company promptly following receipt thereof by Parent and Merger Sub;
_provided_ , that if such recovery is obtained prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall, subject to the
other terms and conditions contained herein, complete the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.4 _Rules of Construction_.

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution of this

       

Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting
and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and
any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be
deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its preparation.  Accordingly, any rule of law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is
hereby expressly waived.

  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, or that such items are
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Company
Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_
 merely for convenience, and the disclosure of (i) an item in one section of
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty and (ii) disclosures made in
the SEC Documents shall in each case be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent from such item, notwithstanding the presence or
absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or warranties or
an appropriate cross reference thereto.

  

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement.

  

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at
the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of
this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be
disregarded in construing the language contained therein.  The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section," "this
subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in masculine,
feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any

       

other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in
the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include
the singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such
defined terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a
specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas time.

  

8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, including via facsimile transmission, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

  

8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and any other documents and
instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Except for the
provisions of _Section 5.6_ (which from and after the Effective Time are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Persons
referred to therein and by their respective heirs and representatives),
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be construed to amend any Employee Benefit Plan.

  

8.7 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof.

  

(b) THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF
CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR, IF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE OR THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT DETERMINES THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING
SECTION 111 OF THE DGCL, THE COURT OF CHANCERY DOES NOT HAVE OR SHOULD NOT
EXERCISE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OVER SUCH MATTER, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE) AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SOLELY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE THAT
ARISES IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN RESPECT
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO
ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR INTERPRETATION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IT IS NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR
THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT
MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE

       

THEREOF MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT
MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION
OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE
AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN SECTION 8.3 OR IN SUCH
OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE
THEREOF.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.7_.

  

8.8 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement
or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate.

  

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties except that (i) prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders, Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion,
any or all of its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to
Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and
(ii) concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, Parent or Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its respective rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any debt financing source,
but, in either case (x) no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub
of any of its

       

obligations under this Agreement and (y) no such assignment shall be made
that could reasonably be expected to (1) have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or (2) cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section 8.9_
shall be void.

  

8.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as a
" _Company Affiliate_ ": (a) any direct or indirect holder of equity
interests or securities in the Company (whether limited or general partners,
members, stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director, officer or
employee of (i) the Company or (ii) any Person who controls the Company. No
Company Affiliate shall have any personal liability or personal obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under
this Agreement, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims
of any such liability and obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing waiver and release shall not apply to claims and obligations for
liability arising (i) under the reimbursement obligations under _Section 5.6_
, (ii) from intentional misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement
or fraud, or (iii) under the Voting Agreements or any other agreement entered
into with Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates by a Company
Affiliate in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

8.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity,
including monetary damages, but only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 7.2(b)_ , _Section 7.3_ or _Section 7.4_ ) to seek and obtain (a) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where the Parent and
Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not
been consummated on or prior to the earlier of the last day of the Marketing
Period or the Termination Date (other than as a result of the Companys
refusal to close in violation of this Agreement) the parties acknowledge that
the Company shall not be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
draw upon and cause the Financing to be funded if the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_  and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (other than conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until Closing) and the funds
contemplated by the Financing or any Alternate Financing shall be available.
Each party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section 8.11_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

  

8.12 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed
a representation, warranty, covenant

       

and agreement made by Parent and Merger Sub jointly and all liability and
obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub.

  

8.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which
by law would require the further approval by such stockholders without
first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

  

8.14 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed:  (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party.
