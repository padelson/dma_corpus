a schedule with respect thereto (the " _Closing Balance Sheet Schedule_ ").
The Closing Balance Sheet Schedule shall list those line items, if any, to
which the Seller takes exception and the SellerÂ’s proposed adjustment. If the
Seller fails to deliver to the Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet Schedule
within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Closing Balance

following receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet Schedule, the Buyer shall be

Closing Balance Sheet Schedule, and if the Seller and the Buyer are unable,
within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt by the Seller of the notice
from the Buyer of objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such
disputed exceptions will be referred to BDO Seidman, LLP or another firm of

identified by the Seller in the Closing Balance Sheet Schedule (and only such
disputed exceptions), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the Initial
Purchase Price under _Section 3.2_. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm acting under this _Section 3.1_ shall be
apportioned between the Buyer and the Seller based on the total dollar value
of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each such party, with each such
party bearing such percentage of the fees and disbursements of the

considered by the Independent Accounting Firm.

directors of the Companies set forth on _Schedule 7.1_ to submit letters
of resignation effective on or before the Closing.

  

Section 7.2. _Covenants Not To Compete and Non-Solicitation Covenants_.

  

### (a) Seller agrees that from the Closing Date until the thirty-six (36)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any Competing
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the sale by Seller or any of its
Affiliates of any of their products (other than Instant Tickets) offered for
sale, or contemplated to be offered for sale, as of the Closing Date, shall
not be deemed to be engaging

        

### directly or indirectly in a Competing Business and shall not be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 7.2(a).

  

### (b) Seller agrees that from the date hereof until the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, endeavor to entice away from any of
the Companies, or otherwise interfere with the relationship of any of the
Companies with any Person who is, or was within the eighteen (18) month
period prior to the Closing Date, a client, customer, vendor or supplier of
any of the Companies, in each case, for purposes of providing to any such
client, customer, vendor or supplier any services that would be competitive
with a Competing Business.

  

### (c) The Seller acknowledges that the officers and other employees of the
Companies are valuable to the operation of the business of the Companies.
Accordingly, the Seller agrees that from the date hereof until the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, hire or attempt to hire, solicit,
induce, recruit or encourage any of the officers or other employees of any of
the Companies to terminate their employment relationship with any of the
Companies in order to work for any other Person; provided, that nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit (i) the Seller or any of its Affiliates from
hiring Emmanuele Savare and Jean-Francois Durand; (ii) hiring or attempting
to hire, solicit, induce or recruit any officer or employee that has been
terminated by one of the Companies for cause or without cause; or (iii)
hiring or attempting to hire any officer or employee with the prior written
consent of the Buyer.

  

### (d) It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions
of this _Section 7.2_  shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any particular
provisions or portions of this _Section 7.2_ shall be adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, such provisions or portion thereof shall be deemed
amended to the minimum extent necessary to render such provision or portion
valid and enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the
operation of such provisions or portions in the particular jurisdiction
in which such adjudication is made. In addition, the Seller acknowledges and
agrees that damages and remedies at law for any breach of this _Section 7.2_
will be inadequate and impractical, that such breach would cause the Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Companies) irreparable harm and that the
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall be entitled to
specific performance and other equitable remedies (including an injunction
and tortuous interference claims) and such other relief as a court or
tribunal specified in Section 14.2 may deem appropriate in addition to any
other remedies that Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies) may
have under applicable law or under the terms of this Agreement.

  

Section 7.3. _FCPA Disclosure Statement_. The Seller will complete, sign,
and return to the Buyer along with this executed Agreement the FCPA
Disclosure Statement attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit C_ , and it will
immediately provide the Buyer with any supplementary report _required_  under
_Exhibit C_.

anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date with compensation and employee benefits that are substantially the same
in the aggregate (excluding any equity-based compensation) to the
compensation and employee benefits provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
in the event that the employment of any employee shall be terminated by any
Company prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date for any reason,
Buyer shall cause such Company to provide, at BuyerÂ’s expense, each such
employee with severance benefits at least equivalent to the severance
benefits to which such employee would have been entitled under the CompaniesÂ’
severance benefit practices on the date hereof, and set forth on  _Schedule
8.1(a)_. Buyer shall specifically assume any Company Plans for which specific
assumption is required by applicable law.

  

### (b) As of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Companies to
continue all Company Plans (other than Company Plans that are U.S. Plans)
(the " _Continued Plans_ "), and the benefits thereunder, until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with their terms and applicable
law. Following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Continued Plans may
be amended or terminated as determined by the Buyer in its sole discretion.
To the extent that any Company Employee become eligible to participate in any
employee benefit plans, programs and agreements maintained by or contributed
to by Buyer and its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the
prior service with the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries of
any Company Employee (to the same extent such service is recognized under
analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date) as service rendered to
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for all purposes;
provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not (i) operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit under any plan, (ii)
require the crediting of past service for benefit accrual purpose under any
defined benefit pension plan or similar arrangement or (iii) with respect to
any newly adopted plan, program or arrangement, be credited if past
service credit will not be provided to employees of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries participating in such plan. Buyer shall also cause each employee
benefit plan, program and agreement maintained by or contributed to by Buyer
and its Subsidiaries to waive any preexisting condition or waiting period
limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or
after the Closing Date (to the extent such limitation would not apply under
the corresponding Company Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Buyer
Plan that could replace a Canadian Plan in Quebec shall first be registered
in Quebec and shall comply with the provisions of the SPPA.

  

Section 8.2. _Access After the Closing_. The Buyer shall afford the Seller,
and to the accountants, counsel and representatives of the Seller, reasonable
access on and after the Closing Date to those portions of the properties,
assets, books, Contracts, and files and records of the Companies that relate
to activities prior to the Closing Date (as well as to the employees and

        

auditors of the Companies with knowledge of the activities of the Companies
prior to the Closing Date) so as to permit the Seller to comply with
applicable financial reporting, tax and any other legal requirement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Seller and its representatives shall
take such action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of the
Buyer to schedule such access and visits in such a way as to avoid disrupting
the normal business of the Buyer, (ii) the Buyer shall not be required to
take any action that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege and (iii) the Buyer need not supply the Seller with any
information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Buyer, the Buyer or the
Companies are under a contractual, fiduciary or legal obligation not to
supply.

  

Section 8.3. _Use of Intellectual Property._

  

### (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it has no rights in and to any
marks or names owned, used or licenses by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than any Company) including the "OBERTHUR," "FRANÃ‡OIS-CHARLES
OBERTHUR," "FCO" and "FCOF" names and marks (the " _Marks_ ") and, following
the Closing Date, Buyer and the Companies shall not have any right, title or
interest in and to, or right to use, the Marks or any marks or names
confusingly similar thereto.

  

### (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall take
whatever steps are necessary to change the name of each Company to a name
that does not include any of the Marks or any term similar or related
thereto, and to otherwise cease use of the Marks, and shall take all actions
necessary and appropriate to de-register the name of each of the Companies
with the appropriate Governmental Entities and to register each CompanyÂ’s new
name with such authorities and forward a copy of such filing to Seller
forthwith following receipt.

event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, each Company
shall take whatever steps are necessary to change any "doing business as"
designations of "OBERTHUR," "FRANÃ‡OIS-CHARLES OBERTHUR," "FCO" and "FCOF" to
a designation that does not include "OBERTHUR," "FRANÃ‡OIS-CHARLES OBERTHUR,"
"FCO" and "FCOF" or any of the other Marks with any term similar thereto, and
to otherwise cease use of such name, and shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to cancel such "doing business as" designation with the
appropriate Governmental Entities.

  

### (d) Buyer covenants that after the Closing Date and except as provided
for in this _Section 8.3_ , it will not, and will cause each Company to not,
adopt, use or register or authorize others to adopt, use or register, any
trade names, trademarks, service marks or Internet domain names consisting of
or incorporating the Marks or any marks, names or Internet domain names
confusingly similar thereto.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties provided by Seller pursuant to _Article 5_
shall not apply to the Marks.

  

Section 8.4. _Guarantees_. After the Closing, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently cooperate with the Seller to
assume, reject or terminate as soon as

        

practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days after Closing, guarantees
of the Business (including any letters of credit, security interests,
obligations and other similar undertakings) provided by Seller or Affiliates
of the Seller; provided that in any event Seller or its respective Affiliates
shall be permitted to terminate such guarantees (including any letters of
credit, security interests, obligations and other similar undertakings) after
the 90th day if the Buyer fails to assume, reject or terminate
such guarantees (including any irrevocable letters of credit, security
interests, obligations and other similar undertakings) within such 90-day
period after the Closing. After the Closing, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently assist the Buyer with its
efforts to assume, reject or terminate guarantees of the Business (including
any letters of credit, security interests, obligations and other similar
undertakings) provided by Seller or Affiliates of the Seller.

Return and, with respect to each Straddle Period Tax Return, shall notify
Seller in writing of BuyerÂ’s calculation of SellerÂ’s share of the Taxes of
each Company relating to such Straddle Period (determined in accordance with

Closing Period Tax Return and Straddle Period Tax Return and, with respect to
each Straddle Period Tax Return, the calculation of SellerÂ’s share of the Tax
liability for such Straddle Period (determined in accordance with this
_Section 9.4_ ), in each case, shall be subject to SellerÂ’s review and
approval. If Seller disputes any item on such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return
or Straddle Period Tax Return and/or, with respect to any Straddle Period Tax
Return, the calculation of SellerÂ’s share of liability for such Straddle
Period, it shall notify Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the basis

attributable to Taxes paid by any Company with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period except to the extent such refunds or credits are taken into account on
the Closing Balance Sheet, and (b) the portion of all refunds of Taxes or
credits of Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) received by any
of Buyer or its Affiliates or any Company after the Closing Date and
attributable to Taxes paid by any Company with respect to any Straddle Period
(such portion to be allocated in a manner consistent with the principles set
forth in _Section 9.3_ ) except to the extent such refunds or credits are
taken into account on the Closing Balance Sheet. Any such refunds or credits
of Taxes required to be paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this _Section
9.6_ shall be paid within five Business Days of the receipt of such refunds
or credits of Taxes by Buyer, its Affiliates or any Company. The Buyer shall
and shall cause each Company to cooperate with the Seller in obtaining
refunds and credits of the Companies relating to Pre-Closing Periods and
Straddle Periods (including through amendment of Tax Returns).

Tax of any Company for any Tax period for which one party could reasonably
require the assistance of the other party in obtaining any necessary
information. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to,

audits and promptly forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or
other communications received from or sent to any Taxing authority which
relate to any Company, and providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns of
any Company, together with accompanying schedules and related work papers,
documents relating to rulings received by any Company or other determinations
by any Taxing authority with respect to any Company and records concerning
the ownership and Tax basis of property of any Company, which the requested
party may possess. Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall
make their respective

        

employees and facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to explain
any documents or information provided hereunder.

  

Section 9.8. _Tax Audits_. Buyer shall deliver a written notice to Seller
in writing promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of
a claim, proposed adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative
or court proceeding with respect to Taxes of any Company for which Seller may
be liable pursuant to this  _Article 9_ (" _Tax Contest_ ") and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by Buyer or such Company)
the facts constituting the basis for such Tax Contest, the nature of the
relief sought, and the amount of the claimed Losses, if any (the " _Tax Claim
Notice_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of
Buyer to notify Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.8_  shall relieve Seller
of any liability or obligations under _Article 9_  except to the extent that
Seller is prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

  

### (a) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of any Company for a Pre-
Closing Period, Seller may elect to assume and control the defense of such
Tax Contest by written notice to Buyer within sixty (60) days after delivery

control; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that _Sections 10.2(b)(iii) and (v)_ ,

Section 10.4. _Procedures for Indemnification_.

  

### (a) If a party entitled to indemnification under this _Article 10_ (an "
_Indemnitee_ ") asserts that a party obligated to indemnify it under this
_Article 10_ (an " _Indemnitor_ ") has become obligated to such Indemnitee
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ , or if any suit, action, investigation,
claim or proceeding is begun, made or instituted as a result of which the
Indemnitor may become obligated to an Indemnitee under _Section 10.2_ or
_10.3_ , such Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Indemnitor; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure of

  

### 

        

### 

  

### the Indemnitee to give notice to the Indemnitor shall not release the
Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent
the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest or otherwise
protect the Indemnitee against any such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnitor so elects to
defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall (i)
make available to the Indemnitor all relevant books and records in its
possession and (ii) cooperate and assist the Indemnitor to the extent
reasonably possible. The Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by
counsel of the IndemniteeÂ’s choice.  If the Indemnitor fails to defend,
contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action, investigation, claim
or proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to do so, including,
without limitation, the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof,
and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from
the Indemnitor, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees,
disbursements and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding.

  

### (b) _Recoupment Under the Letter of Credit_. From and after the Closing
Date (but subject to _Article 10_ ), a Buyer Indemnitee shall first be
required to seek recovery with respect to any Loss pursuant to _Article 9_
and this _Article 10_ from the Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms
of _Section 2.3_.

  

Section 10.5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (a) absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation
on the part of any party or a claim for injunctive relief, indemnification
claims brought in accordance with and subject to either _Article 9_ or this
_Article 10_, as the case may be, shall be the exclusive remedy of any
Indemnitee after the Closing with respect to, arising out of or resulting
from the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except as provided in
_Section 9.9_ , this _Article 10_ shall not apply to Taxes or Tax Returns or
any matter governed by _Article 9_.

  

Section 10.6. _Mitigation_. Each Indemnitee shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that such
Indemnitee asserts under _Article 9_ and this _Article 10_. In the event
that an Indemnitee shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor shall not be required to indemnify
such Indemnitee for that portion of any Loss that could reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if such Indemnitee had made such efforts.

  

Section 10.7. _Limitation on Losses_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Losses shall be reduced to the
extent of any insurance payments received by an Indemnitee for such Losses;
provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 10.7_ shall provide a basis
for any Indemnitor to delay making any payments otherwise required to be made
by it hereunder. Each Indemnitee shall use its best efforts to file and
pursue any insurance payments which may be owing in order to mitigate such
Losses.

Any party may change its address for the purpose of this Section by giving
the other parties written notice of its new address in the manner set forth
above.

  

Section 14.6. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR
HEREBY.

  

Section 14.7. _Amendments; Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the
parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance.
Any waiver by any party of any condition, or of the breach of any provision,
term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in
any one or more instances, shall not be deemed to be nor construed as a
further or continuing waiver of any such condition, or of the breach of any
other provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty of this
Agreement.

  

Section 14.8. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that after the
signing of this Agreement, the Seller shall not, and shall not permit the
Companies to, and the Buyer shall not, make any press release or public
announcement concerning this transaction without the prior written approval
of the other parties, unless a press release or public announcement
is required by applicable law, regulation or requirement of any
securities exchange. Before a party makes any such announcement or other
disclosure required by law, regulation or requirement of any securities
exchange, such party agrees to give the other parties prior notice and an
opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.

  

Section 14.9. _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2006, between the Seller

All Exhibits and schedules hereto and any documents and instruments
delivered pursuant to any provision hereof are expressly made a part of this
Agreement, as fully as though completely set forth herein.

  

Section 14.10. _Parties in Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement on any
Persons other than parties hereto and their respective successors and

the Buyer. No provision of this Agreement shall give any third parties any
right of subrogation or action over or against the Seller or the Buyer.

  

Section 14.11. _Scheduled Disclosures_. Disclosure of any matter, fact or
circumstance in a Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosure
thereof for purposes of any other Schedule hereto to the extent that such
matter, fact or circumstance would, on its face, apply as a disclosure under
such other Schedule.  Any disclosure on a Schedule to this Agreement of any
contract, document, liability, default, breach, violation, limitation,
impediment or other matter, although the provision for such disclosure may
require such disclosure only if such contract, document, liability, default,
breach, violation, limitation, impediment or other matter be "material,"
shall not be construed against any party to this Agreement, as an assertion
by such party, that any such contract, document, liability, default, breach,
violation, limitation, impediment or other matter is, in fact, material.

  

Section 14.12. _Enforcement of Certain Sections of the Agreement_.  The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if Sections 7.2 and

being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  

Section 14.13. _Section and Paragraph Headings_. The section and paragraph
headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 14.14. _Counterparts and Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
shall constitute the same instrument.  Executed signature pages to this
Agreement may be delivered by facsimile and such facsimiles will be deemed as
sufficient as if actual signature pages bad been delivered.

  

Section 14.15. _Language_. The Parties hereto acknowledge that they
have requested that this Agreement and any Transaction Documents be drafted
in the English language. Les parties aux presentes reconnaissent quÂ’elles
ont exige que la presente convention et tous les documents de transactions
qui sÂ’y rattachent soient rediges en anglais.

  

Section 14.16. _Reasonable Assurances_. For a reasonable period of time
after the Closing, if any further action is necessary to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such all actions, and to do,
or

        



  

cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable consistent with
applicable law to consummate and make effective in an expeditious manner the
transactions contemplated hereby.
