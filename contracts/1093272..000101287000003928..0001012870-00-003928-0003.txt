    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of July 11,
2000, among PMC-Sierra, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Penn
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Quantum Effect Devices, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Company").   Recitals   A. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), Parent, Merger Sub and Company intend to
enter into a business combination transaction.   B. The Board of Directors
of Company (i) has determined that the Merger (as defined in Section 1.1) is
consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of
Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, Company and its
stockholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) has determined
to recommend that the stockholders of Company adopt this Agreement.   C.
The Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement: (1) certain Company Affiliates (as defined in Section 5.11(a)) are
entering into Voting Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Company Voting Agreements"); (2) certain Company Affiliates
are entering into Company Affiliate Agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 (the "Company Affiliate Agreements"); and (3)
certain individuals are entering into Noncompetition Agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Noncompetition
Agreements").   E. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt
a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   F. It is also intended by
the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify for accounting treatment as
a pooling of interests.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants,
promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   The Merger  
1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject
to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company
(the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Company as
the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time   1   of such
filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent
and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as herein defined).
The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, at a time and
date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto
agree in writing (the "Closing Date").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the
Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation;
Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
5.10, the Certificate of Incorporation of Company shall be amended and
restated to be the same in substance as the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that
the name of Company will remain unchanged), and said amended and restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   (b) At the Effective
Time, subject to the provisions of Section 5.10, the Bylaws of Company shall
be amended and restated to be the same in substance as the Bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended
and restated Bylaws shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended.   1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be a combination of (a) all of the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) all of the
directors of Company who are also employees of Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any
of the following securities, the following shall occur:   (a) Conversion of
Company Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any share of Company Common Stock to
be canceled and extinguished pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be
automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and (f)) into 0.385 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent (the "Parent Common Stock"). If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of
such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends.   (b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned
Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger
Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or
of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Stock Options; Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company
Common Stock then outstanding under Company\'s 1999 Equity Incentive Plan and
1999 Non-Employee Directors\' Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Company
Option Plans"), and the Company   2   Option Plans themselves, shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8. At the Effective Time, all
purchase rights then outstanding under Company\'s 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), and the ESPP itself, shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with Section 5.8.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each
share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger
Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange
Ratio and any other applicable numbers or amounts shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
occurring or having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.   (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would
be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s
Certificates(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)) receive from Parent an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of
one share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) most recent days that
Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq").  
1.7 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate
or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d).
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock
were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), payment in lieu of fractional
shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable   3   pursuant to
Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the ownership of the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been so converted (including any voting, notice or
other rights associated with the ownership of such shares of Parent Common
Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or under
Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).   (d)
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby when the holders of
record of such Certificates surrender such Certificates.   (e) Transfers of
Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such
exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or (ii) established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax
has been paid or is not payable.   (f) Required Withholding. Each of the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration
of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.   1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the
event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash for fractional
shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided,
however, that the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and the payment of cash and other distributions, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   4    1.10 Tax and Accounting Consequences.   (a) It is
intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.   (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall be treated as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes.   1.11
Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take
all such necessary action.   ARTICLE II   Representations and Warranties

make nor is obligated to make nor is bound by any written or oral agreement,

Effect on Company.   2.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Company

violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents, and no

currently due in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual
Property have been made. All necessary documents, recordations and
certificates in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual Property
have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other
authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may
be, for the purposes of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual
Property.   14    (d) Except as set forth in Section 2.17(d) of the
Company Schedule, Company owns and has good title to or has all necessary
licenses to each material item of Company Intellectual Property free of any
Encumbrance (excluding rights of licensors and non-exclusive licenses and
related restrictions granted in the ordinary course). In this paragraph the
term "Encumbrance" excludes infringement of Company Intellectual Property by
third parties.   (e) To the extent that any Intellectual Property that has
been developed or created independently by a third party or jointly with a
third party for Company or any of its subsidiaries is used by Company or is
incorporated into any Company Products, Company has a written agreement with
such third party with respect thereto and Company thereby either (i) has
obtained ownership of, and is the exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained a
perpetual, non-terminable license to all such Intellectual Property.   (f)
Except as set forth in Section 2.17(f) of the Company Schedule,
neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has transferred ownership of, or
granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Intellectual Property that
is material Company Intellectual Property, to any third party, or
knowingly permitted Company\'s rights in such material Company Intellectual
Property to lapse or enter the public domain.   (g) Section 2.17(g) of the
Company Schedule lists all material contracts, licenses and agreements to
which Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party: (i) with respect to
Company Intellectual Property licensed or transferred to any third party
(other than end-user licenses in the ordinary course); or (ii) pursuant to
which a third party has licensed or transferred any Intellectual Property to
Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (h) Except as set forth in Section
2.17(h) of the Company Schedule, all contracts, licenses and agreements
listed in Section 2.17(g) of the Company Schedule are in full force and
effect. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will neither violate nor result in the breach, modification, cancellation,
termination or suspension ("Termination") of such contracts, licenses and
agreements by their terms. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is in
material compliance with any such contracts, licenses and agreements. To the
knowledge of Company, all other parties to such contracts, licenses and
agreements are in compliance with, and have not materially breached any term
of, such contracts, licenses and agreements, which breach has not been cured.
Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to
exercise all of Company\'s rights under such contracts, licenses and
agreements by their terms to the same extent Company and its
subsidiaries would have been able to had the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not occurred and without the payment of any additional amounts
or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Company
would otherwise be required to pay. There is no provision in any of
Company\'s contracts or agreements which, as a result of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, requires Parent or Merger
Sub to (i) grant to any third party any right to or with respect to any
material Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed to, either of them, (ii)
be bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other material restriction on
the operation or scope of their respective businesses, or (iii) be obligated
to pay any royalties or other material amounts to any third party in excess
of those payable by Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, prior to the
Closing.   (i) To Company\'s knowledge, Company\'s and its subsidiaries\'
design, development, manufacture, distribution, reproduction, marketing or
sale of the products of Company and its subsidiaries has not infringed or
misappropriated and does not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual
Property of any third party, and does not constitute unfair competition or
trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction.   (j) Neither Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice from any third party
that the operation of the business of Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any act, product or service of Company or any of its subsidiaries, infringes
or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any third party or
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of any
jurisdiction.   (k) To the knowledge of Company, no person has infringed or
misappropriated or is infringing or misappropriating any Company Intellectual
Property.    15    (l) Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken
reasonable steps to protect Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' rights in
Company\'s confidential information and trade secrets that it wishes to
protect or any trade secrets or confidential information of third parties
provided to Company or any of its subsidiaries. Each of Company and its
subsidiaries has a policy requiring each employee and contractor to execute a
proprietary information/confidentiality agreement substantially in the form
provided to Parent. All current and former employees and contractors of
Company and any of its subsidiaries have executed such an agreement, except
where the failure to do so would not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company.   2.18 Agreements, Contracts and
Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section
2.17(g) or Section 2.18 of the Company Schedule, neither Company nor any of
its subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by:   (a) any written employment

corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise other
than Company\'s subsidiaries;   (e) any dealer, distributor, joint marketing
or development agreement under which Company or any of its subsidiaries have
continuing material obligations to jointly market any product, technology or
service and which may not be canceled without material penalty upon notice of
ninety (90) days or less, or any material agreement pursuant to which Company
or any of its subsidiaries have continuing material obligations to jointly
develop any intellectual property that will not be owned, in whole or in
part, by Company or any of its subsidiaries and which may not be canceled
without material penalty upon notice of ninety (90) days or less;   (f) any

Act.   16    Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor to
Company\'s knowledge any other party to a Company Contract (as defined
below), is in material breach, violation or default under a Company Contract.
Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice
within the last twelve months that it has breached, violated or defaulted
under, any of the material terms or conditions of any of the agreements,
contracts or commitments to which Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which it is bound that are required to be disclosed in the
Company Schedule pursuant to this Section 2.18 (any such agreement, contract
or commitment, a "Company Contract") in such a manner as would permit any
other party to cancel or terminate any such Company Contract, or would permit
any other party to seek material damages or other remedies (for any or all of
such breaches, violations or defaults, in the aggregate).   2.19 Opinion of
Financial Advisor. Company has been advised by its financial advisor, Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated, that in its opinion, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock from a financial point of view, and Company shall provide to
Parent a copy of the written confirmation of such opinion as soon
as available.   2.20 Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Company has,
as of the date of this Agreement, (i) approved, subject to stockholder
adoption of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) determined that the Merger is
consistent with the long-term business strategy of Company and is in the best
interests of the stockholders of Company and is on terms that are fair to
such stockholders and (iii) determined to recommend that the stockholders of
Company adopt this Agreement.   2.21 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote with respect to the Merger is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of Company\'s capital stock necessary to adopt this
Agreement.   2.22 Pooling of Interests. To its knowledge, based on
consultation with its independent accountants, Company believes that neither
Company nor any of its directors, officers or affiliates has taken any action
which will interfere with Parent\'s ability to account for the Merger as a
pooling of interests.   2.23 Customers. Section 2.23 of the Company Schedule
lists the Company\'s ten largest customers based on revenues during the
twelve-month period ended June 30, 2000 and specifies the amounts invoiced
(in the aggregate) to each such customer in such period. As of the date
hereof, Company has not received any written communication indicating that
any of such customers intends to cease doing business with Company or
materially alter the amount of business that such customer currently conducts
with Company. Company has made available to Parent true and correct copies of
any contracts Company may have with its top ten customers.   2.24 Labor
Matters. No work stoppage or labor strike against Company is pending or, to
Company\'s knowledge, threatened or reasonably anticipated. Company does not
know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
employees. Except as set forth in Section 2.24 of the Company Schedule, there
are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to
the knowledge of Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to
any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any
Employee, including, without limitation, charges of unfair labor practices
or discrimination complaints, which, if adversely determined, would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to
Company. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in any
unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act. Except as set forth in Section 2.24 of the Company Schedule, Company is
not presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees
and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Company.  
2.25 Environmental Matters. Company: (i) has obtained all applicable permits,
licenses and other authorizations that are required under Environmental Laws
the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on Company and all
such permits are valid and in full force and effect; (ii) is in compliance
in   17   all material respects with all material terms and conditions of
such required permits, licenses and authorizations, and also is in compliance
in all material respects with all other material limitations, restrictions,
conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and
timetables contained in such laws or contained in any regulation, code, plan,
order, decree, judgment, notice or demand letter issued, entered, promulgated
or approved thereunder; (iii) as of the date hereof, has no knowledge of and
has not received written notice of any environmental event,
condition, circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action or plan that is
reasonably likely to materially interfere with the continued conduct of
Company\'s business activities, or prevent continued compliance in all
material respects with Environmental Laws, or that would give rise to any
material common law or statutory liability, or otherwise form the basis of
any material Environmental Claim with respect to Company, or any person or
entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim Company has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law; (iv) has not disposed
of, released, discharged or emitted any Hazardous Materials into the soil or
groundwater at any properties owned or leased at any time by Company, or at
any other property, or exposed any employee or other individual to any
Hazardous Materials or condition in such a manner as would result in any
material liability or result in any material corrective or remedial action
obligation; (v) has not assumed liabilities of any person or entity either
contractually or by operation of law for any release or discharge of any
Hazardous Materials into the soil or groundwater, or any exposure to an
employee or other individual to any Hazardous Materials which has caused or
could reasonably be expected to cause an adverse health effect to any such
employee or other individual; (vi) has taken all actions necessary under
Environmental Laws to register any products or materials required to be
registered by Company (or any of its agents) thereunder; (vii) has conducted
its business in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws; and (viii) has transferred or released Hazardous Materials only to
those Disposal Sites set forth in Section 2.25 of the Company Schedule, and
no action, proceeding, liability or claim exists or is threatened against any
Disposal Site or against Company with respect to any transfer or release
of any Hazardous Materials which could reasonably be expected to subject
Company to material liability. To Company\'s knowledge, no Hazardous
Materials are present in, on or under any properties owned, leased or used at
any time (including both land and improvements thereon) by Company, and no
reasonable likelihood exists that any Hazardous Materials will come to be
present in, on or under any properties owned, leased, operated, occupied or
used at any time (including both land and improvements thereon) by Company,
or were present on any other property at the time it ceased to be owned,
leased, operated, occupied, or used by Company, in each case so as to give
rise to any material liability or corrective or remedial obligation of
Company under any Environmental Laws. Company has delivered to Parent or made
available for inspection by Parent and its agents, representatives and
employees all records in Company\'s possession relating to compliance with
Environmental Laws, environmental audits and environmental assessments of any
property owned, leased, occupied or used by Company or any entity whose
liability for any Environmental Claim Company has retained or assumed either
contractually or by operation of law. Company has complied in all material
respects with all environmental disclosure obligations imposed by applicable
law with respect to this transaction. Section 2.25 of the Company Schedule
accurately describes all of the permits required under Environmental Laws
currently held by Company. Company has no knowledge of any circumstance that
exists which could cause any permit required under Environmental Laws to be
revoked, modified or rendered non-renewable upon payment of the permit fee.
For the purposes of this Section 2.25, "Environmental Claim" means any
notice, claim, act, cause of action or investigation by any person (including
any governmental agency) alleging potential liability (including potential
liability for investigatory costs, cleanup costs, governmental response
costs, natural resources damages, property damages, personal injuries or
penalties) arising out of, based on or resulting from (i) the presence, or
release into the environment, of any Hazardous Materials or (ii) any
violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental Laws. "Environmental
Laws" means all Federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
relating to pollution of the environment (including ambient air, surface
water, ground water, land surface or subsurface strata) or the protection of
human health and worker safety, including, without limitation, laws and
regulations relating to emissions, discharges, releases or
threatened releases of Hazardous Materials, or otherwise relating to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling of Hazardous Materials. "Hazardous Materials" means
chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, radioactive
and biological materials, asbestos-containing materials, hazardous
substances, petroleum and petroleum products or   18   any fraction
thereof, excluding, however, Hazardous Materials contained in products
typically used for office and janitorial purposes properly and
safely maintained in accordance with Environmental Laws. "Disposal Site"
means a landfill, disposal agent, waste hauler or recycler of Hazardous
Materials.   2.26 Insurance. Company has provided to Parent the insurance
policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business, equipment,
properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of Company and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Insurance Policies"). There is no material
claim by Company or any of its subsidiaries pending under any of the material
Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds.   2.27 State
Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of Company has taken all actions so
that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware Law applicable
to a "business combination" (as defined in such Section 203) will not apply
to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or to the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the knowledge of Company, no other state takeover statute
is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.   ARTICLE III   Representations and Warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub   Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Company, subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in writing in
the disclosure letter supplied by Parent to Company dated as of the date

Parent and each of its subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to do business
as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing (with respect
to jurisdictions which recognize such concept), under the laws of
all jurisdictions where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by them or the nature of their activities requires such
qualification or licensing and where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed would have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   3.2 Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws. Parent has previously furnished to Company
complete and correct copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as
amended and in effect as of the date of this   19   Agreement (together,
the "Parent Charter Documents"). Such Parent Charter Documents and equivalent
organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries are in full force and
effect. Parent is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Parent
Charter Documents, and no subsidiary of Parent is in violation of any of its
equivalent organizational documents except where the violation of any such
equivalent organizational documents of a subsidiary of Parent would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   3.3 Capitalization. As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of Parent consists of (i) 900,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of

consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Company, constitutes the legal
and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general
application affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights and the exercise
by courts of equitable powers.   3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and

(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair
Parent\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party against or to Parent under, or give to others
any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of an Encumbrance on any of the properties or assets
of Parent or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any material mortgage,
Contract, permit, franchise or other obligation to which Parent or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its subsidiaries or its
or any of their respective properties are bound or affected, except in the
case of clause (ii) or (iii), to the extent such conflict, violation, breach,
default, impairment or other effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, require Parent to obtain or make any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity except (i) pursuant to   20   applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws,
the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act and of foreign
governmental entities and the rules and regulations thereunder, the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq, and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by Delaware Law and (ii) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, (A) prevent
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
performing their respective material obligations under this Agreement or (B)
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   3.6
SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) Parent has made available to
Company (through reference to documents filed by EDGAR or otherwise) a
correct and complete copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and definitive proxy statement filed by Parent with the SEC since December
31, 1999 (the "Parent SEC Reports"), which are all the forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC since December 31,
1999. The Parent SEC Reports (A) were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (B) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of Parent\'s subsidiaries is required to file any
reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each set of consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Parent SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto and except that unaudited statements do not
contain footnotes in substance or form required by GAAP, as is permitted by
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and each fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries
at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to
normal adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in
amount.   (c) Parent has previously furnished to Company a complete and
correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been
filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by Parent with
the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.   3.7 No
Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required
to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to
the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results
of operations or financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole, except (i) liabilities disclosed or provided for in Parent\'s
unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2000 as set forth in the Parent SEC
Reports or in the related notes or (ii) liabilities incurred since March 31,
2000 in the ordinary course of business.   3.8 Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Since March 31, 2000, there has not been: (i) any Material Adverse
Effect on Parent; (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in
respect of, any of Parent\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' capital stock, or
any purchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent of any of Parent\'s
capital stock or any other securities of Parent or its subsidiaries or any
options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other
securities except for repurchases from employees following their termination
pursuant to the terms of their pre-existing stock option or purchase
agreements, (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any
of Parent\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' capital stock, (iv) any material
change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or practices, except
as required by concurrent changes in GAAP, or (v) any material revaluation by
Parent of   21   any of its assets, including, without limitation,
writing down the value of capitalized inventory or writing off notes or
accounts receivable or any sale of assets of the Parent other than in the
ordinary course of business.   3.9 Absence of Litigation. As of the date
hereof, there are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings that have a
reasonable likelihood of success on the merits pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened against, relating to or affecting Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, before any court, governmental department, commission, agency,
instrumentality or authority, or any arbitrator that seek to restrain or
enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
that could otherwise reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   3.10 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in: (i) the
S-4 will, at the time the S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the dates
mailed to the stockholders of Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The S-4 will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.  
3.11 Pooling of Interests. To its knowledge, based on consultation with
its independent accountants, neither Parent nor any of its directors,
officers or affiliates has taken any action which would interfere with
Parent\'s ability to account for the Merger as a pooling of interests.  
ARTICLE IV   Conduct Prior to the Effective Time   4.1 Conduct of Business
by Company. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms
or the Effective Time, Company and each of its subsidiaries shall, except (i)

substantially the same manner as heretofore conducted and in substantial
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, pay its debts and taxes
when due subject to good faith disputes over such debts or taxes, pay or
perform other material obligations when due subject to good faith disputes
over such obligations, and use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent

5.1 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement; Other Filings;
Board Recommendations.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Company and Parent will prepare, and file with the SEC,
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent will prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4 in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a
prospectus. Each of Parent and Company shall provide promptly to the other
such information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs
as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be
required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
the S-4, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and cause its counsel
and auditors to cooperate with the other\'s counsel and auditors in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4. Each of Company
and Parent will respond to any comments of the SEC, and will use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and
Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its
stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC. Each of the parties hereto shall cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 to comply as to form and substance as to
such party in all material respects with the applicable requirements of (i)
the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act, and (iii) the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, each of Company and Parent will prepare and file any other filings
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any
other Federal, foreign or Blue Sky or related laws relating to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all
regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified under the securities law
of every jurisdiction in the United States in which any registered holder of
Company Common Stock has an address of record on the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting; provided that Parent shall not be required to
consent to the service of process in any jurisdiction in which it is not so
subject. Each of Company and Parent will notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials of the receipt of notice that the S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC or its staff or any
other government officials for amendments or supplements to the S-4, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing or for additional information
and, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Legal Requirement, will supply the other with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
respect to the S-4, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any Other
Filing. Each of Company and Parent will cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under
this Section 5.1(a) to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Whenever Company or Parent becomes aware of any event which is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the S-4 or any Other Filing, Company or Parent, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other of such event and cooperate in filing with the SEC
or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of Company, such amendment or supplement.   (b) The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will include (i) the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Company to Company\'s stockholders that they vote in favor of
adoption of this Agreement, subject to the right of the Board of Directors of
Company to withhold, withdraw, modify, change or refrain from making its
recommendation in compliance with Section 5.2(c) and (ii) the opinion of
Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated referred to in Section 2.19.   25   
5.2 Meeting of Company Stockholders.   (a) Company will take all action
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the Company Charter Documents
to convene the Company Stockholders\' Meeting to be held as promptly as
practicable after the declaration of the effectiveness of the S-4 for the
purpose of enabling Company\'s stockholders to vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement. Unless the Board of Directors of Company shall have withheld,
withdrawn, modified, amended, changed or refrained from making its
recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in compliance with
Section 5.2(c), Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by
the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to facilitate
the providing of any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to Company\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on
the adoption of this Agreement, or (ii) if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting.
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by
Company in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited,
in compliance with Delaware Law, the Company Charter Documents, the rules of
Nasdaq and all other applicable legal requirements. Company\'s obligation to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting in
accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any change in the Board of Directors\'
recommendation regarding the Merger or any other determination subsequent to
the date hereof by Company\'s Board of Directors that it can no longer make
such recommendation.   (b) Unless the Board of Directors of Company shall
have withheld, withdrawn, modified, amended, changed or refrained from making
its recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in compliance
with Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors of Company shall recommend
that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of
Company has recommended that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; and (iii)
neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw, modify, amend, change or refrain from making, or resolve
to withhold, withdraw or refrain from making, or modify, amend or change, in
a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Company that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of Company from withholding, withdrawing, modifying, amending,
changing or refraining from making ("Changing") its recommendation in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement if (i) neither Company nor any of its
representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
Section 5.4 prior to and in connection with the proposed Changing of its
recommendation and (ii) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the Changing
of such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of
Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Company\'s stockholders
under applicable law; provided, however, that prior to publicly Changing such
recommendation, Company shall have given Parent at least forty-eight (48)
hours written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members
of Company\'s Board of Directors) and the opportunity to meet with Company
and its counsel. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall limit Company\'s
obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (regardless
of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company shall have
been withdrawn, amended or modified).   26    5.3 Confidentiality; Access
to Information.   (a) Confidentiality Agreement. The parties acknowledge
that Company and Parent have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of June 28, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.   (b) Access to Information. Company will afford
Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books, records and personnel of Company during the period prior
to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel of Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger.   5.4 No Solicitation.   (a) From and after the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its subsidiaries will not, nor
will they authorize or permit any of their respective officers or directors
or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative
retained by any of them to, nor will they authorize any of their respective
employees or affiliates to, nor will they fail to take reasonable measures to
cause their respective employees not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit
or initiate or knowingly encourage or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or knowingly take any other action
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal without complying with
Section 5.2(c) or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or
any contract, agreement or commitment providing for any
Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided, however, that this
Agreement shall not prohibit Company or any of its officers, directors,
affiliates, employees, investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or
representatives from (A) at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement
by Company\'s stockholders, furnishing information regarding Company to,
entering into a confidentiality agreement with, entering into discussions or
negotiations with, or entering into a definitive acquisition agreement with
any person or group in response to a Superior Offer submitted by such person
or group (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither Company nor any representative of
Company and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.4 prior to and in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is
required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, (3)
(x) at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to furnishing any such information
to, entering into a confidentiality agreement with or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, Company gives Parent
written notice of the identity of such person or group and of Company\'s
intention to take such action and (y) Company receives from such person or
group an executed agreement with confidentiality provisions at least as
restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement, and (4) contemporaneously
with furnishing any such information to such person or group, Company
furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by Company to Parent) or (B) complying with Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or furnishing a copy
or excerpts of this Agreement (excluding, however, the Company Schedule and
the Parent Schedule) to any person. Company and its subsidiaries will
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. In addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i) provide
Parent with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice (or such lesser
prior notice as provided to the members of Company\'s Board of Directors) of
any meeting of Company\'s Board of Directors at which Company\'s Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior Offer and (ii)
provide Parent with at least two (2) business days prior written notice (or
such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of Company\'s Board of
Directors)   27   of a meeting of Company\'s Board of Directors at which
Company\'s Board of Directors is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior
Offer to its stockholders and together with such notice a copy of any
definitive documentation relating to such Superior Offer.   "Superior
Offer" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not received in
violation of Section 5.4 for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock on terms that the Board of Directors of
Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account
all the known terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, are more
favorable to Company\'s stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided,
however, that any such Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to be a
"Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal is not committed and is not likely
in the judgment of Company\'s Board of Directors to be obtained by the entity
making such Acquisition Proposal on a timely basis. The parties agree that an
Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded from being deemed a "Superior
Offer" solely as a result of such Acquisition Proposal being conditioned upon
the completion of due diligence. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by Parent or any of its affiliates) contemplating any Acquisition
Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall
mean any transaction or series of related transactions other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that constitutes: (A) an
acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting
securities of Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of Company or any merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold, directly or indirectly,
less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or in any parent entity immediately following such
transaction; (B) a sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 25% of the assets of
Company; or (C) a liquidation or dissolution of Company having similar effect
to the foregoing.   (b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth
in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4, Company shall notify Parent orally and
in writing of (i) (A) any request received by Company for information which
Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) any
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) any inquiry received by Company with respect to,
or which Company reasonably believes would lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, and (iii) the identity of the person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, such written and oral notice to be
provided as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one (1) business
day after any of Company\'s officers, directors, investment bankers,
attorneys or other advisors or representatives become aware of the receipt by
Company of any request, proposal or inquiry described in clause (i). Company
will take reasonable measures to cause its employees to notify its officers
when any such employee becomes aware of the receipt by Company of any
request, proposal or inquiry described in clause (i). Company will keep
Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including
material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry.   5.5 Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will
consult with each other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
the Merger, this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or Nasdaq, in which case reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party will be made prior to such release or public
statement; provided, however, that no such consultation or agreement shall be
required if, prior to the date of such release or public statement, Company
shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified, amended, changed or refrained from
making its recommendation in favor of the adoption of this  
28   Agreement in compliance with Section 5.2. The parties have agreed to
the text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this
Agreement.   5.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification.   (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) causing the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied; (ii) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities;
(iii) making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any);
(iv) avoiding any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity challenging the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; (v) obtaining all consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement; (vi) defending any suits,
claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed; and (vii) executing or delivering any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, subject to the other terms and
conditions hereof, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts and take all commercially
reasonable acts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent
or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture
by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material limitation on
the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock.   (b) Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate, or of any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, where the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied as a
result thereof; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.  
(c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent or
Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in each case, where the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as a result thereof; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement.   5.7 Third Party Consents. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, Parent and Company will each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals
under any of its or its subsidiaries\' respective agreements, contracts,
licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   29    5.8 Stock
Options; ESPP; Warrants and Employee Benefits.   (a) Stock Options. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under the Company Option Plans,
whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company Stock Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the
acceleration of vesting on certain transactions, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except that (i) each Company Stock Option
will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms)
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall comply
with the terms of all such Company Stock Options and use its best efforts to
ensure, to the extent required by and subject to the provisions of, the
Company Option Plans, and to the extent permitted under the Code, that any
Company Stock Options that qualified for tax treatment as incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to
so qualify after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all corporate actions
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Stock Options on
the terms set forth in this Section 5.8(a).   (b) ESPP. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume the ESPP, and all outstanding rights to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP ("Purchase Rights") shall be
converted (in accordance with the Exchange Ratio) into rights to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock (with the number of shares rounded down to the
nearest whole share and the purchase price as of the offering date for each
offering period in effect as of the Effective Time rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). All such converted Purchase Rights shall be assumed by Parent,
and each offering period in effect under the ESPP immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be continued in accordance with the terms of the ESPP
until the end of such offering period. The ESPP shall terminate with the
exercise of the last assumed Purchase Right, and no additional Purchase
Rights shall be granted under the ESPP following the Effective Time, provided
that references to Company in the ESPP and related documents shall mean
Parent (except that the purchase price as of the offering date for a relevant
period shall be determined with respect to the fair market value of Company
Common Stock on such date, as adjusted hereby). Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of Purchase
Rights under the ESPP assumed in accordance with this Section 5.8(b). Parent
agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, Company\'s employees may
participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the
"Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, and
that service with Company shall be treated as service with Parent for
determining eligibility of Company\'s employees under the Parent ESPP.  
(c) Warrants. At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Warrant") shall be
assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that (i) each Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Warrant will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common   30   Stock at which such Company Warrant was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. Parent shall comply with the terms of all such
Company Warrants. Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Warrants on the terms set forth in
this Section 5.8(c).   (d) 401(k). Company shall terminate, effective as of
the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans

Company prior to the Effective Time that any such 401(k) plan shall not be
terminated. Parent shall receive from Company evidence that Company\'s
plan(s) and / or program(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of
Company\'s Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent), effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Company employees shall
be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent no later than

Time.   (e) Benefits; Prior Service. From and after the Effective Time,
Company employees shall be provided with employee benefits that are the same

including as to their location of employment. Parent shall cause employees of
Company and its subsidiaries to be credited with service with Company and
each of its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting under each
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time to the extent of their service with Company; provided,
however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in duplication of benefits.   5.9 Form S-8. Parent
agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options as soon
as is reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days
after the Effective Time.   5.10 Indemnification.   (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of Company (or any predecessor
corporation) pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement currently in
effect between Company and each person who is or was a director or officer of
Company (or any predecessor corporation) prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") and (ii) any indemnification provision under
the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party or of individuals who, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, were employees or agents of Company, unless such
modification is required by law.   (b) For a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
in effect, to the extent available, directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms equivalent in
all material respects to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of Company; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of 150% of the amount of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for such coverage and
provided, further, that if the annual premium payable for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for an annual premium not exceeding such
amount.   (c) In the event Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or   31   entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers a
material amount of its properties and assets to any person in a single
transaction or a series of transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent
will either guarantee or otherwise remain liable for the indemnification
obligations referred to in this Section 5.10 or will make or cause to be made
proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification
obligations described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.  
(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Party may have
by contract or otherwise.   5.11 Affiliate Agreement.   (a) Set forth in

information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for purposes
of reviewing such list. Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, on or as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, from each Company Affiliate that has

entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any
Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company Affiliate pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms
of the Company Affiliate Agreement entered into by such Company
Affiliate.   (b) Set forth in Section 5.11 of the Parent Schedule is a list
of those persons who may be deemed to be, in Parent\'s reasonable judgment,
affiliates of Parent within the meaning of Opinion 16 of the Accounting
Principles Board and applicable SEC rules and regulations (each, a "Parent
Affiliate"). Parent will provide Company with such information and documents
as Company reasonably requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Parent
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide a copy to
Company, on or as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, from
each Parent Affiliate, an executed Parent Affiliate Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-2 (the "Parent Affiliate
Agreements"). Each Parent Affiliate Agreement will be in full force and

supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by the
FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any
other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any
divestiture by Parent or Company or any of Parent\'s subsidiaries or
affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property

Effect qualifier shall be inapplicable with respect to representations and
warranties contained in Sections 2.4, 2.19, 2.20, 2.21, 2.27 and 2.28 (which

business combination for which the "pooling-of-interest" method of accounting
is used and (ii) from Deloitte and Touche LLP, independent accountants for
Parent, a copy of a letter addressed to Parent dated as of the Closing Date

Company or Parent, respectively, of this Agreement;   (e) by Company, upon a
breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this

not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate, provided, that

termination becoming effective pursuant hereto);   (g) by Parent if a
Triggering Event (as defined below) shall have occurred.   For the purposes

termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in this
Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8 (General Provisions), each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for any intentional or willful breach
of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance

forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is

all fees and expenses, other than attorneys\' and accountants fees and
expenses, incurred in connection with the printing and filing (with the SEC)

shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds, within one (1) business
day after demand by Parent, an amount equal to $65,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee") if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g);
provided, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to 7.1(g) as a result of a "Triggering Event" specified in clause

if Parent shall have terminated this Agreement more than ten (10) business
days after the Company shall have notified Parent of the breach of Section
5.4 hereof to which such Triggering Event relates.   (ii) If (A) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company, as applicable, pursuant to
Section 7.1(d), (B) prior to such termination a third party shall have
publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal, (C) such Acquisition Proposal

immediately available funds at or prior to the consummation of such
Company Acquisition an amount equal to the Termination Fee.   (iii) Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a final judgment against
Company no longer subject to appeal for the amounts set forth in this Section
7.3(b), Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b)
at the prime rate of Bank of America N.T. and S.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this
Section 7.3(b) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of
willful breach of this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Company Acquisition" shall mean any of the following transactions (other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately
preceding such transaction do not hold (directly or indirectly) at least 60%
of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or a parent entity following such transaction, (ii) a sale
or other disposition by Company of assets representing in excess of 60% of

indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of 60% of the voting power of the
then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company.   7.4 Amendment.

of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.   37    ARTICLE VIII   General
Provisions   8.1 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to
