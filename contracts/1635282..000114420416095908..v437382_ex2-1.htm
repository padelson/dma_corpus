(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of Common Stock, (i) each share (a " _Common
Share_ ") of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock, if any, held in the
treasury of the Company, which treasury shares shall be canceled as part of
the Merger, which treasury shares shall not constitute "Common Shares"

the Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ (all
such Time-Based Options and Performance-Based Options, collectively, the "
_Canceled Options_ ") and (iv) each SAR that is unexercised and outstanding
as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall thereupon be
canceled and converted into and become the right to the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions to effect the treatment of Options and SARs
set forth in this _Section 3.1_.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of

(c) Subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section 3.4_ , the "
_Merger Consideration_ " shall consist of (A) $500,000,000.00,  _less_ (B)
Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_ (C) the Estimated Closing Date
Cash, _less_ (D) the Estimated Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses
_plus_ (E) the SAT Bond Collateral _less_ (F) $1,250,000, apportioned
between cash and Acquiror Common Shares in the following manner: (x) a number
of Acquiror Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
product of 0.25 and the Merger Consideration _by_ (ii) $10.00 (the "
_Aggregate Stock Consideration_ "), and (y) cash in an amount equal to the
product of 0.75 and the Merger Consideration (the " _Aggregate Cash
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the Pre-
Closing Holders as follows:

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) Each Pre-Closing Holder of SARs shall be entitled to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration, in cash, equal to (i) the product of (x)
the Merger Consideration Per Fully-Diluted Common Share _multiplied_ _by_ (y)
the aggregate number of SARs held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _minus_ (ii) the sum of the Grant Prices for all of the SARs
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time (the aggregate
amount to be paid to the Pre-Closing Holders of SARs, the " _Aggregate SARs
Obligation_ ").

  



  

(ii) Each Pre-Closing Holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (x) the
Merger Consideration Per Fully-Diluted Common Share (as defined below),
multiplied by (y) the number of Common Shares held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Such Merger Consideration shall be apportioned
between cash and Acquiror Common Shares in proportion to the amount equal to
the difference between Aggregate Cash Consideration _minus_ the Aggregate SARs
Obligation bears to the Aggregate Stock Consideration Dollar Value.

  



  

(iii) Each Pre-Closing Holder of Canceled Options shall be entitled
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (i) the product of
(x) the Merger Consideration Per Fully-Diluted Common Share, _multiplied_ _by_
(y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise in
full of all Canceled Options held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time,  _minus_ (ii) the sum of the cash exercise prices payable
upon exercise of all Canceled Options held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Such Merger Consideration shall be apportioned between
cash and Acquiror Common Shares in proportion to the amount equal to the
difference between Aggregate Cash Consideration _minus_ the Aggregate SARs
Obligation bears to the Aggregate Stock Consideration Dollar Value.

  



  

For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Merger Consideration Per Fully-Diluted
Common Share_ " shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration, plus
(B) the Aggregate Option Exercise Price, plus (C) the Aggregate SAR Grant
Price, _divided_   _by_ (ii) the sum of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common
Shares and the Aggregate SARs. For the purposes of the foregoing, the "
_Aggregate Option Exercise Price_ " shall be the sum total of all cash
exercise prices of all Canceled Options outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the purposes of the foregoing,
the " _Aggregate SAR Grant Price_ " shall be the sum total of all Grant
Prices of all SARs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the Common
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ , and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Acquiror. In lieu of any fractional shares, Acquiror shall
pay each Pre-Closing Holder entitled to any portion of Acquiror Common Stock,
and such holder shall be entitled to receive, an amount in cash, rounded up
to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
Common Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the closing price on the NASDAQ Capital Market (" _NASDAQ_
") for an Acquiror Common Share on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Time.

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Adjustment to Aggregate Stock Consideration_. The Aggregate
Stock Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Acquiror Common
Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of
Acquiror Common Shares outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time so as to provide the holders of Common Shares with the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event and
as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Aggregate
Stock Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(i) _Deposit with Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with an exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror, (1) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the
Aggregate Stock Consideration and (2) a portion of the Aggregate Cash
Consideration _minus_ (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, _minus_ (ii) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, _minus_ (iii) the Holder Allocable Amount (the
cash so deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this clause (2), the "
_Funding Amount_ ").

  



  

(ii) _Deposit with Escrow Agent_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the Escrow Agent a portion of the
Aggregate Cash Consideration equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
_plus_ (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) After the Effective Time, each Pre-Closing Holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates for Common Shares (collectively,
the " _Certificates_ ") upon surrender of such Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and each Pre-Closing Holder of Canceled Options, upon delivery of a
Holder Acknowledgment to the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to receive from
the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor (subject to the provisions of
_Section 3.4_ ) such portion of the Merger Consideration into which such
holder's Common Shares and/or Canceled Options and/or SARs shall have been
converted as a result of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
payment with respect to Canceled Options and/or SARs held by current or former
employees of the Company or its Affiliates (" _Employee Options_ ") shall be
reduced by the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable
Law with respect to such payments and amounts so withheld shall be paid by
the Exchange Agent to the Company for disbursement to the applicable
Governmental Authority; and _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) a portion of the
Merger Consideration that is payable in cash to each Pre-Closing Holder of
Common Shares and/or Canceled Options and/or SARs equal to the product of the
sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount
_multiplied_ _by_ such holder's Applicable Percentage (and, solely in the
case of each Pre-Closing Holder of SARs, _further_ _multiplied_ _by_ 0.75)
shall be held in escrow in accordance with _Section 3.4(d)_ and the Escrow
Agreement and (2) a portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in
cash to each Pre-Closing Holder of Common Shares and/or Canceled Options
and/or SARs equal to the product of the Holder Allocable Expenses
_multiplied_ _by_ such holder's Applicable Percentage (and, solely in the case
of each Pre-Closing Holder of SARs, _further_ _multiplied_ _by_ 0.75) shall
be paid by Acquiror to the Holder Representative at Closing in accordance
with _Section 3.5_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Pre-
Closing Holder delivers the Certificate(s) representing such Common Shares,
or any Pre-Closing Holder of Canceled Options delivers a Holder
Acknowledgement with respect to such holder's Canceled Options, to Acquiror
at the Closing, Acquiror shall pay the amount which such holder is entitled
in consideration therefor directly to such holder at the Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and the Funding Amount payable to the
Exchange Agent shall be reduced by such amounts (subject, in the case of any
Employee Options, to withholding for Taxes, which amounts shall be paid to
the Company for disbursement to the applicable Governmental
Authority). Pending such surrender and exchange of a Pre-Closing Holder's
Certificate(s) (or, in the case of a Pre-Closing Holder of Canceled Options,
such delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment), a holder's Certificate(s) and any
documents evidencing a holder's Canceled Options shall be deemed for all
purposes to evidence such holder's right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such Common Shares or Canceled Options shall have
been converted by the Merger.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Estimated Closing Amounts_ Not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no event more than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Acquiror a written statement signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company setting forth (a) its good faith estimate of (i) Closing Date Net
Working Capital (" _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), prepared
in accordance with the NWC Methodology, (ii) Closing Date Indebtedness ("

Section 3.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date,
and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days thereof, Acquiror
shall prepare and deliver to the Holder Representative (i) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital ("
_Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), prepared in accordance with the NWC
Methodology, (iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all
Indebtedness of the Company (" _Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (iv) a
calculation of Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company (" _Closing Date
Cash_ "), and (v) a calculation of unpaid and accrued Transaction Expenses ("
_Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case, calculated as of
the close of business on the Closing Date consistent (except as provided in
this _Section 3.4(a)_ ) with the Closing Balance Sheet without giving effect
to the consummation of the Merger or any financing transactions in connection
therewith or, after the Effective Time, any other action or omission by
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is not in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the principles
applied in connection with the preparation of the most recent audited balance
sheet included in the Financial Statements (the " _Reference Balance Sheet_
");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) except as set forth in clause (y), the
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the same accounting practices,
policies, judgments and methodologies used in the preparation of the Reference
Balance Sheet and (y) the Closing Balance Sheet shall reflect no changes in
reserves (regardless of whether any such reserve is recorded as an offset to
a current asset's carrying value or is included as an accrued liability in the
Closing Balance Sheet) from amounts contained in the Reference Balance Sheet,
other than changes therein attributable to changes in facts and circumstances
occurring after the date of the Reference Balance Sheet. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall provide the Holder Representative and its
representatives access to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Holder Representative in connection with
its review of the Closing Balance Sheet. For the purpose of determining
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the consolidated current assets and current
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exclude the value of
all Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation
of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date
Cash and/or Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses, it shall notify Acquiror
of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after its
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the Holder
Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such
forty-five (45)-day period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date
Unpaid Transaction Expenses delivered by Acquiror, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and the Holder
Representative shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any such
disagreements specified in such notice. If, at the end of such period,
they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then KPMG LLP (or such
independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Acquiror and the Holder
Representative) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. Each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall promptly
provide their assertions regarding such disagreements in writing to the
Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its
determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than ninety
(90) days following the day on which any such disagreements are referred to
the Auditor). The Auditor shall base its determination solely on (i) the
written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an independent
investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and/or Closing
Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses require adjustment (only with respect to the
remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) in order to be
determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in _Section 3.4(a)_ ). The determination of the
Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on
which Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing
Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses are finally determined
in accordance with this  _Section 3.4(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_." All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne pro rata
as between Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative as a
Holder Allocable Expense, on the other, in proportion to the allocation of the
dollar value of the amounts in dispute between Acquiror and the Holder
Representative made by the Auditor such that the party prevailing on the
greater dollar value of such disputes pays the lesser proportion of such fees
and expenses.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
shall mean (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_ ), _minus_ Target Closing Date Net Working
Capital, _plus_  (ii) Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _minus_ Closing
Date Indebtedness (as finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_
), _plus_ (iii) Closing Date Cash (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.4(b)_ ), _minus_  Estimated Closing Date Cash, _plus_ (iv)
Estimated Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses, _minus_ Closing Date
Unpaid Transaction Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.4(b)_ ). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the
Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount, and
if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section
3.4(d)_.

  



  

(d) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ a portion of the Aggregate Cash Consideration equal to the
Adjustment Escrow Amount to Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of an Escrow Agreement. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (x) Acquiror shall
pay to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) such holder's
Fully-Diluted Percentage, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (
_provided_ that any incremental Transaction Expenses payable as a result of
such payment to the holders shall first be deducted from the
Adjustment Amount and promptly paid by Acquiror to the payee(s) of such
Transaction Expenses), less any applicable withholding, and (y) the Escrow
Agent shall pay to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the
Adjustment Escrow Funds ( _provided_ that any incremental Transaction
Expenses payable as a result of such payment to the holders shall first be
deducted from the Adjustment Escrow Funds and paid by the Escrow Agent to
Acquiror and promptly thereafter paid by Acquiror to the payee(s) of such
Transaction Expenses), _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such holder's Applicable
Percentage, less any applicable withholding. If the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number (the absolute value of such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "),
then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (x) the Escrow Agent shall pay
to Acquiror an amount equal to (A) the Deficit Amount, _multiplied_ _by_ (B)
the sum of the Fully-Diluted Percentages of all Pre-Closing Holders, and (y)
if any of the Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after such payment to Acquiror,
the Escrow Agent shall pay to each Pre-Closing Holder an amount in cash equal
to (i) the balance of the Adjustment Escrow Funds ( _provided_  that any
incremental Transaction Expenses payable as a result of such payment to the
holders shall first be deducted from such Adjustment Escrow Funds and paid by
the Escrow Agent to Acquiror and promptly thereafter paid by Acquiror to the
payee(s) of such Transaction Expenses), _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such holder's
Applicable Percentage, less any applicable withholding. Upon determination of
the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_ and _Section 3.4(c)_ , each
of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
the Adjustment Escrow Funds in accordance with this _Section 3.4(d)_. In no
event shall the Holder Representative or any Pre-Closing Holder have any
liability under this _Section 3.4_ in excess of such holder's allocable share
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds. In the event that Acquiror is entitled to
payment pursuant to this _Section 3.4(d)_ in an amount in excess of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds (such excess, the " _Adjustment Overage Amount_ "),
Acquiror shall be entitled to payment of, and the Escrow Agent shall pay
(concurrent with the payment of the Adjustment Escrow Funds), the Adjustment
Overage Amount, from and to the extent of the Indemnification Escrow Funds.
In no event shall Acquiror be entitled to payment pursuant to this _Section
3.4(d)_  of any amount in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Funds _plus_ the
Indemnification Escrow Funds.

Section 3.5 _Holder Allocable Expenses_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, the Holder Representative shall provide to Acquiror a written
estimate not to exceed $1,000,000 (which estimate shall include such reserves
as the Holder Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for
any Holder Allocable Expenses that are not then known or determinable) of the
aggregate amount of the fees and expenses incurred, or that may in the future
be incurred, by the Holder Representative in its capacity as such (the "
_Holder Allocable Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date, a portion of the
Aggregate Cash Consideration in the amount of such estimated Holder Allocable
Expenses shall be deposited in the account designated by the Holder
Representative no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing.
Whether or not deposited on or prior to the Closing Date, no amount shall be
included on the Closing Balance Sheet with respect to liabilities for the
Holder Allocable Expenses. Any excess Holder Allocable Expenses not used by

of business, in each case, at such time as may be necessary to permit the
lawful consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on or prior to
the End Date. The entry by any Governmental Authority in any Action of
a Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby but requiring any of the assets or lines of business of
Acquiror to be sold, licensed or otherwise disposed or held separate
thereafter (including the business and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified
in _Article IX_.

  



  

(d) Acquiror shall promptly furnish to the Company and the Holder
Representative copies of any notices or written communications received
by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Acquiror shall permit counsel to the Company an opportunity to review in
advance, and Acquiror shall consider in good faith the views of such counsel
in connection with, any proposed written communications by Acquiror and/or its
Affiliates to any Governmental Authority concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror agrees to provide the Company, the
Holder Representative and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance
notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in
person or by telephone, between Acquiror and/or any of its Affiliates, agents
or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, concerning or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Acquiror shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees
(whether or not such fees may be the obligation of the Company under
applicable Law) payable to the Antitrust Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.2 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that it shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _D andO Indemnitees_") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would
have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law). Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of six years from and
after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any successor thereof to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of present and former directors
and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods at or
prior to the Closing Date than are set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Company as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain prepaid
"tail" policies reasonably acceptable to Acquiror extending coverage for an
aggregate period of six (6) years providing directors' and officers' liability
insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time covering those Persons who are currently
covered by the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore provided to Acquiror or its agents or representatives);
_provided_   _however_ that the amount paid for such prepaid policies
pursuant to this sentence shall not exceed the annual equivalent of two
hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premiums paid by the Company in
its last full fiscal year without the prior written consent of Acquiror, and
_provided_ _further_ that any such amount paid prior to the Effective Time
shall be credited in the calculation of Closing Date Cash.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.2_.

Section 7.3 _Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a) On the Closing Date, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries remain the employees of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries (" _Continuing Employees_ ") and for a period of one year
following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Company to provide each
Continuing Employee with severance benefits and protections that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits and protections that were provided to
such Continuing Employee under an applicable Company Benefit Plan in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. This _Section 7.3_ shall not limit the obligation
of the Company to maintain any Company Benefit Plan that, pursuant to
an existing contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one year.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued
employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment
of any individual.

  



  

(b) Each employee and former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, for purposes of eligibility and vesting (and for
purposes of benefit accrual for severance and vacation only), be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under any employee
benefit plan of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries in which such employee may
participate after the Closing Date providing benefits similar to those
provided under any Company Benefit Plan to the same extent as such employee
or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under such Company Benefit Plan. With respect to the calendar year in
which Acquiror ceases to maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan, each
employee shall be given credit for amounts paid under such Company Benefit
Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Acquiror.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no provision of
this _Section 7.3_ shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to
amend, any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plan of Acquiror or any affiliate.

Section 7.4 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Acquiror and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, as
promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy
(or obtain the waiver of, if deemed advisable by Acquiror) on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Acquiror and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) in
the Debt Commitment Letter and within their control (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing),
(ii) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters until the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement are consummated, (iii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related flex
provisions) or on other terms that would not be prohibited by _Section 7.4(d)_
, and (iv) to the extent the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter are satisfied, consummate the Debt Financing at Closing.

  



  

(b) Acquiror shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any
material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Debt
Documents_ "), in each case, of which Acquiror or Merger Sub becomes aware,
(B) if and when Acquiror or Merger Sub becomes aware that any portion of the
Financing contemplated by any Commitment Letter may not be available to
consummate the Merger, (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Commitment Letter or other Debt Document or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter or other
Debt Document (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or Debt Documents),
and (D) if for any reason, any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including flex terms). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror and
Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status
of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, and shall, upon the Company's
reasonable request, provide to the Company copies of executed copies of the
definitive documents related to the Financing (excluding any unredacted fee
letters, engagement letters or other agreements that are confidential by their
terms);  _provided_ , that neither Acquiror, Merger Sub nor any of their
Affiliates shall be under obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege
is asserted in good faith.

  



  

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including flex terms), Acquiror and Merger Sub shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing, including from
alternative sources, in an amount sufficient (when added to the portion of the
Debt Financing that is available and other available funds) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event but no later than the Closing Date on terms not materially
less favorable from the standpoint of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Affiliates
of Acquiror and Merger Sub party thereto than those in the Debt Commitment
Letter (as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of Acquiror and
taking into account the flex provisions). All references to the Financing
shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing and all references to
the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Documents shall include the applicable
documents for the Alternative Financing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Acquiror and Merger Sub shall have the right from time to time to amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under,
the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt Documents, and/or substitute
other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing
from the same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Documents
shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (such that the
aggregate funds that would be available to Acquiror on the Closing Date would
not be sufficient to provide the funds required to be funded on the Closing
Date to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
(ii) add or expand the conditions precedent to the funding on the Closing
Date of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or
(iii) otherwise amend, modify or expand any condition to the receipt of any
portion of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (I) delay or prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of any portion of
the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion
of the Debt Financing) less likely to occur, (III) adversely affect the
ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby or enforce Acquiror's rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, or (IV) adversely affect the
ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub in any material respects to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Acquiror and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. All references to the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be deemed to include any new commitment letters
entered into in accordance with this _Section 7.4(d)_.

  



  

(e) Acquiror and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining
of the Debt Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to
Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the proposed transaction
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article IX_. 

  



  

(f) Acquiror and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Equity Commitment Letter and shall (i) maintain in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter until the Merger is consummated and (ii) enforce their
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 7.5 _NASDAQ Listing_. Prior to Effective Time, Acquiror
shall prepare and submit to NASDAQ a listing application, if required
under NASDAQ rules, covering the Acquiror Common Shares issuable in the
Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval for the
listing of such Acquiror Common Shares, subject to official notice of
issuance, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Acquiror with
respect to such listing.

  



  

Section 7.6 _No Solicitation by Acquiror_. From the date hereof
until the Closing Date or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article X_ , Acquiror and its Subsidiaries shall not, and
Acquiror shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives not to, (i) make any proposal or offer that constitutes a
Business Combination Proposal, (ii) initiate any discussions or negotiations
with any Person with respect to a Business Combination Proposal or (iii) enter
into any acquisition agreement, business combination, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or agreement in principle, or any other agreement relating to a
Business Combination Proposal _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 7.6 shall limit Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, or any of their
representatives, from taking any actions in connection with any Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal with any Person to the extent that such Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal would not (x) constitute a Business Combination
Proposal, (y) be consummated before the Effective Time or (z) would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or impair the consummation of the
Merger or the performance by Acquiror or Merger Sub of any of their
obligations hereunder. From and after the date hereof, Acquiror and its
officers and directors shall, and Acquiror shall instruct and cause
Acquiror's representatives, its Subsidiaries and their representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate all discussions and negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Business Combination Proposal.

Subsidiaries to, except as contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to
by Company in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,

interests of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, other than a redemption of
Acquiror Common Shares made as part of the Acquiror Share Redemption (as
defined below);

  



  

(c) incur or assume any Indebtedness or guarantee any Indebtedness
of another Person, issue or sell any debt securities or warrants or

subject only to such actions not being in violation of the fiduciary duties
of members of the Acquiror Board to Acquiror, Acquiror shall nominate
such individual in the Registration Statement; _provided_ that if Acquiror
avoids its obligations under this _Section 7.8_  because it deems such
nomination to be in violation of fiduciary duties of members of the Acquiror
Board, the Principal Stockholders shall be entitled to designate an
alternative nominee to serve as a director on the Acquiror Board. Acquiror
shall not take any action to remove the Nominee Director for a period of one
year, and shall include the name of the Nominee Director in any
solicitation of proxies for election of directors, except where W Capital

or the suspension of the qualification of the Acquiror Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or written threat of
any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for

Proposals_ "). Acquiror may only postpone or adjourn the Acquiror
Shareholders' Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of

Section 8.2 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any
covenant contained in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , Acquiror and
the Company shall each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries

and regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of
Acquiror, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain

optimizing the Company's capital structure, giving due regard to the Company's
ongoing operating and financial requirements after consultation with the
Company\'s management, and (d) take such other action as may reasonably be
necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy the
conditions of _Article IX_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to
consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
obligated to bear any material expense or pay any material fee or grant any
material concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations
or approvals required in order to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms
of any Contract (other than this Agreement and the agreements contemplated
hereby) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Escrow Agreement_. Each of the Company, the Holder
Representative, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to

and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed, in each case in a
manner consistent with past practices (except where otherwise required by
applicable Law), all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). Acquiror shall deliver all Pre-
Closing Tax Returns to the Holder Representative for its review and
comment within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns, provided that Pre-Closing Tax Returns relating to income
Taxes shall be delivered no later than thirty (30) days before the due date
for filing such Tax Returns. Acquiror shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments provided in writing by the Holder Representative to
Acquiror with respect to all such Pre-Closing Tax Returns and no such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns shall be filed without the prior written consent of the
Holder Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that
are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins on or before the
Closing Date and ends after Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
portion of such Taxes that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in
the case of ad valorem or property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, such as income, sales or use
Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (computed on an
interim closing of the books basis) as if the relevant Tax period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that any exemptions,
allowances, deductions (including depreciation or amortization) and credits
that are calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated between the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning
after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such
portion of the taxable period.

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes, fees and costs (including any
associated penalties and interest) (" ** _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be borne, fifty (50) percent by
Acquiror and fifty (50) percent by the Holder Representative and the Pre-
Closing Holders (which amount shall be included as Transaction Expenses).
Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Acquiror shall timely file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes. With respect to any such Transfer Taxes not included in the
final determination of the Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 3.4_
, the Holder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Acquiror out of the Indemnification Escrow Funds, at least ten (10) days
before the date on which such Tax Return is due, an amount equal to the
amount of Transfer Taxes owed by the Holder Representative and the Pre-
Closing Holders in connection with such Tax Return.

  



  

(d) Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably
cooperate, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Action
regarding Taxes of, or with respect to, Pre-Closing Tax Returns or Tax
Returns relating to a Straddle Period of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such Action and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided

qualification or exception relating to materiality, material adverse effect
or "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of

(ii) any breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any covenant or

representation or warranty Acquiror or Merger Sub has made in this Agreement
in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ (an "
_Acquiror Warranty Breach_ ") (provided that any qualification or exception
relating to materiality, material adverse effect or Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect shall be disregarded solely for purposes of determining the amount of

or warranty has been breached) or (ii) any breach by Acquiror or Merger Sub of
any covenant or agreement of Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party

written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a
final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by
any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree.
The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for

when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified
Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages
suffered by it.

Section 12.3 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

  



  

(a) If any Action is commenced or threatened that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by any Person
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the
Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing
in reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Action, (C) including the
Indemnified Party's best estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise
from such Action, and (D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the
Indemnified Party's Indemnification Claim under this Agreement. Failure to
notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) the defense of such Action is prejudiced by
the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified
Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_  prior to the Survival Expiration
Date.

  



  

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim
with counsel of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such
Action, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the
conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related
claims, counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with
the Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; _provided_
,  _however_ , that (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the reasonable
expense of the Indemnitor if (x) so requested by the Indemnitor in writing or
(y) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party,
representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor would create a
conflict of interest; _provided_ , that in any such circumstance the
Indemnitor shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim, and (2) the
Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor
of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor
notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within sixty
(60) days after such notice is given, (i) give notice to the Indemnified
Party of its election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject
to such Indemnification Claim and (ii) thereafter promptly assume such
defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such Action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such Indemnification Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) and (B) if at any time the Indemnitor acknowledges
in writing that such Action is a Damage subject to this _Article XII_ , the
Indemnitor may thereafter assume the defense of such Action.

(c) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that
may give rise to an Indemnification Claim for any matter not involving an
Action, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor
and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the circumstances giving rise to the
Indemnification Claim, (B) including the Indemnified Party's best estimate of
the amount of Damages that may arise from such circumstances, and (C)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's
Indemnification Claim under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor
in accordance with this _Section 12.3(c)_ will not relieve the Indemnitor of
any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent
(1) the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's
failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the
Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section
12.3(c)_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

  



  

(d) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which
the applicable Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted
during normal business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 12.3_ and _Section 8.4_ , _Section 8.4_ shall control with respect
to any Tax Claim.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (except for
any indemnification relating to Taxes, which shall not be subject to the
provisions of _Section 12.4(b)_ ), any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this _Article XII_ will be limited as follows:

  



  

(a) _Source and Order of Recovery_. If there is determined to be
any amount owing to an Acquiror Indemnified Party as a result of
indemnification under this _Article XII_ , the amount of then-remaining
Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be used by an Acquiror Indemnified Party
as the first recourse with respect to any and all amounts owed to an Acquiror
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XII_. However, if the amount of
then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds is insufficient to satisfy in full
any amount owing to an Acquiror Indemnified Party as a result of
indemnification under this _Article XII_ , then the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties shall seek recourse against the RandW Insurance Policy. At no time,
shall the Company or any Pre-Closing Holder have any liability to the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties for Damages under this Agreement in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, except solely in the case of any fraud;
_provided_ that in the event of fraud, (i) Damages shall first be paid out of
the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds and (ii) if the amount then
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Funds is insufficient to satisfy in
full any amount owing to an Acquiror Indemnified Party, then the Acquiror
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recourse directly against the Pre-
Closing Holders on a joint and several basis for the amount in excess of (x)
the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds _plus_ (y) only if such claim
for fraud is covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, the then remaining
RandW Insurance Coverage Amount.

(b) _Claims Basket_. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ with respect to
any Indemnification Claim made with respect to a Company Warranty Breach
(other than Company Warranty Breaches with respect to Fundamental
Representations) unless and until the amount of Damages (excluding costs and
expenses of Acquiror Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with making
such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
that are the subject of such claim exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per-Claim Basket_
"), and the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ with respect to Indemnification
Claims made with respect to Company Warranty Breaches (other than Company
Warranty Breaches with respect to Fundamental Representations) to the extent
the aggregate amount of all Damages (excluding costs and expenses of Acquiror
Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with making such claim under this
Agreement) incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
XII_ for all such Indemnification Claims (excluding amounts below the
applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds $500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "). Once
the Basket Amount is exceeded, if at all, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the extent both
(i) such Damages considered on a per-claim basis exceed the Per-Claim Basket,
and (ii) Damages in respect of all such Indemnification Claims that satisfy
clause (i) of this sentence exceed the Basket Amount. Other than with respect
to any claim or counterclaim for breach by Acquiror of any representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in _Article II_ or _Article III_ , the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article XII_ with respect to any Indemnification Claim made with
respect to an Acquiror Warranty Breach (other than Acquiror Warranty Breaches
with respect to Acquiror Fundamental Representations) unless and until the
amount of Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties that are the
subject of such claim exceeds the Per-Claim Basket, and the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XII_ with respect to Indemnification Claims made with respect to
Acquiror Warranty Breaches (other than Acquiror Warranty Breaches with respect
to Acquiror Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount
of all Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties for which the
Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XII_ for all such Indemnification Claims (excluding amounts below
the applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds the Basket Amount. Once the Basket
Amount is exceeded, if at all, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall only be
entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the extent both (i)
such Damages considered on a per-claim basis exceed the Per-Claim Basket, and
(ii) Damages in respect of all such Indemnification Claims that satisfy
clause (i) of this sentence exceed the Basket Amount.

  



  

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other
Third-Party Recoveries_. All Damages for which any Indemnified Party
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this Article XII shall
be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds, Tax benefits actually
realized by the Indemnified Party in the taxable year in which such
indemnification payment is made, indemnification payments and other third-
party recoveries which any Indemnified Party actually receives in respect of
any Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party, net of applicable reserves,
and deductibles, and reasonable internal or third party expenses actually
incurred in obtaining or receiving such recoveries. In the event any
Indemnified Party is entitled to any such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits,
indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of any Damages
for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XII, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or
recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are realized by an
Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any
indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or other third-
party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the
relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such
indemnification payment.

  



   

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XII_ , at the election of
the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of
its claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

  



  

(e) _Expenses_. In the event that the Holder Representative assumes
any defense of any Action for which an Acquiror Indemnified Party has
sought indemnification, reasonable expenses incurred by any Seller
Indemnified Party in connection therewith, including reasonable legal costs
and expenses, shall constitute Damages for purposes of determining the maximum
aggregate amount to which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
pursuant to _Section 12.4(a)_.

  



  

(f) _Consequential, Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any (i) special,
punitive or exemplary damages, (ii) any loss of enterprise value, diminution
in value of any business, damage to reputation or loss of goodwill, or (iii)
any lost profits, consequential, indirect or incidental damages.

  



  

(g) _Damages Reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet_. No
Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Damages in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved for on
the Closing Balance Sheet.

  



  

(h) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, recovers Damages in
respect of an Indemnification Claim, no other Acquiror Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, may recover the same Damages in
respect of an Indemnification Claim under this Agreement.

  



  

(i) _SAT Tax Claims_. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for any Damages arising out of, or relating to,
the SAT Tax Action.

  



  

Section 12.5 _Mitigation of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_.

  



  

Section 12.6 _Tax Treatment_. All amounts paid with respect to
Indemnification Claims under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

Section 12.7 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Following
the Closing, except in the case of fraud, indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and any
parties claiming by or through any party (including the Indemnified Parties)
related to or arising from any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement
(other than any (i) breach of any covenant or agreement contained in _Article
II_  or _Article III_ , (ii) breach of any post-Closing obligation under any
covenant that provides for performance following the Closing Date or (iii)
any claims made solely against the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy).

  



  

   

 | 83|

Section 12.8 _Release of Escrow_. The Escrow Agreement shall specify
that the Indemnification Escrow Funds (if any) shall be released to the Pre-
Closing Holders in accordance with such holders' relative Applicable
Percentages on the first Business Day following the Survival Expiration Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim pursuant to this _Article XII_
shall have been properly asserted by any Acquiror Indemnified Party in
accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the Survival Expiration Date
and remain pending on the Survival Expiration Date (any such claim, a "
_Pending Claim_ "), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds released to the Pre-
Closing Holders shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds then held
by the Escrow Agent,  _minus_ the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim and
(ii) any funds that remain in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date
in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to the Pre-Closing
Holders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with such
holders' relative Applicable Percentages promptly upon resolution or (if
applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim. In each case in which this
_Section 12.8_ provides for the release of Indemnification Escrow Funds, each
of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall promptly submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with this _Section 12.8_ and
the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.9 _R andW Insurance Policy_. The parties acknowledge that,
at or before Closing, Acquiror will take all action necessary to obtain and
bind the RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW Insurance Policy shall provide that the
insurer shall waive and not pursue any subrogation rights against any Pre-
Closing Holder (or any of its past, present or future directors, officers,
employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders, Affiliates,
agents, attorneys, advisors or representatives or Affiliates of any of the
foregoing);  _provided_ , that the insurer thereunder shall be entitled to
subrogate against any Pre-Closing Holder with respect to fraud on the part of
such Pre-Closing Holder.

  



  

Section 12.10 _SAT Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agree that (a) no representation, warranty or covenant is
made by the Company or any Principal Stockholder with respect to the SAT Tax
Action or any liabilities with respect thereto, and (b) no Acquiror
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any right or remedy (including any
indemnification under this Agreement, or any adjustment to the Merger
Consideration) for any Damages arising out of, or relating to, the SAT Tax
Action, and shall be deemed to have waived any such rights hereunder.

Article XIII 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 13.1 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Holder
Representative acknowledges that Acquiror is a blank check company with the
powers and privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the Company
and Holder Representative further acknowledges that, as described in the
prospectus dated May 19, 2015 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov,
substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds of
Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its securities
and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust
Account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public stockholders and
the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering. Each of the Company
and Holder Representative acknowledges that it has been advised by Acquiror
that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise tax,
income tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in
the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to Acquiror in limited amounts
from time to time in order to permit Acquiror to pay its operating expenses;
(ii) if Acquiror completes the transactions which constitute a Business
Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in the
Prospectus; and (iii) if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination
within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the
Trust Agreement, to Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the
costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's
public stockholders. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
each of the Company and Holder Representative, on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders, hereby irrevocable waives any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust
Account and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds
distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Acquiror; _provided_ that (x)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's and Holder
Representative's right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief
against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of
the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Acquiror
Share Redemptions) to the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Acquiror's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share
Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit any claims that the Company and Holder Representative may have in the
future against Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).

  



  

Section 13.2 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time
prior to the Closing, by action taken by its Board of Directors, or officers
thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or agree to an amendment or modification to this Agreement by an
agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not necessarily by the
same Persons) as this Agreement.

  



  

Section 13.3 _Notices_. All notices and other communications among
the parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
(i) when delivered in person, (ii) when delivered after posting in the United
States mail having been sent registered or certified mail return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, (iii) when delivered by FedEx or other nationally
recognized overnight delivery service, or (iv) when delivered by telecopy or

Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No
representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or
otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist

modified in whole or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing
executed in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to
this Agreement. The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company shall not restrict the ability of the Board of Directors of the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ or to
cause the Company to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 13.11 _ to the extent permitted under Section 251(d) of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections 7.4_ , _13.5_ ,  _13.7_ ,
_13.14_ , _13.16_ and this _Section 13.11_ (and related definitions in this

Section 13.12 _Publicity_.

  



  

(a) All press releases or other public communications relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of
the release for publication thereof, shall prior to the Closing be subject to
the prior mutual approval of Acquiror and the Company which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld by any party; _provided_ , that no party shall be
required to obtain consent pursuant to this _Section 13.12(a)_ to the extent
any proposed release or statement is substantially equivalent to the
information that has previously been made public without breach of the
obligation under this _Section 13.12(a)_.

  



  

(b) The restriction in _Section 13.12(a)_ shall not apply to the
extent the public announcement is required by applicable securities Law, any
Governmental Authority or stock exchange rule; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in such an event, the party making the announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party in advance as
to its form, content and timing. For the avoidance of doubt, disclosures
resulting from the parties' efforts to obtain approval or early
termination under the HSR Act and to make any relating filing shall be deemed
not to violate this Agreement.

  



  

Section 13.13 _Severability_.

  



  

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree that if any
provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable
in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any
actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid
and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent
necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid
and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the parties.

  



  

Section 13.14 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby must be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent such Court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware), or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the parties
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any
such proceeding or action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have
to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined
only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect
the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any
action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this _Section 13.14_.

  



  

(b) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which
may arise under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is
likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such
party hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and voluntarily waives any right
such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim, or third-party claim of any kind or description (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), against any Debt Financing Source
in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, Borough of Manhattan or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of New
York (and appellate courts thereof).

  



  

Section 13.15 _Enforcement_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage could occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek specific
enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event
that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law, and each party agrees to waiver any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection therewith.
Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to cause Acquiror to fully
enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters against the Sponsor and to
cause the equity financing thereunder to be funded, including by demanding
that Acquiror institute one or more actions, suits or proceedings against the
Sponsor to fully enforce the Sponsor's obligations thereunder and Acquiror's
and Merger Sub's rights thereunder.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, solely in the
event that (i) all conditions in _Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_ have been
satisfied or are capable of being satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing),
(ii) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has been funded or
would be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that (A) all
conditions in _Section 9.3_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) or
will be waived by the Company, (B) the Company is prepared to consummate the
Closing and the Merger and stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing and the Merger, and (C) if specific performance is granted and the
Financing is funded and the Company otherwise complies with its obligations
hereunder then the Closing will occur, the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance of Acquiror\'s obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and/or to consummate the Closing and the Merger.

Section 13.16 _Non-Recourse_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as parties hereto and any express guarantor of any
such party's obligations hereunder and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not relieve any party or Pre-
Closing Holder for liability with respect to fraud. Except to the extent a
named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not
otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Acquiror under
this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) None of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall assert any
claim against any Debt Financing Source with respect to matters based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Debt
Financing). The Company and its Affiliates hereby waive any and all claims and
causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Debt Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Debt
Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 13.16(b)_
shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Acquiror under
this Agreement or any Debt Financing Source's obligations to Acquiror under
the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(c) Except as explicitly provided in _Section 13.15(b)_ or in the
Equity Commitment Letter, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall
assert any claim against any Equity Financing Source with respect to matters
based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including the Equity Financing). Except as explicitly provided in _Section
13.15(b)_ or in the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company and its Affiliates
hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Equity
Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Equity Financing).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 13.16(c)_ shall in
any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Acquiror under this
Agreement or any Equity Financing Source's obligations to Acquiror under the
Equity Commitment Letter.
