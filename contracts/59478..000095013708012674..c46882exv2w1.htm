duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry
Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for

Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
