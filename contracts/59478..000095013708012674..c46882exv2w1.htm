AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than October 14, 2008) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to purchase all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote in the election of directors or upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or the Purchaser, waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. 

  

 (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or the Purchaser, waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_. In circumstances in which the stockholders of the Company do not have the right to seek remedies at law or equity, the obligations of Parent and the Purchaser under this Agreement are material to the CompanyÂ’s execution of this Agreement and any failure by Parent or the Purchaser to comply with the terms of this Agreement shall enable the Company to seek all remedies available at law or equity to it and on behalf of the stockholders. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including without limitation the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in Annex I in a manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares, or (vi) extend the Offer in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is the later of (i) 20 Business Days following the commencement of the Offer or (ii) 45 calendar days following the first public announcement of this Agreement by Parent (in either case, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, at the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

  

 (e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer (including without limitation the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by the Parent or the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to 20 Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer after the Company delivers or is required to deliver to Parent a notice with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that has been received by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or any Company Representative, in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_, except to the extent that prior to the expiration of the Offer the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Company Board has rejected the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice and, in each case, the Company Board has reconfirmed the Company Board Recommendation and the withdrawal or rejection of such Acquisition Proposal, and the reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, has been publicly announced by the Company. The " _Outside Date_ " shall be December 31, 2008 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ that if all of the conditions to the Offer (other than either or both of the HSR Condition or the Governmental Approval Condition, and regardless of whether the Minimum Condition is then satisfied) have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or the Purchaser, waived by Parent and the Purchaser, as of the Initial Outside Date, the Outside Date shall be March 31, 2009 (the " _Extended Outside Date_ "). In addition, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form Threshold (without regard to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option or Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". The Offer Documents shall provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.1(f)_. 

  

 (g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article 7_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination) terminate the Offer and shall not acquire the Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the registered holders thereof. 

  

 (h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

  

 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) If the Offer commences on or after Tuesday, October 14, 2008, contemporaneously with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and hereby represents that it has obtained all necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in such form as the Company Financial Advisor shall provide or approve in writing in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether Item 1015(b) is applicable). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation and a statement (in such form as the Company Financial Advisor shall provide or pre-approve in writing) to the effect that the Company Financial Advisor has given the Fairness Opinion which is included in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information (including, but not limited to, updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares, in connection with the preparation and dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation of tenders of Shares in the Offer. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with Parent and the Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or 

   ##### 

  

    

subject to any Company Stock Option Plan or other Company Benefit Plan, and to
permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. The Company
shall timely waive any provision of the Company Stockholder Agreement that
would prevent any holder of Shares bound thereby from tendering Shares in the
Offer, and shall take any other action under the Company Stockholder
Agreement, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit any
such holder to tender its Shares in the Offer without violating or causing
any breach or default under the Company Stockholder Agreement. 

  

 1.3 _Directors_.

 1.7 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 1.6_, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the Purchaser shall then hold of record, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption of this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_"), the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 1.8 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to up to the number of then available authorized and unissued Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares). Upon ParentÂ’s request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Purchaser may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery of an unsecured, non-negotiable and non-transferable promissory note, bearing simple interest at 3% per annum, with principal and interest due one year after the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, prepayable in whole or in part without premium or penalty (a " _Promissory Note_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Provided that no applicable law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part, only after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Each time that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, including without limitation at the PurchaserÂ’s option by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at the PurchaserÂ’s request or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by applicable Law. 

  

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation or Conversion of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, all Shares (if any) held by each Company Subsidiary shall remain outstanding and shall become that number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation as the number of Shares held by such Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and 

   ##### 

  

    

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a reputable national bank reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in treasury bills, treasury notes, treasury bonds, and treasury inflation protected securities, in each case, issued by the United States Department of the Treasury or other short-term (90 days) instruments that are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. 

  

 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time following the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures in  _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. If, prior to six years after the Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Shares has not complied with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration or Option Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Options, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or Options, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 2.4 _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock Units; Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) As of the Acceptance Time, each then outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any stock option plan of the Company, including without limitation the CompanyÂ’s 1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 1996 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, 1998 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, 2002 Stock Option Plan, 2005 Inducement Stock Option Plan and 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, or any other similar plan, agreement or arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall vest in full and become fully exercisable. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions that are commercially reasonable to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Options shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall pay the Option Payments to the former holders of Company Options as promptly as administratively practicable (and in any event no later than the second regular payroll date) after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, any such Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the 

   ##### 

  

    

former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of
the Option Payment, and the Company will take all action necessary, including
without limitation obtaining any required consents, to ensure that former
holders of Company Options will have no rights from and after the Effective
Time other than the right to receive the Option Payment from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with this _Section 2.4(a)_. If the exercise
price per Share with respect to any Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option will be canceled pursuant
to this _Section 2.4(a)_ without consideration. 

  

 (b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Acceptance Time, each unvested restricted stock unit awarded under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan or any other similar plan, agreement or arrangement (" _Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall vest in full and the Restricted Stock Unit shall be settled for Company Common Stock with the right to receive the Merger Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest, as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ , subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_. 

  

 (c) _Termination of Company Stock Option Plans_. After the Effective Time, all Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Restricted Stock Units or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. 

  

 2.5 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The current offerings in progress as of the date hereof under the CompanyÂ’s 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall continue, and the shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the date hereof as provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the ESPP. In accordance with the terms of the ESPP, any offering in progress as of the Effective Time shall be shortened, and the "Exercise Date" (as defined in the ESPP) shall be the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Each then outstanding option under the ESPP shall be exercised automatically on such Exercise Date. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of any shares of Company Common Stock under this provision shall be in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_. The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof amend the ESPP as appropriate to avoid the commencement of any new offering of options thereunder at or after the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as set forth in the publicly available Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Company SEC Document filed on or after the date hereof and excluding any disclosures set forth in any section of a Company SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or any other disclosures included in such filings that constitute general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and the Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to a particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any disclosure contained in any Section of the Company

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent (including without limitation pursuant to clause (ii) below), the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless substantially concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Breakup Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section 7.1(e)_ and _Section 7.2_; and _provided_ _further_  that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have breached this _Section 5.4_ and (B):

shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.4(d)_ with respect to such new
written notice.

Representatives to, during such three Business Day period, negotiate with

that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in

 5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

  

 (a) The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation the Offer and the Merger, (iii) if required pursuant to ISRA, file a General Information Notice with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the " _NJDEP_ ") within five days after the date hereof and (iv) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days after the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any of their respective fees due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings.

 (b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in connection with consummation of the Offer or the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.5(b)_, such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the consummation of the Offer or the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section 5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger.

announcement in advance of such issuance; _provided_ , that to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company shall be permitted to issue a press
release solely announcing the existence of any Acquisition
Proposal previously disclosed to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.4(c)_. The
Company, Parent and the Purchaser agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and
Parent.

 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Employees_ ") will participate effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;  _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan. 

  

 (c) No later than five Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a copy of any communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide an opportunity for Parent to make reasonable revisions thereto. 

  

 (d) The Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 5.8_ and in _Sections 3.12_ and _3.13_ with respect to Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Company Employees, former Company Employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or 

   ##### 

  

    

any of their respective affiliates. No provision of this _Section 5.8_ or
_Sections 3.12_ or  _3.13_ will constitute an amendment to any Company
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan, policy agreement
or arrangement of Purchaser or any of its affiliates. 

  

 5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) For a period of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and individuals who become such prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Law, provided, however, that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is determined by final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law. Any claims for indemnification or advancement made prior to the expiration of the six year period hereunder shall survive until the final resolution thereof. 

  

 (b) For a period of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s directors and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the CompanyÂ’s existing policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay (and Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that in 

   ##### 

  

    

the event such DandO Insurance cannot be obtained for 300% of such last annual
premium or less, in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall remain
obligated to provide the greatest DandO Insurance coverage as may be obtained
for such amount). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior
to the Effective Time and remain in effect for an aggregate period of six (6)
years, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for
an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder or if such policies are terminated
or cancelled, obtain alternate DandO Insurance on the terms set forth above. 

  

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this  _Section 8.14_ are subject to the damage limitation set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and  _Section 7.2(f)_.
