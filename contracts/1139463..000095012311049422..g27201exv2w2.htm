To compensate Seller for services rendered and medicine, drugs and supplies provided on or before the Closing Date (the " _Transition Patient Services_ ") with respect to patients admitted to the Hospital on or before the Closing Date (or who were in the Hospitals emergency department or in observation beds on the Closing Date and immediately thereafter admitted to the Hospital) but who are not discharged until after the Closing Date (such patients being referred to herein as the " _Transition Patients_ "), the parties shall take the following actions: 

   

 (a) _Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and Other DRG Transition Patients_. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule itemizing the Transition Patient Services provided by Seller to Transition Patients whose care is reimbursed by the Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or other third party payor program on a diagnostic related group basis, case rate or similar basis (each a " _DRG Transition Patient_ "). Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to (i) the DRG and outlier payments, the case rate payments or other similar payments received by Buyer on behalf of each DRG Transition Patient, or, with respect to any DRG Transition Patient covered by the Acute Care Episode Demonstration Project (the " _ACE Demonstration Project_ "), the amount payable for the applicable DRG as set forth on _Schedule 10.1(a)_, 

   ##### 

  

    

multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total charges
for Transition Patient Services provided to such DRG Transition Patient by
Seller, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total charges
for all services provided to such DRG Transition Patient both before and
after the Closing Date minus (ii) any deposits or co-payments made by such
DRG Transition Patient to Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect
to any DRG Transition Patient who is covered by the ACE Demonstration
Project, the total amount of payments received by Buyer for purposes
of allocating payments between the parties under this Section 10.1(a) shall
not include the portion of such payments attributable to the professional
component of services provided to such DRG Transition Patient. 

   

 (b) _Other Patients_. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare cut-off billings for Transition Patient Services provided by Seller for all patients not covered by Section 10.1(a). Seller shall be entitled to receive all amounts collected in respect of such cut-off billings. Buyer shall remit to Seller any amounts Buyer receives after the Closing with respect to the Transition Patient Services rendered to such Transition Patients, including any periodic interim payments or portions thereof applicable to the period on or prior to the Closing. 

   

 (c) All payments required by this Section 10.1 shall be made within ten (10) business days following the conclusion of the preceding month in which any payments are received by Buyer, accompanied by copies of remittances and other supporting documentation as reasonably required by Seller. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any amount to be paid under this Section 10.1, then such amount shall be determined by the accounting firm through the binding process provided in Section 2.8 at the joint equal expense of Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to and promptly following the Closing to: (i) obtain all Permits and Approvals necessary to bill and collect for the Transition Patient Services and (ii) to bill and collect for the Transition Patient services in accordance with the applicable requirements of third party payors.

Buyer, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and at the sole cost and expense of Seller, will cooperate with Seller in regard to the preparation, filing, handling and appeal of any Cost 

   ##### 

  

 

Reports. Such cooperation shall include the providing of statistics and
obtaining files if in the possession of Buyer and the coordination with
Seller pursuant to adequate notice of Medicare and Medicaid exit conferences
or meetings as well as providing to appropriate parties (including the
Provider Reimbursement Review Board), as determined to be reasonably necessary
by Seller, a letter acknowledging that Seller retained all rights to such
appeals, and that Buyer agrees that Seller has the right to pursue such
appeals, either on Sellers behalf, or to the extent required by Law, as a
representative of Buyer. Seller shall retain the originals of Cost
Reports, correspondence, work papers and other documents relating to Cost
Reports and the Agency Receivables. Seller will furnish copies of such
documents (other than work papers) to Buyer prior to the Closing to the
extent then existing if requested by Buyer. 

   

 10.3 _Employees; Benefits_. 

   

 (a) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment to all Hospital Employees who are employed by Seller and not on leave of any sort as of the Closing, _provided_  that those employees meet the pre-employment screening requirements of Buyer. Buyer shall offer employment to any Hospital Employee who is employed by Seller and on short-term leave as of the Closing under one of the programs listed on _Schedule 5.15_, which offer of employment shall be made effective as of the date such Hospital Employee is cleared for and returns to active work status, _provided_ that those employees meet the pre-employment screening requirements of Buyer and, _provided_ _further_ , that Buyer shall have an obligation to offer employment to any Hospital Employee who is on short term leave, but if such leave is not a statutory leave, only if such individual returns to active work status within six (6) months of the Closing Date. The offer of employment to the Hospital Employees shall be at their existing job duties, titles and responsibilities and at their existing base wage and salary levels. Except for Accrued PTO and ESR Leave or as provided in Section 10.3(c), no obligations of Seller to or with respect to any of its employees, including, but not limited to, obligations for accrued vacation, sick and personal leave, severance pay, obligations under employment contracts, Plans, employee handbooks or policies, collective bargaining agreements, and applicable Law (including liability for payroll Taxes and other proper deductions and withholdings) are being assumed by Buyer, and except as may be specifically required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not be obligated to continue any employment relationship with any employee for any specific period of time. 

   

 (b) The term " _Hired Employee_ " as used in this Agreement means a Hospital Employee who accepts employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date. All Hired Employees will be retained as employees-at-will (except to the extent that such Hired Employees are parties to Contracts providing for other employment terms as disclosed on _Schedule 5.11_, in which case such Hired Employees shall be retained in accordance with the terms of such Contracts). Buyer shall provide each Hired Employee with employee benefits, including but not limited to retirement, welfare and paid time off, consistent with similarly-situated employees at other healthcare facilities owned and/or operated by Buyer and its Affiliates. With respect to such employee benefits, Buyer shall honor the Hired Employees prior service credit under the Sellers current welfare plans for purposes of eligibility and satisfying pre-existing condition limitations in the welfare 

   ##### 

  

    

benefit plans of Buyer. Buyer shall honor the Hired Employees prior length of
service with Seller for purposes of eligibility and vesting in the retirement
benefit plans and other service-based plans of Buyer such as paid time off,
but shall not accrue benefits or make contributions to such plans with
respect to any such prior service. For purposes of retirement benefit plans
offered by Buyer, such vesting credit shall be extended at the rate of one
(1) year of credit for each whole twelve-month period elapsed since each
Hired Employees most recent date of hire with Seller as of Closing. Buyer
shall carry over, and give credit for, the Accrued PTO and ESR Leave for the
Hired Employees to the extent the value of such time is included in the
determination of the Final NWC Calculation. Participation in Buyers employee
programs and plans described in this Section 10.3 shall begin as soon as
administratively feasible after the Closing Date for participating
Hired Employees (and eligible dependents) and for all other Hired Employees
who, given their service with Seller, have met the age and service
requirements for participation under Buyers programs and plans. Buyer shall
employ a sufficient number of Hired Employees at the Hospital for at least a
90-day period following the Closing Date so as not to constitute a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms are used in the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 _et seq_., the " _WARN Act_
"), with respect to the Hospital. Buyer shall be liable and responsible for
any notification required under the WARN Act (or under any similar state or
local Law) and shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from any claims
arising out of a breach of this covenant. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall provide continued health and medical coverage to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") to each current or former employee of the Hospital (and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries) who is classified as an "MandA Qualified Beneficiary" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA 4), each of whom is listed on  _Schedule 10.3_. 

   

 (d) Seller shall retain the responsibility for payment of all medical, dental, vision, health and disability claims incurred by any Hired Employee prior to the date that such Hired Employee terminates employment with the Seller (his or her " _Separation Date_ "), and Buyer does not assume any liability with respect to such claims. On or after the applicable Separation Date, all medical, dental, vision, health and disability claims incurred by Hired Employees in Buyers employ will be determined under Buyers benefit plans. Buyer agrees that it shall use its best efforts, to the extent commercially reasonable, upon presentation of an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) by the Hired Employees and their eligible dependents, to cause them to receive credit under Buyers health care plans for any amounts paid toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums by such Hired Employees and enrolled dependents for the portion of the current plan year preceding the Closing under a health care plan maintained by the Seller. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no term of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) create any Contract with any Hired Employee, (ii) give any Hired Employee the right to be retained in the employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) interfere with the right of Buyer to terminate employment of any Hired 

   ##### 

  

    

Employee at any time. Nothing in this Agreement shall diminish the right of
Buyer to change or terminate its policies regarding salaries, benefits and
other employment matters at any time or from time to time. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and the Hired Employees are not
intended to be and shall not be construed as beneficiaries hereof. Pursuant to
the "Standard Procedure" provided in Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53,
(i) Buyer and Seller shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as set
forth therein, (ii) Seller will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with
respect to any Hired Employees, and (iii) Buyer will undertake to file (or
cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Hired Employee with respect to
the portion of the year during which such Hired Employees are employed by
Buyer that includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such year that
such Hired Employee was employed by Seller. 

  

 10.4 _Misdirected Payments_. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to remit, with reasonable promptness, to the other any payments received, which payments are on or in respect of accounts or notes receivable owned by (or are otherwise payable to) the other. In addition, and without limitation, in the event of a determination by any Governmental Entity or third-party payor that payments to the Seller or the Hospital resulted in an overpayment or other determination that funds previously paid by any program or plan to Seller or the Hospital must be repaid, Seller shall be responsible for repayment of said monies (or defense of such actions) if such overpayment or other repayment determination was for services rendered on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall be responsible for repayment of said monies (or defense of such actions) if such overpayment or other repayment determination was for services rendered after the Closing Date. In the event that, following Closing, Buyer suffers any offsets against reimbursement under any third-party payor or reimbursement programs due to Buyer relating to amounts owing under any such programs by Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller shall immediately upon demand from Buyer pay to Buyer the amounts so billed or offset. These obligations shall be in addition to any other remedies available herein. 

  

ARTICLE 11 

   

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its agents in connection with the preparation of financial statements, costs reports and Tax returns relating to the period prior to Closing. In addition, Seller shall be entitled to remove from the Hospital any such patient records, but only for purposes of pending litigation involving a patient to whom such records refer, as certified in writing prior to removal by counsel retained by Seller in connection with such litigation. Any patient records so removed from the Hospital shall be promptly returned to Buyer following its use by Seller. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its insurance carriers in connection with the defense of claims made by third parties against Seller in respect of alleged events occurring while Seller operated the Hospital; _provided_ , Seller shall reimburse Buyer its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses incurred in providing such cooperation. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, making all of the Buyers employees reasonably available for interviews, 

   ##### 

  

    

depositions, hearings and trial; and making all of the Buyers employees
reasonably available to assist in the securing and giving of evidence and in
obtaining the presence and cooperation of witnesses, all of which shall be
done without payment of any fees to Buyer or its employees or the payment of
any of Buyers internal expenses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall
pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses incurred
by such employees (including for travel). In addition, Seller shall be
entitled to remove from the Hospital any records, but only for purposes of
pending litigation involving the Person to whom such records refer, as
certified in writing prior to removal by counsel retained by Seller in
connection with such litigation. Any records so removed from the Hospital
shall be promptly returned to Buyer following their use by Seller.

This Agreement and all documents relating hereto, including (i) consents, waivers and modifications which may hereafter be executed, (ii) the documents delivered at the Closing, and (iii) financial statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished to Seller or Buyer, may, subject to the provisions of Section 12.8, be reproduced by Seller and by Buyer by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic or other similar process and Seller and Buyer may destroy any original documents so reproduced. Seller and Buyer agree and stipulate that any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by Seller or Buyer in the regular course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. 

  

 11.5 _Tax Matters_. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate fully with each other and shall provide to the other, as reasonably requested by and at the expense of the requesting party, all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities of the requesting party for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing and shall preserve all such information, records and documents (to the extent a part of the assets exchanged and delivered at Closing) at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof; _provided_ , that neither party shall be required to provide any of its income Tax returns (or supporting materials including working papers and Tax provisions) or those of any Affiliate. Each party shall retain all Tax returns and supporting materials received pursuant to Section 2.1 at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions with respect thereto and shall not destroy such items without first offering such items back to the other party prior to destruction. Buyer and Seller agree to elect the standard procedure under Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for information returns to employees and under Revenue Procedure 99-50 for information reporting to non-employees. 

  

 11.6 _Consented Assignment and Permits_. Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining any and all consents to assign any Assumed Contract and any and all Permits and Approvals necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. However, if any such consent to assignment of an Assumed Contract is not obtained as of the Closing, such Assumed Contract will still be assigned to and assumed by Buyer under this Agreement effective as of the Effective Time. Further, at the request of Buyer, Seller will cooperate in any reasonable 

   ##### 

  

 

arrangement with Buyer designed to provide for Buyer the benefits and
obligations under any such Assumed Contract, including enforcement of any and
all rights of Seller against the other party or parties thereto arising out
of the breach or cancellation by such other party or otherwise.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall have the right, for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, to operate under the licenses and registrations of Seller relating to controlled substances and the operations of pharmacies and laboratories, until Buyer is able to obtain such licenses and registrations for itself. In furtherance thereof, Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer at or prior to the Closing a limited power of attorney substantially in the form of  _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 (a) The risk of loss or damage to any of the Purchased Assets, the Hospital and all other property, transfer of which is contemplated by this Agreement, shall remain with Seller until the Closing and Seller shall maintain its insurance policies covering the Purchased Assets, the Hospital and all other property through the Closing. 

  

 (b) If, prior to the Closing, all or any part of the Hospital is partially destroyed or damaged by fire or the elements or by any other cause where such damage or destruction is in the aggregate (the " _Aggregate Damage_ ") less than ten percent (10%) of the Interim Cash Purchase Price and such damage or destruction would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere with or disrupt operations at the Hospital in a manner which, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, the parties duties and obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected and the Closing shall proceed as scheduled; _provided_ ,  _however_ , Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or its designated Affiliate all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to any insurance proceeds on account of such damage or destruction, including without limitation the proceeds of Sellers business interruption insurance policy, and the amount of the Interim Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any deductibles under such insurance policies. If, prior to the Closing, all or any part of the Hospital is destroyed or damaged by fire or the elements or by any other cause where the Aggregate Damage exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Interim Cash Purchase Price or where such damage or destruction could reasonably be expected to materially interfere with or disrupt operations at the Hospital in a manner which, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer may elect to (i) purchase the Hospital, and the Closing shall proceed as scheduled ( _provided_ , _however_ , at the Closing, Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to any insurance proceeds on account of such damage or destruction, including without limitation the proceeds of Sellers business interruption insurance policy, and the amount of the Interim Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any deductibles under such insurance policies) or (ii) terminate the Agreement by the delivery of a written notice to Seller on or before the scheduled date of Closing (the " _Casualty Termination Notice_ "). If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon the amount of the Aggregate Damage, the amount of the Aggregate Damage shall be determined by a consulting firm mutually selected by Seller and Buyer (the "Independent Consultant") pursuant to Section 11.8(c). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If pursuant to Section 11.8(b), the amount of the Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Interim Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is to be determined by the Independent Consultant, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the occurrence of the damage to the Hospital (the " _Submittal Date_ "), each party shall submit to the other party and to the Independent Consultant its proposed Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Interim Cash Purchase Price adjustment) as a result of the event(s) contemplated by Section 11.8(b), along with a detailed description of the basis for such amount and any applicable adjustment. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Submittal Date (the " _Decision Date_ "), the Independent Consultant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall determine the definitive amount of the Aggregate Damage, taking into account any submissions by Seller or Buyer by the Submittal Date. The decision of the Independent Consultant as the amount of Aggregate Damage shall be conclusive and binding as between Buyer and Seller, and the costs of such review shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. 

  

 11.9 _Change of Name_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall (a) amend its charter and take all other actions necessary to change its name to one sufficiently dissimilar to Sellers present name to avoid confusion, and (b) take all actions requested by Buyer to enable Buyer to use any names acquired by Buyer at the Closing. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall make no further use of (i) the name "Heart Hospital of New Mexico, LLC" or any derivative thereof, or (ii) any other name that is sufficiently similar to "New Mexico Heart Hospital, LLC" so as to potentially cause confusion. 

  

 11.10 _Transition Services Agreement_. As of Closing, Affiliates of Seller and of Buyer will execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement (" _Transition Services Agreement_ "), pursuant to which an Affiliate of Seller, or a qualified third-party designated by an Affiliate of Seller, will provide certain specified transition services to and for the benefit of Buyer and its Affiliates in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. 

  

 11.11 _CVSTAT Program_. As of Closing, pursuant to a separate License Agreement (the " _CVSTAT License Agreement_ "), and for and in consideration of the consummation of the transactions described herein, MedCath Corporation shall grant Buyer a non-exclusive license to use the trademark "CVSTAT" and to operate the CVSTAT program at the Hospital in the same manner as same is operated at the Hospital as of the date of this Agreement. The CVSTAT License Agreement shall not require the payment of any license fees, royalties or other fees, and shall be upon such other terms and conditions as MedCath Corporation and Buyer may mutually agree. 

  

 11.12 _Quality Reporting_. Seller shall submit all quality data required under the HQI Program to CMS or its agent, and all quality data required under ORYX to The Joint Commission, for any calendar quarter with reporting deadlines between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. If a calendar quarter ends prior to the Closing Date, but the reporting deadline for such quarter ends after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and submit the quality data for the Hospital required under the HQI Program and ORYX in accordance with applicable filing deadlines and in the form and manner required by CMS and The Joint Commission, respectively, or, at the sole option to Buyer, Seller shall transmit such quality data to Buyer in a form mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller or allow Buyer access to such data, to 

   ##### 

  

 

enable Buyer to submit quality data for the Hospital required under the HQI
Program and ORYX for such quarter. If the Closing Date falls between the
first and last day of a calendar quarter, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer
to ensure that all quality data required to be submitted for the Hospital
under the HQI Program and ORYX for the portion of the quarter during which
Seller owned the Hospital can be aggregated with the quality data for the
portion of the quarter during which Buyer owned the Hospital, to enable Buyer
and/or Seller to submit quality data for the Hospital required under the HQI
Program and ORYX in accordance with applicable filing deadlines and in
the form and manner required by CMS and The Joint Commission, respectively. 

   

 11.13 _Supplemental Insurance_. Seller, at its sole cost and expense, will obtain a supplemental insurance policy providing for extended reporting periods for claims made on or after the Effective Time in respect of events occurring prior to the Effective Time to insure against professional liabilities of Seller relating to all periods prior to the Effective Time and to have the effect of converting its current professional liability insurance into occurrence coverage. Such "tail end" insurance shall have the term and limits of coverage as reflected in _Schedule 11.13_. Buyer shall be named as an additional insured under the supplemental insurance policy. Seller shall deliver to Buyer evidence of such supplemental reporting endorsement at Closing. 

  

 11.14 _Seller s Covenant Not to Compete_. 

   

 (a) In consideration for the benefits the Seller (including Manager, MedCath Corporation and their Affiliates) will receive in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, which benefits are hereby acknowledged, and as further consideration for, and as a condition to, the transactions contemplated hereby, and so that Buyer and its Affiliates shall receive and be able to maintain the benefit of the goodwill, trade secrets and confidential information which Seller enjoys and has enjoyed in connection with its operation of the Hospital, and recognizing that the covenants contained herein are not severable from the goodwill and are granted to Buyer to protect the same, and to otherwise protect the legitimate business interests of Buyer, Seller covenants and agrees that at all times from the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller (including Manager, MedCath Corporation and their Affiliates) shall not, directly or indirectly, except as a consultant or contractor to or of Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer), own, lease, manage, operate or control any acute care hospital, specialty hospital, or ambulatory or other type of surgery center (any of such uses being referred to herein as a " _Competing Business_ "), within a 25-mile radius of the Hospital (the " _Restricted Area_ "), without Buyers prior written consent (which Buyer may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion). In the event of a breach of this Section 11.14, Seller recognizes that monetary damages shall be inadequate to compensate Buyer and Buyer shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond or similar security, to an injunction restraining such breach, with the costs (including attorneys fees) of successfully securing such injunction to be borne by Seller. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing any other remedy available to it under this Agreement for such breach or threatened breach. All parties hereto hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against the competition of Seller (including Manager, MedCath Corporation and their Affiliates) and that the nature and scope of such protection has been carefully considered by the parties. Seller further acknowledges 

   ##### 

  

    

and agrees that the covenants and provisions of this Section 11.14 form part
of the consideration under this Agreement and are among the inducements for
Buyer entering into and consummating the transactions contemplated herein.
The period provided and the area covered are expressly represented and agreed
to be fair, reasonable and necessary. The consideration provided for herein
is deemed to be sufficient and adequate to compensate for agreeing to the
restrictions contained in this Section 11.14. If, however, any court
determines that the foregoing restrictions are not reasonable, such
restrictions shall be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much
of their nature and scope as will render them enforceable. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.14 to the contrary, a Person that enters into a Change in Control Transaction with MedCath Corporation or its Affiliates shall not be considered an assignee or successor of Seller or its Affiliates for purposes of this Section 11.14 or otherwise be bound by this Section 11.14. 

   

 (c) Further, in no event shall any Person (other than an Affiliate of MedCath Corporation) that purchases one or more hospital facilities from MedCath Corporation or one of its Affiliates (by the acquisition of either the assets thereof or the equity securities of such Affiliate) in a transaction that is not a Change in Control Transaction, either be considered an assignee or successor of Seller or its Affiliates for purposes of this Section 11.14 or otherwise be bound by this Section 11.14. 

   

11.15 _Information from Virtual Data Room_. For a period of at least ninety
(90) days from and after Closing, Seller shall make available to Buyer, in a
format reasonably determined by Seller, the materials and information
contained at the time of Closing in the virtual data room that houses due
diligence materials and information provided by Seller to Buyer in connection
with the transactions described herein. 

  

 11.16 _MedCath Corporation Shareholder Approval; Termination Fee_. 

   

 (a) In the event that MedCath Corporation shareholder approval is determined by MedCath Corporation to be required with respect to the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyer and the shareholders of MedCath Corporation fail to give such approval by the Outside Date, then as long as there has been no material default by Buyer with respect to its liabilities and obligations arising under this Agreement, MedCath Corporation shall reimburse Buyer for all of its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, costs and expenses of accountants, attorneys, engineers, valuation experts and other consultants) incurred or paid by Buyer in connection with Buyers due diligence, Buyers negotiation of this Agreement and, generally, in connection with the transactions described herein, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $750,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "). MedCath Corporation shall reimburse Buyer for such costs and expenses within ten (10) days after the receipt of an invoice for same from Buyer that schedules the costs and expenses incurred or paid by Buyer. This Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) In the event that (i) as a result of the exercise of the fiduciary duties, or other comparable duties, of the board of directors of MedCath Corporation to its shareholders, the Seller does not fulfill its obligations to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and as a result thereof Buyer terminates this Agreement, and (ii) there has been no material default by Buyer with respect to its liabilities and obligations arising under this Agreement, then either (x) if within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement, Seller consummates the sale of either the Purchased Assets or a majority of the membership interest of the Seller to a third party (the " _Third Party Sale_ "), then as the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer, within ten days of the consummation of the Third Party Sale, Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash a termination fee equal to Three Million Two Hundred Thirteen Thousand Dollars ($3,213,000), in which event Buyer shall not be entitled to any amount under subsection (a) above, or (y) if the conditions of subsection (x) are not satisfied, then as the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to the Expense Reimbursement. This Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 11.17 _Post Closing Access to Information_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that subsequent to Closing each party may need access to information or documents in the control or possession of the other party for the purposes of concluding the transactions herein contemplated, audits, compliance with governmental requirements and regulations, and the prosecution or defense of third party claims. Accordingly, Seller and Buyer agree that for a period of six (6) years after Closing each will make reasonably available to the others agents, independent auditors, counsel, and/or governmental agencies upon written request and at the out-of-pocket expense of the requesting party such documents and information as may be available relating to the Hospital for periods prior and subsequent to Closing to the extent necessary to facilitate concluding the transactions herein contemplated, audits, compliance with governmental requirements and regulations, and the prosecution or defense of claims. The obligations of Seller in this Section 11.17 shall in all events be subject to and limited by the rights of Seller and its Affiliates set forth in Section 12.23, including but not limited to the rights to dissolve Seller and MedCath Corporation.

 12.4 _Benefit; Assignment_. Subject to provisions herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. No party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party hereto may assign its interest (or a portion thereof) in this Agreement to an Affiliate, but, in such event, the assignor shall be required to remain obligated hereunder in the same manner as if such assignment had not been effected. 

  

 12.5 _Effective Time; Accounting Date_. The transactions contemplated hereby shall be effective for accounting purposes as of 11:59 p.m. (the " _Effective Time_ ") on the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to be effective as of a month end. 

  

 12.6 _No Brokerage_. Buyer and Seller represent to each other that no broker has in any way been contracted in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby other than Sellers

or a Seller Affiliates engagement of Navigant Capital Advisors, LLC, the fees
and expenses of which shall be borne solely by Seller or a Seller Affiliate.

It is understood by the parties hereto that the information, documents and instruments delivered to Seller by Buyer or the agents of Buyer and the information, documents and instruments delivered to Buyer by Seller or Sellers agents are of a confidential and proprietary nature. Each of the parties hereto agrees that both prior and subsequent to Closing it will maintain the confidentiality of all such confidential information, documents or instruments delivered to it by the other party hereto or its agents in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or in compliance with the terms, conditions and covenants hereof and only disclose such information, documents and instruments to its duly authorized officers, directors, representatives and agents unless (i) compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process (including, without limitation, in connection with obtaining the necessary Approvals of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) or by other requirements of Law or (ii) disclosed in an action or proceeding brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto shall not disclose any confidential information not required to be disclosed as part of such permitted disclosure. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, it will return all such documents and instruments and all copies thereof in its possession to the other party to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto recognizes that any breach of this Section 12.8 would result in irreparable harm to the other party to this Agreement and its Affiliates and that therefore the non-breaching party shall 

   ##### 

  

 

be entitled to an injunction to prohibit any such breach or anticipated
breach, without the necessity of posting a bond, cash or otherwise, in
addition to all of their other legal and equitable remedies. Nothing in this
Section 12.8, however, shall prohibit the use of such confidential
information, documents or information for the purpose of securing financing to
either party to effect the purchase and sale of assets hereunder or such
governmental filings as in the mutual opinion of Sellers counsel and counsel
for Buyer are (i) required by Law or (ii) otherwise appropriate. Also, this

 (d) In the case of Buyer, Seller fails to convey to Buyer at Closing good and marketable title to the Purchased Assets subject to no Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any matter relating to the Owned Real Property, Buyer may seek to recover damages and recover damages from Seller under this Agreement only if Buyer has first asserted (and used commercially reasonable efforts to recoup) its rights and remedies against the Title Company and the title insurance policy issued thereby with respect to the Owned Real Property. 

  

 12.23 _Right to Take Limited Liability Company and Corporate Action_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein shall prevent or limit, and Buyer shall not take actions to prevent or limit, (a) Seller at any time after the Effective Time from being dissolved or liquidated, making payments to its creditors or distributions to its members, otherwise terminating its existence and/or taking any other limited liability company act, in each case, as permitted by the New Mexico Limited Liability Company Act, or (b) MedCath Corporation and its Affiliates from engaging in or agreeing to a Change in Control Transaction or making payments to its creditors or distributions to its stockholders at any time or, after the Effective Time, from being dissolved or liquidated, and/ or otherwise terminating its existence, in each case, as permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
