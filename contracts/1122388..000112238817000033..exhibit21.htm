this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each share of

dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring in compliance with the terms hereof after the Agreement Date
and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified
numbers of shares (or any per share dollar amounts) of any class or series
affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices or other per share
dollar amounts therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the
extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

2.2 Treatment of Company Options.

(a) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option
that is not an Underwater Option shall terminate and be cancelled without
further action by the parties hereto or the Company Optionholders and upon the
cancellation thereof such Company Option shall be converted into the right to
receive, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, an amount in cash equal to (i) the Residual Per Share Amount, minus
(ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option or Promised Option, minus (iii) the Per Share Escrow
Contribution Amount with respect to such share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option or Promised Option, minus (iv) the Per Share Expense
Fund Contribution Amount with respect to such share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option or Promised Option (such amount, a "Cash Option
Payment" and the sum of all such payments, the "Aggregate Cash Option
Payment"). Each Vested Company Option that is an Underwater Option shall be
cancelled and terminated without consideration upon the Effective Time. All
consideration to be received by the holders of Withholding Options pursuant to
this Section 2.2(a) shall be paid to and distributed by the Surviving
Corporation promptly after the Effective Time and delivery of an executed
consent to have such holder's Cash Option Payment 



subject to the provisions of Sections 2.4 and Article 9 of the Agreement (an
"Optionholder Consent"), and shall be treated as compensation by it and shall
be net of any applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.9. All
consideration to be received by the holders of Company Options and the
intended recipients of Promised Options, in each case that are not Withholding
Options pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) shall be paid to and distributed by
the Exchange Agent to such Company Optionholder. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide notice and a form of Optionholder Consent (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of Vested Company Options
describing the treatment of the Vested Company Options in accordance with this
Section 2.2(a).

(b) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company
Option held by a Company Continuing Employee shall, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate and be cancelled,
and, upon the cancellation thereof, such Unvested Company Option shall be
converted into the right to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Unvested Company Option, an amount in cash equal to (i) the
Residual Per Share Amount, minus (ii) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option (the "Unvested Cash
Option Payment") subject to the restrictions and other terms of vesting,
including continued employment as set forth in a Vesting Cash Payment Notice,
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Vesting Cash
Payment Notice") and subject to any modifications that may be required by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Unvested Cash Option Payment shall not
automatically be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead
become payable by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation on the date set
forth in the applicable Vesting Cash Payment Notice (subject to the
restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule, including continued
employment). The Vesting Cash Payment Notice will provide that (A) individual
dollar allocations will be paid out in accordance with the same vesting
schedule applicable to those Unvested Company Options, (B) subject to the
terms and conditions regarding vesting of the standard form of agreement for
the issuance of Company Options under the Company Stock Plan and any
deviations from the vesting on such standard forms disclosed on Schedule
3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in order to receive any particular
installment payment, a participant must be currently employed by the Surviving
Corporation, or an Affiliate, on the applicable vesting date (i.e., no
prorated or accelerated payment will be made if a participant is terminated
prior to the applicable vesting date), and (C) no reallocation of any Unvested
Cash Option Payment will be made to any other Person. The Surviving
Corporation may in its discretion make all such required payments through its
or its Affiliates' regular payroll system no later than the last day of the
calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the Unvested
Cash Option Payment becomes vested under the applicable Vesting Cash Payment
Notice. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) shall be subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by Law to be withheld and shall be paid
without interest. Subject to the terms of the Unvested Company Option
(including the Company Stock Plan), no Unvested Cash Option Payment, or right
thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including
any transfer by operation of Law) by any Person, other than Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person prior to the
distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash Option Payment in accordance
with this Agreement. Each Unvested Company Option held by a Company
Optionholder who is not a Company Continuing Employee shall be cancelled and
terminated without consideration upon the Effective Time.

(c) Company Actions. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or
cause to be taken such actions, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
required to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2. 



(d) Acceleration. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Parent, the
Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any Company
Options beyond what is specified in Schedule 3.4(b) or Schedule 5.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

2.3 Adjustments.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent the Estimated Financials Statement. The Company
shall provide Parent and its accounting and financial staff, auditors and
advisors reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and its
accounting and financial staff in connection with Parent's review thereof. The
Company shall consider in good faith any comments or proposed changes to the
estimated Closing Working Capital Amount that may be suggested by Parent in
the period following delivery thereof but prior to the Closing, but, for
clarity, the Company shall have no obligation to make any changes to Estimated
Financials Statement, including the estimated Closing Working Capital Amount.
The Estimated Financials Statement, as finally prepared by the Company, shall
be used to determine the initial Adjusted Transaction Value for purposes of
the payments contemplated to be made by Parent in connection with the Closing.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than
90 days following the Closing Date, its initial draft of the Closing
Statement. The preparation of the Closing Statement by Parent shall be for the
sole purpose of determining differences between the Estimated Financials
Statement and the Closing Statement and the resulting calculation of the
Adjusted Transaction Value. The Closing Statement shall be prepared and the
Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the amount of the Unpaid
Transaction Fees, the amount of Indemnified Taxes and the Closing Working
Capital Amount shall be determined in accordance with the Agreed Principles.

(c) The Representative shall have 60 days from its receipt of the Closing
Statement (the "Objection Period") to review the Closing Statement. Parent
shall grant the Representative access at reasonable times and places and upon
reasonable advance notice to all books, records and employees of the Surviving
Corporation as reasonably requested by the Representative in connection with
its review of the Closing Statement. Upon the expiration of the Objection
Period, the Representative, on behalf of all Company Securityholders, shall be
deemed to have accepted, and shall be bound by, the Closing Statement and the
calculations therein, unless the Representative shall have informed Parent in
writing of its disagreement with the Closing Statement prior to the expiration
of the Objection Period (the "Objection"), specifying each disputed item and
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such dispute (each, a
"Disputed Item"). Parent shall have 30 days from the date on which it receives
the Objection (the date on which such 30 day period ends, the "Response Date")
to review and respond to such Objection. If Parent and the Representative are
able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each Disputed Item, and
each signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the items therein, as adjusted to reflect such resolution,
shall be deemed final, non-appealable and binding for purposes of this
Agreement. If any Disputed Items have not been resolved by the Response Date,
either Parent or the Representative may refer such Disputed Items to an
independent, mutually agreeable, nationally recognized public accounting firm
(the "Accounting Referee") who shall accept its appointment within seven days
after such referral, to make a final, non-appealable and binding determination
as to such remaining Disputed Items pursuant to the terms hereof. The
Accounting Referee shall be directed to make a determination of the Disputed
Items in accordance with Section 2.3(d) promptly, but no later than 30 days,
after acceptance of its appointment. Parent and the Representative agree to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect the selection and
appointment of the Accounting Referee pursuant to this Section 2.3(c),
including executing an engagement agreement with the Accounting Referee
providing for reasonable and customary compensation and other terms of such
engagement. Parent and the Representative shall make readily available to the
Accounting Referee all 



relevant books, records and employees of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation that are reasonably requested by the Accounting Referee in
connection with the Accounting Referee's review of any Disputed Items.

(d) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee for resolution
pursuant to Section 2.3(c), the Accounting Referee shall determine only with
respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and to what extent, if any,
the items included in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. With respect
to each Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee's determination shall be within
the range of values assigned to such Disputed Item by Parent and the
Representative. Any finding by the Accounting Referee shall be (i) a reasoned
award stating in reasonable detail the findings of fact on which it is based,
(ii) final, non-appealable and binding upon the parties hereto and (iii) the
sole and exclusive remedy between the parties hereto regarding the Disputed
Items so presented. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be
borne by Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Company
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Escrow Shares) in
the same proportion that the dollar amount of Disputed Items which are not
resolved in favor of Parent or the Representative, as applicable, bears to the
total dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each
of Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Escrow Shares) shall bear the fees,
costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other expenses
incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this Section 2.3.

(e) Payment of the Adjustments.

(i) Payment of the adjustments as contemplated by this Section 2.3(e) shall be
made (A) if no Objection is made by the Representative during the Objection
Period, within five Business Days following the expiration of the Objection
Period or (B) if the Representative submits an Objection within the Objection
Period, within five Business Days following final resolution of all Disputed
Items by either Parent and the Representative or the Accounting Referee.

(ii) If, upon the final determination of the Closing Statement as provided in
Section 2.3(c) or 2.3(d), if the resulting calculation of the Adjusted
Transaction Value is greater than the Adjusted Transaction Value determined
using the Estimated Financials Statement, Parent shall promptly deliver, or
cause to be delivered, an aggregate amount in cash equal to such excess to (A)
the Exchange Agent for payment to the Company Stockholders and the holders of
Vested Company Options (other than Persons holding only Underwater Options)
who are not subject to Tax withholding in accordance with the Exchange Agent
Agreement and (B) to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, for
subsequent release to the holders of Withholding Options as part of the second
regularly scheduled payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation or such
Affiliate following such release. Subject to Section 9.9, any such amounts
shall be promptly distributed to the Company Stockholders and the holders of
Vested Company Options (other than Persons holding only Underwater Options) in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Escrow Shares.

(iii) If, upon the final determination of the Closing Statement as provided in
Section 2.3(c) or 2.3(d), the Adjusted Transaction Value determined using the
Estimated Financials Statement is greater than the Adjusted Transaction Value
calculated from the Closing Statement, the Representative and Parent shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release an amount in cash equal to such excess
from the Escrow Fund to Parent.

(iv) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price. 



2.4 Escrow; Expense Fund.

(a) Escrow Amount. At the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold the Escrow
Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.2(a) to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders
and Company Optionholders. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit in escrow
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement an amount in cash equal to the Escrow Amount
(the "Escrow Cash").

(b) Escrow Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent, the Representative and the
Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Escrow Agreement"). At or promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Escrow Agent the Escrow Cash. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow
Agent as partial security for the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement, and the
Escrow Fund shall be subject to reduction for Claims as provided in Article 9.
Each Indemnifying Party's rights, if any, to receive amounts from the Escrow
Fund are non-transferable and non-assignable. No interest shall accrue on the
amounts held in the Escrow Fund. Fifty percent (50%) of the fees of the Escrow
Agent shall constitute a Transaction Fee and Parent shall pay the other fifty
percent (50%) of the fees of the Escrow Agent.

(c) Expense Fund Amount. Parent shall withhold the Expense Fund Amount from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section
2.1(e) and Section 2.2(a) to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders and Company
Optionholders; and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, Parent shall make, or cause to be made, payment of an amount in cash
equal to the Expense Fund Amount by wire transfer to a segregated client bank
account maintained by the Representative, to be held in such segregated client
bank account and distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Expense Fund Amount as contemplated herein shall reflect a proportionate
contribution from each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and Company Optionholder in
an amount equal to such Person's Pro Rata Indemnity Share of such amount.

(d) Tax. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Amount is intended
to be part of the aggregate acquisition consideration payable in exchange for
Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement. Parent and the
Company agree that: (i) except with respect to interest imputed described in
clause (ii) the parties agree to report payments of the Escrow Amount for U.S.
federal and state and foreign income Tax purposes consistent with such
treatment unless otherwise required by a change in applicable Law following
the date hereof or a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code, (ii) if and to the extent any part of the Escrow Amount is actually
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties, interest may be imputed on such
amount payable as required by Sections 483 or 1274 of the Code, and (iii) the
Indemnifying Parties shall be required to report as interest income, and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct as interest expense, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the imputed interest amount described in
preceding clause (ii).

2.5 The Closing. Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article 8, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter
LLP, 135 Commonwealth Drive, Menlo Park, California, 94025, at 10:00 a.m.
Pacific time on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date or at such later date
and time as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger, in customary form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL (the time of such
filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, shall be referred to
herein as the "Effective Time"). 



2.6 Effects of the Merger. At and upon the Effective Time:

(a) The separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger. The effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
powers, privileges and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall be
vested in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, obligations liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.

(b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any other Person, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its
entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except the name shall remain
Velocify, Inc. and the provisions relating to the incorporator shall be

U.S. Bank National Association (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the

Consideration, minus (2) the Withholding Options Closing Payment, minus (3)
the Escrow Amount, minus (4) the Expense Fund Amount, to be held by the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the exchange agent agreement
(the "Exchange Agent Agreement") to be executed prior to the Closing by Parent

attributable to such Withholding Options, which 



shall be distributed in accordance with Section 2.2(a). Parent shall pay all

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, to each Company
Stockholder who holds a certificate or certificates that, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (a "Letter of Transmittal"). Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, to any Company Stockholder who delivers a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal (together with the Certificate(s) from the
Company Stockholders for cancellation or an affidavit of loss as described in
Section 2.7(c) below and any other documents as Parent shall reasonably
require), the Merger Consideration that such Company Stockholder has the right

(c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall, as promptly as practicable following the receipt by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, of such affidavit, issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
represented by the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange therefor
that the Company Stockholder has the right to receive. Parent may in its

owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Parent an
indemnity agreement or bond against any claim that may be made against Parent
with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or

except as provided herein or by Law.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no transfer of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If,

2.1(c) and Section 2.1(e), subject to the terms of Section 2.3, Section 2.4
and this Section 2.7.

(f) Calculation of Consideration. For purposes of calculating the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and
Section 2.2(a) to the Non-Dissenting Stockholders and Company Optionholders,
including for purposes of calculating their respective portions of the Escrow
Amount and Expense Fund Amount, (i) the consideration payable in respect of
shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each such Non-Dissenting
Stockholder shall be calculated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (ii)
the consideration payable in respect of Vested Company Options shall be
calculated on a grant-by-grant basis, and (iii) the amount of cash to be paid
to each of the Non-Dissenting Stockholders and Company Optionholders for each
such certificate or grant shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.

2.8 Dissenting Shares. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company
Capital Stock shall have demanded and perfected their appraisal rights or
dissenters' rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or, if
applicable, Chapter 13 of the CGCL, none of such Dissenting Shares shall be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
to the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 2.1(c) and
Section 2.1(e), but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such 



consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL or, if applicable, the CGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL or, if
applicable, Chapter 13 of the CGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair
value of such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the
DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the CGCL (but only after the value
therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the
DGCL or CGCL, as applicable). In the event that any Company Stockholder fails
to make an effective demand for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal
rights or dissenters' rights as to its shares of Company Capital Stock or any
Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then
any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(e) in respect
of such shares as if such shares had never been Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 2.7,
following the satisfaction of the applicable Payment Conditions, the Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder would have been entitled under
Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.1(e) with respect to such shares. The Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice (and in no event more than two
Business Days) of (i) any demand received by the Company for appraisal of
Company Capital Stock or notice of exercise of a Company Stockholder's
appraisal rights or dissenters' rights in accordance with the DGCL or, if
applicable, the CGCL, and (ii) the withdrawals of such demands and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL or, if applicable, the CGCL. The Company
agrees that, except with Parent's prior written consent, it shall not
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal or exercise of
appraisal rights.

2.9 Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
to be deducted and withheld, from the Merger Consideration or any other
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Escrow
Amount), the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment and, to the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. The parties agree
to effectuate such withholding with respect to payments to holders of
Withholding Options pursuant to Section 2.2(a), 2.3(e)(ii), and 2.7(a) and any
other compensatory payments hereunder by paying the applicable Merger
Consideration for which such withholding is required to the Surviving
Corporation and causing the Surviving Corporation to withhold the applicable
amounts through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system. Except for such
withholding rights, the recipient of any payments payable pursuant to this
Agreement is solely responsible for any and all Liabilities for Taxes that may
arise with respect to any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement. The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to reduce or avoid the deduction or withholding of Taxes on payments
made in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock under this Agreement,
including without limitation by affording payees reasonable opportunity to
provide documentation demonstrating a reduction in or exemption from such
deduction or withholding of taxes.

2.10 Further Assurances. If, after the Effective Time, any of the parties
hereto reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger or
to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement after the Effective
Time, then the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds,
assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably
necessary to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement.

(vii) The Company has not participated in and is not participating in an
international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code.

(viii) The Company has never requested or received a ruling from any Tax
authority or signed a closing agreement with any Tax authority.

(ix) The Company (A) has not, and has not ever had, a permanent establishment
in any country other than the country in which it is organized and resident,
(B) has not engaged in a trade or business in any country other than the
country in which it is organized and resident that subjected it to Tax in such
country, (C) is not, and has not ever been, subject to Tax in a jurisdiction
outside the country in which it is organized and resident, and (D) is not
required to register in any jurisdiction for VAT purposes pursuant to
applicable Law.

(x) None of the shares of Company Capital Stock are "covered securities" under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6045-1(a)(15). In the event that any shares of
Company Capital Stock are 



"covered securities," Schedule 3.7(c)(x) sets forth the cost basis and date of
issuance of such shares or securities.

(xi) The Company is not, nor has it been, a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code.

(d) No Tax Shelters. The Company has (i) no disclosure obligation under
Section 6662 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign
Law (ii) not participated in any reportable transaction within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) or any transaction that is
substantially similar to any of those transactions. The Company has not
consummated, has not participated in, and is not currently participating in
any transaction which was or is a "tax shelter" transaction as defined in
Sections 6662, 6011, 6012 or 6111 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(e) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.

(i) Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" under which the Company
makes, is obligated to make or promises to make, payments subject to Section
409A of the Code, if any, has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of
the Code, and the applicable Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder
so as to avoid any Tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code and the document
or documents that evidence each such plan have conformed to the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. No payment
pursuant to any arrangement between the Company and any "service provider" (as
such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) would subject any Person to a Tax pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise. No Company Benefit Arrangement or other Contract
provides a gross-up, reimbursement or other indemnification for any Tax or
related interest or penalty that may be imposed for failure to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(ii) All Company Options have been authorized by the board of directors of the
Company or an appropriate committee thereof, and, if required, approved by
stockholders of the Company by the necessary number of votes or written
consent, including approval of the option exercise price or the methodology
for determining the Company Option exercise price and the substantive option
terms. Each Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. No Company Option has been
retroactively granted, or the exercise price of any Company Option determined
retroactively. No Company Option or other right to acquire Company Common
Stock or other equity of the Company (A) has an exercise price that has been
or may be less than the fair market value of a share of the underlying stock
as of the date such Company Option or right was granted as determined in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code, (B) has any feature for the deferral
of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the
later of exercise or disposition of such Company Option or right, or (C) has
been granted with respect to any class of stock of the Company that is not
"service recipient stock" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder).

(f) Additional Tax Representations. The Company has never entered into any
Contract or maintained any Company Benefit Arrangement that could give rise to
payments with respect to the performance of services that are nondeductible
under Sections 162(m), 404 or 280G of the Code or subject to the excise Tax
under Section 4999 of the Code, and neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either
alone or upon occurrence of any additional event) result in the payment of any
amount that could, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code). There is no 



Company Benefit Arrangement or other Contract by which the Company is bound to
compensate any employee of the Company or other service provider of the
Company for any excise Tax or related interest or penalty paid pursuant to
Section 4999 of the Code.

No representation or warranty contained in this Section 3.7, with the
exception of Sections 3.7(a)(v), (c)(i), the first two sentences of Section
3.7(c)(ii), (c)(iii), (c)(viii), (c)(x), and (d), shall be deemed to apply
directly or indirectly with respect to any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
representations are made as to the amount of, or limitations on the use after
the Closing of, any net operating losses, built-in losses, capital losses,
deductions, Tax credits or other similar Tax attributes of the Company, in
each case, available for use after the Closing.

3.8 Related Party Transactions. Except (a) for employment relationships, (b)
for the payment of compensation and benefits in the Ordinary Course of
Business, (c) for any Contract related to the ownership of any Company Capital
Stock or Company Options, or (d) as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 3.8 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company is not a party to any Contract with, or
indebted, either directly or indirectly, to any of its officers or directors,
any holder of more than one percent (1%) of Company Capital Stock (or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any relatives or Affiliates of any such Person) in
effect as of the Agreement Date. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not have outstanding any loans to
any of its officers or directors, any holder of more than one percent (1%) of
Company Capital Stock (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any relatives or
Affiliates of any such Person). The Company has never, and has never been
deemed to have for purposes of any Law, in any transaction with any of its
officers, directors, employees, or any holder of more than one percent (1%) of
Company Capital Stock (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any member of the
immediate families of any such Person), acquired or retained the use of
property for proceeds greater than the fair market value thereof. The Company
has never, and has never been deemed to have for purposes of any Law, in a
transaction with any Affiliate of the Company where the Company (A) disposed
of property for proceeds less than the fair market value thereof or (B)
performed services for consideration other than the fair market value thereof.
To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the officers, directors and employees
of the Company, and no record or beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more
of any class of Company Capital Stock, nor any immediate family member of an
officer, director, employee or such beneficial owner, has a direct ownership
interest of more than five percent (5%) of the equity ownership of any firm or
corporation that does business with, or has any contractual arrangement with,
the Company.

be taken into account in the calculation of the Adjusted Transaction Value.
All reserves established by the Company that are set forth in or reflected in
the Company Balance Sheet have been established in accordance with GAAP and
are adequate as of the date of the Company Balance Sheet. The Company does not
have any "off-balance sheet arrangement" within the meaning of Item 303 of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Neither the Company nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any representative of the Company has received or 



otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,

auditing practices and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there have been no

are reflected on the Company Balance Sheet to the extent required under GAAP

the Company Business. All machinery, vehicles, equipment and other tangible
personal property owned or leased by the Company or used in the Company
Business are in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. All
leases of real or personal property to which the Company is a party are fully
effective and afford the Company a valid leasehold possession of the real or
personal property that is the subject of the lease, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances. All rents, required deposits and additional rents which are due
under the terms of the leases have been paid in full. The Company has never
owned any real property. Schedule 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets

which the Company is a party.

3.14 Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all (i) Registered Company Intellectual Property
Rights, and (ii) material unregistered Marks owned or purported to be owned
by, or exclusively licensed to, the Company, in each case as of the Agreement
Date. For each item of Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights,
Schedule 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists (A) the record owner
of such item, and, if different, the legal owner and beneficial owner of such
item, (B) the jurisdiction in which such item is issued, registered or

Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights in full force and effect.
There are no renewals, annuities, payments, fees, responses to office actions
or other filings required to be made and having a due date with respect to any
Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights within 120 days after the
Agreement Date. No issuance or registration obtained and no application filed
by the Company for any Intellectual Property Rights has been cancelled,
abandoned, allowed to lapse or not renewed, except where the Company has, in
its reasonable business judgment, decided to cancel, abandon, allow to lapse
or not renew such issuance, registration or application. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has claimed any status in the application for or
registration of any Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights, including
"small business status," that would not be applicable to Parent and/or
Surviving Corporation. Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights are,
and, as of and immediately following the Closing, will be subsisting,
enforceable, and, to the Company's Knowledge, valid, and, to the Company
Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would render any
Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights invalid or unenforceable.

(c) The Company is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and
interest in and to (i) all Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights and
(ii) all other Company Intellectual Property Rights and Company Technology
owned or purported to be owned by the Company as of the Agreement Date
(clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the "Owned Company IP"), free and clear of
all Encumbrances. The Company has the sole and exclusive right to bring a
claim or suit against a third party for infringement or misappropriation of
Owned Company IP. The Company has not (i) transferred to any Person ownership
of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Intellectual
Property Rights that are or would have been, but for such transfer or grant,
Company Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) permitted the rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Intellectual Property Rights that
are or were, at the time, material Company Intellectual Property Rights to
lapse or enter into the public domain except where the Company has, in its
reasonable business judgment, decided to permit such result. No Company
Intellectual Property Rights or Technology are subject to any claim,
proceeding or outstanding decree, order, judgment, or stipulation or Contract
restricting in any material manner, the use, transfer, or licensing thereof by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which may affect the validity, use
or enforceability of such Company Intellectual Property Rights or Technology.
All Company Intellectual Property Rights and Company Technology that are not
Owned Company IP ("Licensed IP") are validly licensed to the Company pursuant
to (A) Intellectual Property Licenses contained in the Contracts listed on
Schedule 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (B) Open Source Software
listed in Schedule 3.14(o) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (C) Non-
Negotiated Vendor Contracts that have been made available to Parent. The
Company has (and will continue to have immediately following the Closing)
valid and continuing rights (under such Contracts) to use, sell, license and
otherwise exploit, as the case may be, all Licensed IP as the same are
currently used, sold, licensed and otherwise exploited by the Company, subject
to the terms of the applicable Contracts. 



(d) All Owned Company IP is fully and freely transferable and assignable and
may be transferred and assigned to Parent without restriction and without
payment of any kind to any third Person.

(e) The Owned Company IP and the Licensed IP constitute all of the
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology that are used in or are necessary,
and are sufficient, to enable the Company to conduct the Company Business,
including the design, development, manufacture, use, marketing, import for
resale, distribution, licensing out and sale of any Company Offering. For
clarity, the only Company representations with respect to the actual or
alleged infringement of any third party Intellectual Property are set forth in
Section 3.14(i).

(f) None of the Registered Company Intellectual Property Rights have been or
are subject to any interference, derivation, reexamination (including ex parte
reexamination, inter partes reexamination, inter partes review, post grant
review or Covered Business Method (CBM) review), cancellation, or opposition
proceeding.

(g) Schedule 3.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
correct list of all Intellectual Property Licenses granted expressly under
Patents (i) from another Person to the Company, and (ii) from the Company to
another Person in effect as of the Agreement Date.

(h) Copies of the Company's standard form(s) of non-disclosure agreement and
the Company's standard form(s), including attachments, of non-exclusive
licenses of, or agreements to provide on a non-exclusive basis, Company
Offerings to customers have been made available to Parent.

(i) Neither the conduct of the Company Business nor any Company Offering
(including the design, development, use, practice, offering, licensing,
provision, import, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing, sale,
distribution, making available, or other exploitation of any Company Offering)
(i) has been or is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, using or disclosing
without authorization, or otherwise violating (and, when conducted following
the Closing in substantially the same manner, will not infringe,
misappropriate, dilute, use or disclose without authorization, or otherwise
violate) any Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person, or (ii) has

Closing in substantially the same manner, will not contribute to or induce)
any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of any Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person, or (iii) has been or is constituting
(and, when conducted following the Closing in substantially the same manner,

Code and the regulations thereunder) would receive any payment or benefit that
would reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations thereunder),
then, the Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
each such "disqualified individual" a waiver in substantially the form
attached to the Agreement as Exhibit F (the "Parachute Payment Waiver") of

individual" who has executed a Parachute Payment Waiver to receive the Waived

as a result, no Waived 280G Benefits payable by the Company shall be made or

termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 8,
Parent covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:

6.1 Advise of Changes. Parent shall promptly advise the Company in writing of
(a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would render any
representation or warranty of Parent or

Sub pursuant to this Agreement, any Parent Ancillary Agreement or any Merger
Sub Ancillary Agreement.

municipal, which may be required in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Parent
Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement. Without prejudice

Act or any other antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5)

response in compliance with such request. The Parent shall consult with and
cooperate with the Company in advance of any such written or oral
communication to any Governmental Authority, and shall not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect
of investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
unless it consults with the Company in advance and, except as prohibited by
applicable Law or Governmental Authority, gives Parent the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. The Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided

Agreement as violative of any Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be under any
obligation to: (a) litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action

its obligations to each present and former director and officer of the Company
(collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any

pursuant to any indemnification Contract between the Company and such Company
Indemnified Party listed in Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in each case with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the

the Surviving Corporation (i) shall be subject to any limitation imposed by
applicable Law, (ii) shall not be deemed to release any Company Indemnified

his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Company Ancillary
Agreement and (iii) shall not limit in any way the terms of the resignation
letter and release delivered by such Company Indemnified Party in connection
with the Closing.

Indemnified Parties than are as set forth in the Charter Documents of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement. Any indemnification agreements with
the Company Indemnified Parties in existence on the date of this Agreement, as
set forth on Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without any further action, and
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance

amended or waived without the written consent of any affected Company
Indemnified Party.

employees of the Company prior to such presentation, and Parent shall consider

Consent, at any time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written consent
of Parent and the Company.

8.2 Unilateral Termination.

(a) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued a final judgment or taken any action
(and the final appeal of such judgment or action has been denied) having the
effect of permanently restraining or enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger or any other material transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
11:59 p.m. Pacific time on November 30, 2018 if the conditions to the
terminating party's obligations to Closing under Article 7 have not been
satisfied and the terminating party has not waived such unsatisfied conditions
by such date other than conditions pertaining to covenants to be performed as
part of effectuating the Closing; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall not be
available to any party 



whose breach of a representation or warranty or covenant made under this
Agreement by such party results in the failure of any condition set forth in
Article 7 to be fulfilled or satisfied on or before such date.

(c) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if the other
has committed a breach of (i) any of its representations or warranties under
Article 3 or Article 4, as applicable, or (ii) any of its covenants under
Article 5 or Article 6, as applicable, and (A) has not cured such breach
within 30 days after the party seeking to terminate this Agreement has given
the other party written notice of such breach and its intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) (provided, however, that no
such cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by
its nature cannot be cured) and (B) if not cured on or prior to the Closing
Date, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Article 7 to be fulfilled or satisfied; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.2(c) shall not be
available to a party if such party is at that time in material breach of this
Agreement.

Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if any event has occurred or
any circumstance exists which, alone or together with any one or more other
events or circumstances has had, is having or would reasonably be expected to

(e) Parent, by giving written notice to the Company, may terminate this
Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if the Stockholder Consent,
executed by Company Stockholders that represent the Stockholder Approval, is
not delivered to Parent within one (1) hour after the execution of this
Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative; provided,
however, that this termination right shall no longer apply and shall expire if
not invoked by Parent prior to actual delivery of the Stockholder Consent
evidencing the Stockholder Approval.

8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the

shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from
Liability in connection with any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or willful breach.

ARTICLE 9 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES, 
CONTINUING COVENANTS

of the Company contained in Article 3 of this Agreement (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Letter) and the Company Certificates shall survive the
Effective Time and remain in full force and effect until the Expiration Date;
provided, however, that: (a) the Specified Representations will remain
operative and in full force and effect until the 60th day following the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of
such representation (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not mean the
statute of limitations applicable to a claim for breach of contract), (b) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.14 (Intellectual
Property) (the "IP Representations") will remain operative and in full force
and effect until the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date, (c) no

Article 9 in respect of any claim based upon any failure of a representation

delivered in accordance with Section 9.4 prior to the applicable expiration
date of such representation or warranty shall be affected by the expiration of
such representation 



or warranty, and (d) such expiration shall not affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party, under this Article 9 or otherwise, to seek recovery of
Damages arising out of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or willful breach until the 60th day following the expiration of
the statute of limitations applicable to such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or willful breach. The representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and the
certificates to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.3 shall terminate at the
Effective Time. All covenants of the parties (including the covenants set
forth in Article 5 and Article 6) shall remain operative and in full force and
effect until the 60th day following the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to the subject matter of such covenant; provided,
however, that no right to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
pursuant to this Article 9 in respect of any claim based upon any breach of a
covenant set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered prior to the 60th day
following the applicable expiration date of such covenant shall be affected by
the expiration of such covenant.

9.2 Company Securityholder Agreement to Indemnify. Each Company Securityholder
(each, an "Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties")
shall severally (based on each such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Escrow Share
with respect to the Escrow Amount and otherwise based on each such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Indemnity Share), and not jointly, indemnify and
hold harmless each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, agents, representatives and employees (each
hereinafter referred to individually as an "Indemnified Party" and
collectively as the "Indemnified Parties") from and against, and shall
compensate and reimburse each of them for, any and all losses, costs
(including re-engineering costs), damages, lost profits, Liabilities, interest
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, other professionals' and
experts' fees and court costs incurred in connection with investigating,
defending against or settling any of the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively
referred to as "Damages") incurred by an Indemnified Party, directly or
indirectly, and whether arising out of a Third-Party Claim or a direct claim,
arising out of or resulting from:

(a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article 2 of this Agreement (as modified or supplemented by the Company
Disclosure Letter) to be true and correct as of the Agreement Date or as of
the Closing Date (as though such representation or warranty were made as of
the Closing Date rather than the Agreement Date, except in the case of any
individual representation and warranty which by its terms speaks only as of a
specific date or dates, in which case as though made as of such specific date
or dates) and any failure of any certification made by the Company in the
Company Certificates to be true and correct as of the date such certificate
shall be delivered to Parent (the "Company Representation Indemnities");

(b) any breach of, or default in connection with, any of the covenants of or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement and any failure of any
certification made by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(b) to be true and

Aggregate Exercise Price, Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Cash Amount or the
Unpaid Transaction Fees (including the Closing Employee Payments);

(d) any claim asserted by any current, former or alleged securityholder
(including any current, former or alleged holder of options) of the Company
(whether against the Company, Parent, any Affiliate of the Company or Parent,
or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the
foregoing) (i) relating to this Agreement, any other agreement entered into in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) alleging any ownership of or interest in
any shares or other securities of the Company that is not specifically
disclosed in the Spreadsheet or (iii) that is in any way inconsistent with, or
that involves an allegation of facts inconsistent with, any of 



the information set forth in Section 3.4, in Schedule 3.4 of the Company
Disclosure Letter or in the Spreadsheet;

(e) the exercise by any Company Stockholder of appraisal rights or dissenters'
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the
CGCL, including any payment made with respect to any Dissenting Share to the
extent that such payment exceeds the value of the amount that otherwise would
have been payable pursuant to Article 2 upon the exchange of such Dissenting
Share;

(f) any Indemnified Taxes;

(g) any Action pending against the Company (or against any officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company in their capacity as such or relating to
their employment, services or relationship with the Company) as of the
Effective Time;

(h) any failure by the Representative to perform or comply, or otherwise act
in accordance with, any covenant, agreement or any other provision applicable
to the Representative contained in this Agreement;

(i) any Liabilities relating to or arising out of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

(j) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or willful breach on the part of (A) any securityholder of the
Company, (B) the Company or (C) any Company Representative in connection with
or relating directly or indirectly to (1) the negotiation, execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement (2) any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (3) the due diligence investigation conducted by Parent and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
other representatives with respect to the Company;

(k) any matter referred to in Schedule 9.2(k) of the Company Disclosure
Letter; and

(l) subject to Section 9.5, any Third-Party Claim alleging the occurrence of
facts or circumstances or raising claims that, if assumed to be true, would
otherwise entitle an Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder, including
the costs and expenses incurred or paid by any Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees, costs of
investigation and court or arbitration costs), regardless of the resolution of
such Third-Party Claim.

9.3 Limitations.

(a) In the case of a claim with respect to (i) any of the Company
Representation Indemnities or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.2(l) in connection
with a Third Party Claim to the extent related to the Company Representation
Indemnities, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
source of recovery of the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, if any
Damages arising out of or resulting from (i) (A) any failure of any of the IP
Representations to be true and correct as set forth in Section 9.2(a) or (B)
any Third Party Claim to the extent related to the IP Representations
(collectively, "IP Claims"), (ii) (A) any failure of any of the Specified
Representations to be true and correct as set forth in Section 9.2(a) or (B)
any Third Party Claim to the extent related to the Specified Representations,
(iii) (A) any of clauses (b) through (k) of Section 9.2 or (B) any Third Party
Claim to the extent related to clauses (b) through (k) of Section 9.2, and
(iv) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or willful
breach (clauses (ii) - (iv), collectively, "Special Matters") are recovered
from and thereby reduce the Escrow Amount, 



claims that are not IP Claims or Special Matters and that would otherwise be
limited to recovery from the Escrow Fund may, to the extent not recoverable
from any then remaining Escrow Amount, instead be recovered to the extent of
the amount of such reduction(s) from the respective Indemnifying Parties
(severally and not jointly in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Indemnity Shares); provided, further, that claims for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or willful breach may, at Parent's
discretion, be asserted directly against the Indemnifying Party who committed,
participated in or had actual knowledge of such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or willful breach (a "Bad Act Claim").

(b) In the case of any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement arising out of or resulting from (i) any IP Claim, each
Indemnifying Party shall be severally (as determined in accordance with
Section 9.2(a)) and not jointly liable, in addition to any amount recovered
from the Escrow Fund, for such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Indemnity Share
of any Damages resulting therefrom up to an aggregate amount equal to the sum
of $9,600,000 plus the Escrow Fund Release Amount; or (ii) any Special Matter,
each Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not jointly liable, in addition
to any amount recovered from the Escrow Fund, for such Indemnifying Party's
Pro Rata Indemnity Share of any Damages resulting therefrom up to the portion
of the Aggregate Cash Consideration paid or payable to such Indemnifying Party
pursuant to Article 2 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of
the Aggregate Cash Consideration retained by Parent pursuant to the terms of
any Support Agreement). The Escrow Fund shall be exhausted before an
Indemnified makes any claim for Damages directly against an Indemnifying
Party, provided, that, in the case of a Bad Act Claim, the Indemnified Parties
may elect, in their sole discretion and preference order, to assert
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement claims against the Escrow Fund
and/or directly against the applicable Indemnifying Party who committed,
participated in or had actual knowledge of such Bad Act Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be no maximum
liability with respect to claims for fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
willful misconduct or willful breach in respect of any Indemnifying Party who
committed, participated in or had actual knowledge of such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or willful breach, and nothing herein
shall limit or prevent the bringing of any such claim.

(d) No Indemnified Party may receive any portion of the Escrow Fund in respect
of any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that is made
(i) pursuant to the Company Representation Indemnities or (ii) pursuant to
Section 9.2(l) in connection with a Third Party Claim to the extent related to
the Company Representation Indemnities (in each case except for any such
claims or Third Party Claims (i) with respect to any Specified Representations
or (ii) which involve fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct
or willful breach), unless and until Damages in the aggregate under all claims
that have been incurred, paid or properly accrued exceed $625,000 (the
"Basket"), in which case the Indemnified Parties may recover all Damages,
including the amount of the Basket. Solely in determining the amount of any
Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be true
and correct as of any particular date, any materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualification limiting the scope of such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of
calculating or determining the amount of Damages incurred under Section 9.2,
there shall be deducted from any Damages an amount equal to the amount of any
proceeds actually received by any Indemnified Party from any third-party
insurer in connection with such Damages (after giving effect to any deductible
or retention or increase in premium associated therewith to the extent paid or
payable and net of any costs, Taxes and expenses of recovery or collection
thereof); provided, however, that none of the Indemnified Parties shall have
any obligation to (i) seek recovery against any insurance policies, or (ii)
obtain insurance coverage or other third party protection with respect to any
particular matter. 



(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery for any
adjustments to the Merger Consideration provided for hereunder or for any
indemnifiable Damages even though such Damages may have resulted from the
breach of more than one of the representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants in this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any party be liable to the other for any exemplary
or punitive damages (except to the extent such exemplary or punitive damages
are awarded to a third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim).

(h) The rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement set forth in
this Agreement based on the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
and obligations set forth herein shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted by Parent, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
at any time (whether before or after the Agreement Date or the Closing Date),
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.

9.4 Notice of Claim.

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement of an Indemnified Party for Damages under this
Article 9.

(b) An Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Damages pursuant to this Article
9 by delivering written notice, executed by an authorized representative of
such Indemnified Party (a "Notice of Claim"), to the Representative (with a
copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery against the Escrow
Fund) of any Claim arising from or resulting from any matter specified in
Section 9.2, including in respect of the assertion of any Action by a third
party (a "Third-Party Claim").

(c) No delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in giving the Representative
a Notice of Claim (or any update or amendment thereto after conducting
discovery regarding the underlying facts and circumstances set forth therein)
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Article 9 unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Parties
are prejudiced thereby, including with respect to the amount of Damages for
which the Indemnifying Parties are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party.

9.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

(a) The Indemnified Party shall determine and conduct the investigation,
defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that if the
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the Representative is not obtained to any settlement of a Third
Party Claim that the Indemnified Party alleges is a Full Recovery Claim (as
defined below), such settlement shall not be dispositive as to whether such
Third-Party Claim is a Full Recovery Claim or the amount of Damages associated
with such Third-Party Claim.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, solely with respect to a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(l) (and not any other
subsection of Section 9.2), only fifty percent (50%) of the Damages of any
Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting from such Third-Party Claim
shall be included as Damages for which an Indemnified Party is indemnified
hereunder (for the avoidance of doubt, however, one hundred percent (100%) of
such Damages shall constitute Damages that have been incurred, paid or
properly accrued for purposes of the Basket); provided, however, that if and
to the extent that the Indemnified Party can show that the allegations
contained in such Third-Party Claim, together with 



any other relevant facts and circumstances, would reasonably be expected to
entitle an Indemnified Party to indemnification under any of Sections 9.2(a)
through (k), the foregoing limitation shall not apply and one hundred percent
(100%) of the Damages of any Indemnified Party arising out of or resulting
from such Third-Party Claim shall be included in the Damages for which an
Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder (a "Full Recovery Claim").

(c) The Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with the third-party claimant with
respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents
by the Representative does not adversely affect any privilege relating to the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall provide the Representative
the opportunity to consult with and participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, any defense of the Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to the Third-Party Claim, all at the sole expense of the
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties).

9.6 Contents of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Party
given pursuant to Section 9.4 shall contain the following information: (a)
that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly incurred, paid or
properly accrued or believes it may have to directly or indirectly incur, pay
or accrue, Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim
(which amount may be an estimated amount or may be the amount of Damages
claimed by a third party in a Third-Party Claim); and (b) a brief description,
in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to such Indemnified
Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Damages based on such Indemnified Party's belief thereof, including, to the
extent reasonably available to such Indemnified Party: (i) the identity and
address of any third-party claimant, (ii) copies of any formal demand or
complaint and (iii) the specific nature of the breach or other item of
indemnification to which such item is related; provided, however, that the
Notice of Claim may be updated and amended from time to time by the
Indemnified Party by delivering an updated or amended Notice of Claim to the
Representative, so long as the delivery of the original Notice of Claim is
made within the applicable claims period and such update or amendment only
asserts bases for liability or Damages reasonably related to the underlying
facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original Notice of
Claim; provided, further, that all Claims for Damages properly set forth in
the original Notice of Claim or any permitted update or amendment thereto
shall remain outstanding until such Claims for Damages have been finally
resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration of such claims period.

9.7 Resolution of Notice of Claim.

(a) Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnified Party shall be resolved as
follows:

(i) Uncontested Claims. If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim is received
by the Representative, the Representative does not contest such Notice of
Claim in writing to the Indemnified Party (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if
the Claim involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) as provided in Section
9.7(a)(ii), the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have consented,
on behalf of all Indemnifying Parties, to the recovery by the Indemnified
Party of the full amount of Damages (subject to the limitations contained in
this Article 9) specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this
Article 9, including the forfeiture of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund,
and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final
judgment for damages against the Indemnifying Parties for such amount in any
court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

(ii) Contested Claims. If the Representative gives the Indemnified Party
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a
"Contested Claim") (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves
recovery against the Escrow Fund) within the 30-day period specified in
Section 9.7(a)(i), then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (A) a
written settlement agreement 



executed by Parent and the Representative (a copy of which shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) or
(B) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 30 days
following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the written notice from the
Representative, by binding litigation between Parent and the Representative in
accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 9.7(b).

(b) Litigation of Contested Claims. In accordance with Section 11.1, either
Parent or the Representative may bring suit in the courts of the State of
Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located within
the State of Delaware to resolve a Contested Claim. The decision of the trial
court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Notice of Claim shall
be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement,
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, and the
Escrow Agent, all of whom shall be obligated to act in accordance with such
decision and, if applicable, make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund
in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The non-prevailing party to a
suit shall pay its own expenses and the expenses, including attorneys' fees
and documented out-of-pocket costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to
the suit.

(c) Payment of Claims. If any amount is determined, agreed or deemed agreed to
be owed to any Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section 9.7, then
(i) within three Business Days following the date such amount is determined,
agreed or deemed agreed to be owed, Parent and the Representative shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release such amount to the Indemnified Party from the
Escrow Fund (if and to the extent such amount is to be recovered from the
Escrow Fund), and (ii) if the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the full amount that is determined, agreed or deemed
agreed to be owed to such Indemnified Party, or if such amount is otherwise to
be recovered directly from the Indemnifying Parties, then, subject to the
limitations contained in Section 9.3, each Indemnifying Party shall, within 10
Business Days following the date such amount is determined, agreed or deemed
agreed to be owed, pay such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Indemnity Share of
the amount of such shortfall or direct recovery to such Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall be
entitled to offset against or deduct from any amount of the Aggregate Cash
Consideration retained by Parent pursuant to the terms of any Indemnifying
Party's Support Agreement that has become, or in the future becomes, earned
and due and payable from Parent or any of its Affiliates to such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to such Support Agreement in full or partial satisfaction of
any Damages recoverable directly from such Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement.

9.8 Release of Remaining Escrow Fund. Within five Business Days following the
Expiration Date, Parent and the Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent, subject to Section 9.9, to deliver to each Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to (i) such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Escrow Share, multiplied by
(ii) all of funds in the Escrow Fund (if any) in excess of any amounts in the
Escrow Fund that may be necessary to satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed Claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the
Representative before the Expiration Date (based on the total maximum amount
of Damages then being claimed in good faith by Indemnified Parties in such
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims). If any Claim is unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed as of the Expiration Date, then the Escrow Agent shall
retain possession and custody of that portion of the Escrow Fund that equals
the total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed in good faith by
Indemnified Parties in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims,
and as soon as each such Claim is resolved, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to
Section 9.9, deliver to each Indemnifying Party an amount equal to (A) such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Escrow Share, multiplied by (B) the portion of
the Escrow Fund that is not being retained in respect of remaining unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed Claims. The aggregate amount that is released to the
Company 



Securityholders (or to the Representative pursuant to Section 9.13) from the
Escrow Fund shall be referred to as the "Escrow Fund Release Amount".

9.9 Payment Conditions. With respect to any amount to be released from the
Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount pursuant to Sections 9.8 or 9.13(d) or
any amounts to be paid to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.3(e):

(a) if any Indemnifying Party who held shares of Company Capital Stock has not
executed and delivered a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and
surrendered such Person's Certificate(s) in accordance with Section 2.7 or
complied with Section 2.7(c) with respect to any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate (the "Payment Conditions") prior to the date on which any amount
is to be distributed from the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount or to be
paid to such Indemnifying Party, then any amount that would otherwise be
released or paid to such Indemnifying Party shall be held by the Exchange
Agent, without interest, until such Indemnifying Party satisfies all
applicable Payment Conditions; and

(b) unless the Representative provides updated payment delivery instructions,
each distribution to be made from the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund Amount,
and each payment to be made by Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(e) to a
particular Indemnifying Party shall be effected in accordance with the payment
delivery instructions set forth in such Person's Letter of Transmittal.

9.10 Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments. All payments (if any) made
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement obligations under this Article 9 will be treated as adjustments
to the purchase price for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern
for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Law.

9.11 No Right of Contribution. No Indemnifying Party or the Representative
acting on their behalf shall make any claim for indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement or contribution from Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate, assign or successor of any of the foregoing with
respect to any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement claims arising
under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement hereunder for such claim, it being acknowledged
and agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Company are solely for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.

9.12 Exclusive Remedy. Following the Closing, except as contemplated by
Section 11.5, the rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
provided by Section 9.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Damages
of any Indemnified Party with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the
Company or with respect to any of the matters set forth in Section 9.2.

9.13 Appointment of Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, executing and
delivering a Support Agreement or participating in the Merger and receiving
the benefits thereof, each Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have approved
the designation of and hereby designates the Representative as the
representative of the Indemnifying Parties and as the attorney-in-fact and
exclusive agent for and on behalf of each Indemnifying Party with respect to
Claims under this Article 9 and the taking by the Representative of any and
all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken
by the Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative Engagement Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement to
which such Indemnifying Party is a party in its capacity as an Indemnifying
Party, including the exercise of the power to: (i) give and receive notices
and communications to or from (on behalf 



of itself or any other Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any Company Ancillary Agreement to which
such Indemnifying Party is a party in its capacity as a Indemnifying Party, or
any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby
(except to the extent that this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Company
Ancillary Agreement to which such Indemnifying Party is a party in its
capacity as a Indemnifying Party expressly contemplates that any such notice
or communication shall be given or received by such Indemnifying Party
individually), (ii) authorize the release or delivery to Parent of all or a
portion of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of Claims by Parent or any other
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9 (including by not objecting to
such Claims), (iii) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into
settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to (A) Claims by Parent or any other Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article 9 or (B) any dispute between any Indemnified Party
and any such Indemnifying Party, in each case, relating to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each
Indemnifying Party with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Claims under this Article 9 and all rights or obligations
arising under this Article 9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, except as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in
the Representative Engagement Agreement. The Indemnifying Parties shall be
bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Representative in
connection with this Article 9, and Parent and the other Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Representative. The
Indemnifying Parties recognize and intend that the power of attorney granted
in this Section 9.13(a) and the powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Representative Group hereunder: (1) are coupled
with an interest and are irrevocable; (2) may be delegated by the
Representative; (3) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution,
liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of each of the Indemnifying Parties and
shall be binding on any successor thereto; and (4) shall survive the delivery
of any assignment by any Indemnifying Party of the whole or any fraction of
his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund. Each Indemnifying Party (aa)
agrees that all actions taken by the Representative under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon such Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnifying Party's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Indemnifying Party and (bb) waives any and all defenses which
may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Representative
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Representative shall only have the
duties expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have no other duty,
express or implied, and for the purposes of clarity there are no obligations
of the Representative in any Company Ancillary Agreement, schedule, exhibit or
the Company Disclosure Letter. The Representative may engage attorneys,
accountants and other professionals and experts. The Representative may in
good faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and
opinions prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by
the Representative based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have
been taken in good faith. In addition, the Representative may rely on the
Spreadsheet, on any signature believed by it to be genuine, and reasonably
assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the
applicable Indemnifying Party or other party. Parent may conclusively rely,
without independent verification or investigation, upon any action of the
Representative as being the binding decision or action of the Indemnifying
Parties, and Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnifying Party or any other
Person for any actions taken or omitted from being taken by them or by Parent
in accordance with or reliance upon any decision or action of the
Representative. The Person serving as the Representative may resign at any
time, and may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund then on deposit with the Escrow Agent upon not
less than 10 Business Days' prior written notice to Parent and the Escrow
Agent. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Representative or any member of the Advisory
Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow 



Agreement. No bond shall be required of the Representative. Notices or
communications to or from the Representative shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Indemnifying Parties.

(b) Each Indemnifying Party hereby authorizes Parent to withhold the Expense
Fund Amount from the amounts otherwise payable by Parent to the Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.2(a), with
Parent to withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each
Indemnifying Party and deliver to the Representative an amount equal to each
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Indemnity Share of the Expense Fund Amount.
Certain Indemnifying Parties have entered into an engagement agreement (the
"Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Representative to provide
direction to the Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative Engagement Agreement
(such Indemnifying Parties, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). In performing
the functions specified in this Agreement, the Representative Engagement
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, neither the Representative nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Representative Group"),
shall be liable to any Indemnifying Party in the absence of gross negligence
or willful breach on the part of the Representative. Each Indemnifying Party
shall severally (based on each such Indemnifying Party's respective Pro Rata
Indemnity Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the
Representative Group from and against any loss, liability damage, claim, fee,
judgment, amount paid in settlement, fine or expense, including costs of
counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers, incurred without gross negligence or willful breach on
the part of the Representative Group and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement and under the Representative Engagement Agreement, including any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs
reasonably incurred by the Representative Group (together, the "Representative
Expenses"). If not paid directly to the Representative by the Indemnifying
Parties, such Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Representative,
first, from the Expense Fund Amount, second, from any distribution of the
Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Indemnifying Parties. The
Indemnifying Parties acknowledge that the Representative shall not be required
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges
or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Representative shall not be required to
take any action unless the Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Representative in performing such actions.

(c) The Representative represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of
the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as follows: (i) the
Representative is a limited liability company, duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
any other applicable Contract, instrument or document contemplated hereby and
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, (ii) the execution,
delivery and performance by the Representative of this Agreement and any other
applicable Contract, instrument or document contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by the Representative and no other act or proceeding on
the part of the Representative or its equity holders is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other
applicable Contract, instrument or document contemplated hereby, (iii) this
Agreement and any other applicable Contract, instrument or document
contemplated hereby has been duly executed and delivered by the Representative
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Representative,
enforceable in accordance with its terms and (iv) neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other applicable Contract,
instrument or document contemplated hereby by the Representative nor the
consummation of the 



Merger will conflict with, or result in a termination, breach, impairment or
violation of, the organizational or other governing documents of the
Representative, or any applicable Law or Contract to which the Representative
or its assets or properties is bound.

(d) Upon the payment of the Expense Fund Amount by Parent or its designee to
the segregated client bank account maintained by the Representative for the
Expense Fund Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(c), each Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have contributed his, her or its Pro Rata Indemnity Share of the
Expense Fund Amount. The Representative shall hold the Expense Fund Amount in
accordance with this Agreement on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties as a fund
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the
Representative Engagement Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) as
otherwise directed by the Advisory Group. The Representative is not providing
any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund
Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund Amount, and has no tax reporting
or income distribution obligations. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the
Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund Amount from any
consideration otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties. The
Indemnifying Parties will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense
Fund Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith. The Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable
following the release in full of the Escrow Fund, the Representative will
deliver the balance of the Expense Fund Amount to the Exchange Agent, subject
to Section 9.9, for further distribution to the Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Indemnity Shares. For Tax purposes,
the Expense Fund Amount will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties at the time of Closing (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, (1) Tax withholding, if any, with respect to such
deemed contribution by any Indemnifying Party shall be satisfied from such
Indemnifying Party's share of the Merger Consideration payable to such
Indemnifying Party on the Closing Date and shall not reduce the Expense Fund
Amount, and (2) any portion of the Expense Fund Amount remaining that is
returned to an Indemnifying Party shall not be subject to information
reporting or Tax withholding).

ARTICLE 10 
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Tax Returns; Tax Matters

(a) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company that are required
to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date,
and the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company due
on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating
items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Company with respect to such items, except as required by applicable Law.
At least 15 days prior to filing any such Tax Return, the Company shall submit
a copy of any such Tax Return that is an income Tax Return, along with
supporting work papers, to Parent for Parent's review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, at the Company Stockholders'
expense, prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company
after the Closing Date with respect to 



Pre-Closing Tax Periods, which Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items
on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company with respect to such items, except as required by applicable Law.
Parent shall provide the Representative with a copy of each such proposed Tax
Return that is an income Tax Return or a Tax Return that shows a material
amount of Tax due (and such additional information regarding such Return as
may reasonably be requested by the Representative in writing) and permit the
Representative, at the Company Stockholders' expense, to review and comment on
each such Tax Return, and Parent shall submit all such Tax Returns to the
Representative at least 20 days (or as soon as is reasonably practicable with
respect to such Tax Returns that are non-income Tax Returns) prior to the due
dates for such Tax Returns. Parent shall make all reasonable changes as
requested by the Representative with respect to such Tax Returns that are
income Tax Returns or Tax Returns that show a material amount of Tax due. If
Parent does not receive comments from the Representative at least five days
prior to the filing of such Tax Returns, the Representative shall be deemed to
have no comments to such Tax Returns.

(c) Not later than 10 days prior to the due date of the payment of Taxes on
any Tax Returns which Parent has the responsibility to cause to be filed
pursuant to Section 10.1(b), without duplication of, or prejudice to, the
Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
under Section 9.2, Parent shall be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Fund
an amount equal to the costs of preparing such Tax Returns plus the amount of
Indemnified Taxes, as reasonably determined by Parent, due in respect of such
Tax Returns. For purposes of this Agreement, costs of preparing such Tax
Returns shall include any costs relating to any studies and/or reports
necessary to substantiate and/or validate any Tax credits claimed or reported
on such Tax Returns, provided that for the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable
costs shall not include any costs incurred in evaluating the availability of
net operating losses, Tax credits or other similar Tax attributes for use in a
taxable period ending after the Closing Date.

(d) Except as authorized in Section 10.1(e) solely with respect to the Taxes
referenced in that provision, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
(and shall not permit their respective Affiliates to) (i) amend any Tax
Returns of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) cause
the Company to make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any Tax
Return for a Pre- Closing Tax Period, or (iii) agree to extend or waive the
statute of limitations with respect Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except, in each case, with the prior written consent of the
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), or as required or permitted pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or
Section 10.1(e).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without
duplication of, or prejudice to, the Indemnified Parties' rights to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9.2, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to file, initiate and/or enter
into any voluntary disclosure or similar agreements with Tax authorities
regarding the Company's unpaid sales, use, gross receipts or similar Taxes for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods without the prior written consent or approval of the
Representative; provided that, Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall use good faith efforts to minimize the Taxes
which are the subject of such voluntary disclosure or similar agreements in
the preparation, filing, negotiation and settlement with respect thereto. For
the avoidance of doubt, any costs and expenses, including professional fees,
incurred in connection with such voluntary disclosure or similar agreements
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 9.2.

10.2 Cooperation. Parent and the Representative agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including access to books and
records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Parent or the Representative, the making of any election relating to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any Tax authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Parent,
the Company and the Representative shall (i) retain all books and records in
their possession with respect to 



Taxes until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods, and (ii) abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any taxing authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
herein to the contrary, including Section 9.5(b), in no event shall the
Representative be entitled to review or otherwise have access to any income
Tax Return, or information related thereto, of Parent or its Affiliates (other
than income Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods).

10.3 Tax Audits.

(a) If (A) notice of any Action with respect to Taxes of the Company (a "Tax
Contest"), (B) notice of an intent to commence any Tax Contest, or (C) notice
of deficiency, proposed adjustment, notice of assessment, or notice of lien
with respect to Taxes (whether claimed, proposed, asserted, or assessed) shall
be received by any party for which any other party may reasonably be expected
to be liable under this Agreement, the notified party shall provide such other
party or parties in writing a Notice of Claim; provided, however, that the
failure of the notified party to give any other party notice as provided
herein shall not relieve such other party of its indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement obligations under Article 9 or this Article 10 except to the
extent that such other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that a
provision of this Section 10.3 conflicts with any provision of Article 9, this
Section 10.3 shall govern.

(b) Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest of
the Company. To the extent a Tax Contest relates to Taxes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall (i) keep the Representative informed of
all developments on a timely basis, (ii) provide to the Representative copies
of any and all material correspondence from any Governmental Authority related
to such Tax Contest and all information reasonably requested by the
Representative regarding such Tax Contest, (iii) permit the Representative to
evaluate and comment on such Tax Contest, and reasonably and in good faith
consider any such comments of the Representative, (iv) provide the
Representative with the opportunity to attend conferences with the relevant
Governmental Authority (if reasonably practical) and to review and provide
comments with respect to written responses provided to the relevant
Governmental Authority and (v) not settle or otherwise compromise any such Tax
Contest if such settlement or other compromise could reasonably be expected to
give rise to an indemnification claim hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given
unless the Representative shall have objected within 30 days after written
request for such consent by Parent.

10.4 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, VAT and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") will be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Company Stockholders and fifty percent (50%) by Parent,
and each of the aforementioned parties shall indemnify the other party from
such Transfer Taxes paid by the other in excess of such threshold. The party
legally obligated to do so will file or cause to be filed in a timely manner
all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes. The Representative and Parent shall provide one another with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other party that any Transfer Taxes
payable by the Company Securityholders on one hand, and the Parent on the
other hand, have been paid (to the extent required by this Section 10.4).



ARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS 



11.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of
its conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (unless the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the
matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware) solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of any of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including resolution of disputes under Section 9.7(b)), and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware; provided that a judgment rendered by such court may be
enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 11.9 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect
to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the
State of Delaware.

11.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party
hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this
provision shall be void.

11.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including via facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), each
of which shall be an original as regards any party whose signature appears
thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts
hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of all
parties reflected hereon as signatories.

11.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any State having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 



11.6 Amendments and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by Parent, the Company and the
Representative. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto as provided in this Section 11.6 at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires the further
approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent may,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in any of the representations and warranties made to it
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained
herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless signed in
writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The
failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall not be
construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such
provisions.

11.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not
the Merger is successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective
legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and other expenses incurred
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, it being the intention of the parties that if the Merger is
consummated, the Unpaid Transaction Fees be taken into account in calculating
the Adjusted Transaction Value as set forth herein.

11.8 Attorneys' Fees. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any part
of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as an
element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys' fees to
be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal). The
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit, regardless of
whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

11.9 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, sent by electronic mail, sent by certified or
registered first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally
recognized express courier service, provided that notices to the
Representative shall be delivered solely by facsimile or electronic mail. Such
notices and other communications shall be effective upon receipt if hand
delivered or sent during normal business hours by facsimile (effective as of
the delivery of the facsimile confirmation) or electronic mail, three Business
Days after mailing if sent by mail, and one Business Day after dispatch if
sent by express courier or after receipt if not sent during normal business

complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby

of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each such party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each such
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each such party has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.10. 



11.11 Interpretation; Rules of Construction. The terms "hereof," "herein" and
similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), and when a reference
is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Sections or Articles, such
reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to, Section or Article of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The words "asset" or "property"
shall be construed as having the same meaning and effect and to refer to any
and all assets and properties, real and personal, tangible and intangible. The
word "fraud" shall be construed to mean intentional fraud. When a reference is
made to a specific Law, act or statute, such reference shall include any
regulations promulgated thereunder. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument, or statute, in
each case, as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented (in the case
of agreements or instruments, if permitted under this Agreement), including
(in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the
case of statutes) by succession or comparable successor statutes. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms
defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement and
include plural as well as the singular. Accounting terms not otherwise defined
have the meaning assigned to them in accordance with GAAP. Pronouns of either
gender or neuter shall include, as appropriate, the other pronoun forms.
Unless stated otherwise, the terms "dollars" and "$" shall mean United States
dollars. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. When
calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which
any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that
is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the
last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall
end on the next succeeding Business Day.

11.12 Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. None of the provisions of this Agreement
are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,
employee, Affiliate, stockholder, partner or any party hereto or any other
Person unless specifically provided otherwise herein and, except as so
provided, all provisions hereof shall be personal solely between the parties
to this Agreement; provided, however, that (a) Article 9 is intended to
benefit the Indemnified Parties and (b) Section 6.4 is intended to benefit the
Company Indemnified Parties.

11.13 Public Announcement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall make any
public announcement relating to this Agreement without the consent of the
other prior to the Closing. At the Closing, Parent and the Company shall issue
a mutually agreeable press release. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
make such disclosures regarding the Merger as it determines are required under
applicable securities Laws or regulatory or stock exchange rules.

11.14 Confidentiality.

(a) From and after the Closing, the restrictions on the use and disclosure of
Proprietary Information (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to
Parent or its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any information
relating to the Company Business as presently conducted and as proposed by the
Company to be conducted as of the Agreement Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement, after the
Closing: (i) all Proprietary Information included in the Company Intellectual
Property Rights or embodied in the Company Technology and Company 



Intellectual Property Rights that are not owned by a third Person shall be the
confidential information of Parent (and not of the Company or any of its
Affiliates) for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement, regardless of
whether such Proprietary Information or Technology were identified or
otherwise designated as "confidential," and (ii) Parent shall be considered
the "Disclosing Party" under the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company and
any of its Affiliates who have had access to Proprietary Information included
in the Company Intellectual Property Rights or embodied in the Company
Technology or Company Intellectual Property Rights that are not owned by a
third Person shall be considered the "Receiving Party" under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company and any of its respective directors,
officers and employees who have had access to such Proprietary Information or
Technology prior to the date of this Agreement shall be bound by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement until the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have no obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such Proprietary Information or
Technology.

(c) The parties agree to continue to abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, as amended pursuant to this Section 11.14. The Representative
agrees to hold this Agreement and each document contemplated hereby in
confidence and not disclose the terms hereof or thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby to any third party (other than the Indemnifying
Parties), except as reasonably necessary in order for Representative to
fulfill its obligations pursuant to ARTICLE IX.

11.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the
Company Ancillary Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Merger Sub
Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with
respect hereto or thereto. The express terms hereof control and supersede any
course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms
hereof.

11.16 Waiver of Conflicts. Each party acknowledges and agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees,
and Affiliates that the Company and the Company Securityholders are clients of
Cooley LLP ("Firm"). After the Closing, it is possible that Firm will
represent the Company Securityholders and/or the Representative (individually
and collectively, the "Seller Group") solely in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any claim for indemnification against the Company
Securityholders. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company hereby
agree that Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group in the
future solely in connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement
and any claims that may be made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement,
including a dispute that arises after the Closing between Parent (and/or the
Company) and the Representative, even though the interests of Representative
may be directly adverse to Parent or the Company, and even though the Firm may
have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company. Firm (or any successor)
may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller Group or any
representative or Affiliate of the Seller Group, solely in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party consents
thereto, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such
party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each party acknowledges that such
consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and
that the parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should
do so in this connection.

11.17 Privileged Information. It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that
Parent will own and control the attorney client privilege with respect to, and
will own, control and have the right to use, the Privileged Communications
following the Effective Time; provided, however, that following the Effective 



Time, the Representative and the Company Securityholders also will be
permitted to use Privileged Communications in connection with the defense of
any claim by Parent or any other Indemnified Party under Article 9.
