If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company Parties or the Buyer Parties or any of their 

   ##### 

  

    

respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the
Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or
filing the Other Filings (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and will include in such documents or responses all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent, and to the extent practicable, the
Company will provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in any
substantive calls between the Company, or any of its Representatives, and the
SEC concerning the Proxy Statement. 

  

 SECTION 7.02 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable after the date that the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Company Merger in compliance with Section 7.04(c), the Company Board shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that they approve this Agreement and the Company Merger and shall include such recommendations in the Proxy Statement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

Subject to Section 7.04(c), the Company will use reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Company Merger. 

  

 SECTION 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance with this Section 7.03, reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and all other financial, operating and other data and information relating to the Company and each Subsidiary and JV Entity as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of the Companys or any Subsidiarys employees, agents, or representatives, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) contact or have   ##### 

  

  

  

any discussions with any of the landlords/sublandlords, tenants/subtenants,
or licensees or franchisees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless in
each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ , that clauses (i) and
(ii) shall not be applicable to contacts or discussions not related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be applicable to
contacts and discussions with the Companys executive officers or its
financial advisors, or (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof.
Without limiting the provisions of this Section 7.03(a) and subject to any

shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give
the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof,
setting forth the inspection or materials that Parent or its representatives
intend to conduct. The Company shall be entitled to have representatives
present at all times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
the Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that upon the request of
Parent the Company and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consent from the applicable Third Party or enter into a
customary joint defense agreement, if applicable, to enable the disclosure of

made in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Blackstone Real Estate Advisors V L.P. and its Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) may furnish Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to any Person in connection with such Persons potential investment in Parent or its affiliates or evaluation of the acquisition of assets of the Company in connection with or following the Closing, in each case, so long as any such Person has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

   

 SECTION 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 7.04(c), none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Subsidiary shall, nor shall it authorize, directly or indirectly, any Representative of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or assistance) any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or release any Person from any standstill agreement or   ##### 

  

  

  

similar obligation to the Company or any Subsidiary other than the automatic
termination of standstill obligations pursuant to the terms of agreements as
in effect as of the date hereof, by virtue of the execution and announcement

this Section 7.04 shall preclude the Company, the Operating Partnership or
their respective Representatives from contacting any such party or parties
solely for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the last sentence
of this Section 7.04(a). 

   

 (b) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall promptly, and in any event within forty-eight hours after receipt, notify Parent of the receipt of (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or any Subsidiaries (other than requests for information unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal) or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, which any director, executive officer or trustee of the Company or any financial advisor, investment banker or attorney for the Company may receive after the date hereof. Such notification shall include, to the extent then known, the identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a summary written description thereof. The Company and the Operating Partnership shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis as to any material developments regarding any such proposal, indication, inquiry or request. None of the Company or any Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, in each case relating to an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) Subject to the Company Parties compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.04, and only prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, following the receipt by the Company or any Subsidiary of a written Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may (directly or through Representatives) (I) contact such Person and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions to consummation, so as to determine whether the proposal for an Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (II) if the Company Board determines in good faith following consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company Board thereafter may (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal (provided that the Company (A) has previously or concurrently furnished such information to Parent and (B) shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which is at least as favorable to the Company as the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such proposal, (iii) following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) recommend that the Companys shareholders approve such Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, effect a Change in Recommendation and   ##### 

  

  

  

(y) authorize the Company to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the implementation of such Superior Proposal; _provided_  that the Company
shall not enter into any such agreement unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated by the Company in accordance with Section 9.01(h). Nothing in
this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
Board from (i) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and other than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, effecting
a Change in Recommendation in the event that the Company Board has determined
in good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, or (ii)
taking and disclosing to the Company shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or from making any required disclosure to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law, including Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted
to recommend that the Company shareholders tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation, unless in each case such tender or exchange offer constitutes
a Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, effects a Change
in Recommendation. In addition, nothing in this Section 7.04(c) shall
prohibit the Company Parties from taking any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company Parties to take. 

   

 (d) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions contained in Article VII of the Company Charter or otherwise cause any of such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken in connection with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(h). 

   

 SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company has made available to Parent (or described on Section 7.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule) with all of the severance, change-in-control and similar obligations that are payable by their terms upon or following consummation of the Mergers at the Company Merger Effective Time or on the Closing Date, which are set forth in Section 7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor in accordance with their terms all severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and Parent shall pay or provide when due to any applicable current or former officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary any amounts payable and benefits to be provided under such agreements. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor in accordance with their terms any other employment related contracts, agreements, arrangements and commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or trustees of the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their predecessors or (ii) which are described on Section 7.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (b) For a period of not less than twenty-four months after the Closing Date, with respect to each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") who remains an employee of the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or   ##### 

  

  

  

any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide the Continuing
Employees with (i) (A) base salary and (B) cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding any cash bonuses related to equity or equity-
based awards and/or dividend equivalent payments related to equity or equity-
based awards), in each case in an amount at least equal to the same level
that was provided to each such Continuing Employee or to which such
Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time (and, in the case of bonuses, using target levels which are
not less than those in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time), and (ii) employee benefits (excluding any equity-based
benefits), that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective

service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities
thereof) before the Closing Date under any new parallel employee benefit plan
of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee become entitled
to participate to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the
Closing Date, to credit for such service under the respective Plan (except to
the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits and except
with respect to benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan). In addition,
with respect to any such health benefit plan in which the Continuing Employee
become entitled to participate during the calendar year that includes the
Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid
by the employee under the respective Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel
plan, program or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide severance benefits in accordance with Section 7.05(c) of the Disclosure Schedule to any Continuing Employee who is either involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) or asked to relocate the employees principal place of employment further than 25 miles, in each case during the twenty-four month period following the Closing Date, in an amount that is at least equal to the severance benefits that would have been paid to such employee pursuant to the terms of the Equity Office Properties Trust Severance Pay Plan disclosed in Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (but with a minimum payment equal to twelve weeks base salary), to be calculated, however, on the basis of the employees service at the time of the employees termination and the greater of the employees compensation at the time of (i) the employees termination or (ii) the Company Merger Effective Date. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common Shares or options or other rights to acquire Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Company Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate all share or investment-based non-qualified deferred compensation account-based arrangements (collectively, the " _Non-Qualified Account_    ##### 

  

  

  

 _Plans_ "), in a manner that is compliant with Section 409A of the Code. Such
action shall be contingent upon, and effective as of, the Company Merger
Effective Time. Payment of the Non-Qualified Account Plans shall be in cash
to the participants in the Non-Qualified Account Plans in a single lump-
sum payment by the Surviving Entity immediately following the Company Merger
Effective Time; provided, however, that payment shall be delayed to the date
six months following a participants separation from service in the event,
and to the extent, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time the Company
Board determines that such delay is necessary to comply with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (f) All restrictions on the disposition of Company Common Shares purchased under the Companys 1997 Non-Qualified Employee Share Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall terminate at the Company Merger Effective Time. The Company shall send written notice of the pending Company Merger that will result in the termination of the Company ESPP to all participating employees not later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof. No new offering periods will be allowed to commence under the Company ESPP during the period after the date hereof and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time unless this Agreement has been terminated.

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Operating Partnership Agreement or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the Subsidiaries (each of which shall remain in full force and effect following the Mergers and each of which Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Subsidiaries to honor), from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Operating Partnership shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the Company Merger Effective Time serving as a trustee, director or officer of the Company or the Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parents or the Surviving Entitys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by applicable Law, to repay such Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving Entitys written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of   ##### 

  

  

  

more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single Claim except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified
Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. The

The Company agrees to consult with Parent in connection with purchasing such coverage. The Company represents that the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement is set forth in Section 7.06(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. If the Company is unable to obtain the insurance described in the first sentence of this Section 7.06(c) for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

 (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Subsidiaries to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.06 and the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this Section 7.06.

None of the parties shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Mergers and the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 7.10 _Cooperation with Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such definitive agreements that are within their control.

judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any
material breach by any party of the Commitment Letters or any termination of
the Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to

ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without
first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any
alternative financing) has not been obtained, the Buyer Parties shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Mergers on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this Agreement and to

Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives in connection with such cooperation. The Buyer Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 7.10(b)) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 8.02(b), as it applies to the Companys   ##### 

  

  

  

obligations under this Section 7.10(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the
Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a
result of the Companys or the Subsidiaries willful and material breach of
its obligations under this Section 7.10(b). 

   

 (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 (v) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents receipt of such notice, (i) the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after the end of such three Business Day period, after considering the results of any such negotiations and the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to be a Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (vi) the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.03(b)(ii) simultaneously with such termination (any purported termination pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company shall have made such payment). 

  

 SECTION 9.02 _Effect of Termination_  . In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of any party hereto (or any Representatives thereof) except that the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the Buyer Parties contained in Sections 2.06, 3.07 and 7.10(b), the Guarantee referred to in Section 5.07(c) and the provisions of Section 7.03(b), Section 7.10(c), this Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X shall survive any such termination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful breach of any of its representations or warranties, or any breach of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination. 

  

 SECTION 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.03, all expenses (including fees and expenses payable to Representatives and hedging counterparties) incurred by any party to this Agreement or its Affiliates on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Mergers are consummated. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated: 

    

 (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.01(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d) (however, only in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 9.01(d) that relates to a breach by the Company Parties of their obligations under Section 7.02 or Section 7.04) and (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company Parties or publicly announced prior to such Termination Date (and with respect to termination pursuant to Section 9.01(b), such Acquisition Proposal was not withdrawn prior to the Termination Date), and (B) concurrently with such termination or within twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, the Company enters into a Contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in the foregoing 

   ##### 

  

   

clause (A)), then the Company shall pay to Parent, if and when such Contract
is entered into or consummation of such Acquisition Proposal occurs, as
applicable, the Company Termination Fee (and for purposes of this Section
9.03(b)(i), "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal); or 

   

 (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g), or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee on the Termination Date, and with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 9.01(h), such payment shall be made before or concurrently with such termination and shall be a condition to the effectiveness of such termination. 

  

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 9.03(b)(ii) for termination by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h), the Company Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing in immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal to $200,000,000. 

   

 (e) Subject to Section 10.06, if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(e), Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination, the reasonable Expenses of the Company Parties not to exceed $7,500,000 (the " _Company Expenses_ "). If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d), the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination, the reasonable Expenses of the Buyer Parties not to exceed $7,500,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), and to the extent any Parent Expenses are paid by the Company to Parent, such amount shall be deducted from any Company Termination Fee that may thereafter be payable by the Company pursuant to Section 9.03(b). Subject to Section 10.06, the payment of Company Expenses or Parent Expenses set forth in this Section 9.03 is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.03. 

   

 SECTION 9.04 _Escrow_. 

  

 (a) To the extent that the Company Parties recover money damages pursuant to and subject to Section 10.06 and the Guarantee (the " _Damages Amount_ "), Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Operating Partnership from the Damages Amount deposited into 

    ##### 

  

    

escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) the Damages Amount and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be
paid to the Operating Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("
_Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Companys independent certified
public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (A)
a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received
a ruling from the IRS described in Section 9.04(b) or (B) an opinion from the
Companys outside counsel as described in Section 9.04(b), an amount equal to
the Damages Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure
Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow
an amount in cash equal to the Damages Amount with an escrow agent selected
by Parent and on such terms (subject to Section 9.04(b)) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Operating Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent.
Subject to the terms of Section 10.06 and the Guarantee, the payment or
deposit into escrow of the Damages Amount pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall
be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Operating Partnership such
amount pursuant to Section 10.06 and the Guarantee by wire transfer or bank
check. 

   

 (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Damages Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Operating Partnership unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Operating Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Damages Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Operating Partnership of the Damages Amount would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Damages Amount to the Operating Partnership. Parent agrees to amend this Section 9.04 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Damages Amount that may be distributed from the escrow account to the Operating Partnership hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 9.04(b) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 9.04(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Damages Amount held in escrow for ten years shall be released by the escrow agent to Parent. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne solely by the Company. 

   

 SECTION 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the 

   ##### 

  

    

representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
agreement of the other party or any condition to its own obligations contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Company (on behalf of the Company
Parties) or Parent (on behalf of the Buyer Parties), as applicable. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 SECTION 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 10.04 _Amendment_. 

  

 This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of the Company Merger by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made without further shareholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

   

 SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. 

  

 This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except any of the Buyer Parties may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if the assignee does not perform its obligations. 

   

 SECTION 10.06 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. Without limiting the right to receive any payment it may be entitled to receive under Sections 2.06 and 7.10(b), each of the Company Parties agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages (including any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to Section 9.03(e)) in connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate 

   ##### 

  

    

liability of the Buyer Parties and Guarantor for such losses or damages shall
be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Guarantee, and in no event
shall the Company Parties seek to recover any money damages in excess of such
amount from the Buyer Parties or Guarantor or their respective
Representatives and affiliates in connection therewith. 

  

 SECTION 10.07 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed by any Company Party in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company Parties and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge that none of the Company Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Company Parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in Section 10.06 and the Guarantee; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by the Buyer Parties of Sections 7.03(b) and 7.10(c). 

  

 SECTION 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 7.06 (which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and the persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such persons). 

  

 SECTION 10.09 _Governing Law; Forum_. The Company Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Except as provided in the immediately proceeding sentence, this Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. 

  

 Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail to the address for notice in Section 10.02 with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal 

   ##### 

  

    

Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a)
or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon
such party personally within the State of Delaware. 

  

 SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 SECTION 10.12 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, to it that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.13.
