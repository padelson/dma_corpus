a subsequent letter from the Company&#146;s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii)&nbsp;a letter from the Company&#146;s counsel
indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Damages Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code (or alternatively, the Company&#146;s outside counsel has
