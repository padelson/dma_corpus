receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has as of the date hereof unanimously (a) adopted,
approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) declared
that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE CASH TENDER OFFER

 



 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Company has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under Section 1.1(c) and Section
1.2 in each case to the extent necessary for Purchaser to comply with its
obligation under this Section 1.1, as soon as practicable, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted in
accordance with Section 2.6(b)) for a price per share of Company Common Stock
equal to the Offer Price. As promptly as practicable on the later of: (i) the
earliest time as of which the Purchaser is permitted under the Exchange Act to
accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest time as of
which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived, the
Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) irrevocably
accept for purchase all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and
not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of the Purchaser
to accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall not be
subject to any other conditions), without limiting the right of the Parent or
the Purchaser to terminate, extend or modify the Offer to the extent permitted
under the terms of this Agreement. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer and this Agreement, the Purchaser shall promptly after the
Acceptance Time pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, for all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the
Offer.

 



 

(b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendment_.

 



 

(i) The Offer shall initially expire at midnight, Eastern time, at the end of
the day that is the 20th Business Day after commencement of the Offer
(determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act). Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Parent and the
Purchaser expressly reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion,
to (A) increase the Offer Price, (B) waive any of the Offer Conditions, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to the Acceptance
Time and (C) make other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer prior
to the Acceptance Time to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither the Parent nor the Purchaser shall (without the prior
written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion): (1)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the Offer
Price, increase the Offer Price in

 



      
 

 



 

an increment of less than $0.25 per share or change the Offer so that it is
for fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted in accordance
with Section 2.6(b)); (2) except pursuant to Section 1.1(b)(ii) or Section
1.1(f), terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the
expiration date of the Offer; (3) provide any "subsequent offering period" (or
any extension thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11promulgated under the
Exchange Act; (4) amend, change or waive the Minimum Condition or the
condition in clause (c)(v) of Annex I; (5) amend, modify or supplement any of
the Offer Conditions in any manner that is adverse to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock or that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Offer or
prevent, delay or impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (6) amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer
(other than the Offer Conditions) in any manner that is adverse to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or impair the ability
of the Parent or the Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (7) impose any condition
to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to the last
sentence of this Section 1.1(b)(ii)), the Purchaser shall extend the scheduled
expiration date of the Offer: (A) as required by applicable law (including for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC); (B) in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Offer if and only to the extent required to comply with
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC; and (C) if at the then scheduled
expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions has not been
satisfied (and the Parent or the Purchaser has not waived such condition in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and without limiting Purchasers
obligation to further extend the Offer until the earlier of the Outside Date
or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, for one or more
periods specified by the Purchaser (not in excess of ten (10) Business Days
each, or for such longer period as the parties may agree in writing) in order
to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall not be required to, and
without the Companys prior written consent shall not, extend the Offer beyond
the Outside Date. Nothing in this Section 1.1(b)(ii) shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
the Parent or the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1.

 



 

(c) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and a form of
the related letter of transmittal in customary form (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Parent and the Purchaser shall cause
the Offer Documents (i) to comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and (ii) on the date
first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the
holders of shares of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Common Stock, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that no covenant is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company in writing specifically
for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable
U.S. federal securities laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or on its behalf
specifically for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the other Offer Documents if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law, and the
Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the other Offer Documents and to cause the
Schedule TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the
other Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Except to the extent
related to the Parent or the Purchasers response to an Acquisition Proposal,
a Trigger Event or a Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer
Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
or dissemination to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Except to
the extent related to the Parent or the Purchasers response to an Acquisition
Proposal, a Trigger Event or a Recommendation Change Notice, the Parent and
the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Parent,
the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC with respect to the
Offer or any Offer Document promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult
with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and
shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses
thereto and telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of the
Parent or the Purchaser or their counsel. Subject to the foregoing, the Parent
and the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any such
comments promptly after they are received.

 



 

(d) _Provision of Information for Schedule 14d-9_. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly supply to the Company in writing, for inclusion in the Schedule
14d-9, all information concerning Parent and the Purchaser required under
applicable U.S. federal securities laws to be included in the Schedule 14d-9.

 



 

(e) _Provisions of Funds by the Parent_. The Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, on behalf of the Purchaser, with the Paying Agent,
prior to or promptly following the Acceptance Time (but in no event later than
the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Business Day during which the Acceptance Time occurs or the immediately
following Business Day if the Acceptance Time does not occur on a Business
Day), all of the funds necessary to purchase any and all shares of Company
Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Offer and Return of Tendered Shares_. Unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Purchaser shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without
the prior written consent of the

 



       
 

 



 

Company in its sole and absolute discretion. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) following such termination terminate the
Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
thereto. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this Agreement prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Purchaser shall promptly return, or cause any
depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock to the tendering stockholders.

 



 

(g) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. Subject to all limitations set forth in
Section 5.1 hereof, the Offer Price shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time.

 



 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) _Approval and Consent_. The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and, subject to Section 6.1 below, to the inclusion of the recommendation of
the Company Board that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender
their shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer in the
Offer Documents.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date of the commencement of the Offer,
concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that contains the fairness opinion of the Companys
financial advisor referenced in Section 3.18 and the notice and other
information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, and disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable laws, to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the
record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Except as permitted pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 6.1 below, the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 shall
contain the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys
stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their shares of Company Common
Stock to the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "). The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (i) to comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S.
federal securities laws and (ii) on the date first filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of the Parent or the Purchaser in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, the
Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by it
or on its behalf specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law, and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws.

 



 

(c) _Sharing of Materials and Information_. Except to the extent related to an
Acquisition Proposal, a Trigger Event or a Recommendation Change Notice:

 



 

(i) The Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel with a copy of any
written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Parent and its
counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall provide the Parent
and its counsel with a copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic
notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company or its counsel.
Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to any such comments promptly after they are received.

(e) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to

designated agent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the

of shares of Company Common Stock (the date of the list used by the Purchaser

with the Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the due
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State or at such
subsequent time or date as the Parent and the Company shall, subject to

_Effective Time_ ").

by law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the Closing shall take
place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, MA 02109 as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time,

last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Purchaser shall cease, the Purchaser shall be merged with and into the
Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger and (b) the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, the
Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and
restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time,
they are identical to the bylaws of the Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the
Purchaser therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and,
as so amended and

 



      
 

 



 

restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 



 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the

of office set forth in certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and until their successors are duly elected and
qualified.

 



 

2.6 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Purchaser, the
Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Purchaser:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Converted Shares_.
All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Parent, the
Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned directly by any Subsidiary of the Company shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation so as to maintain relative ownership percentages.

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.7,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled or converted in
accordance with Section 2.6(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.7.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 5.1 below, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

 



      
 

 



 

2.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, Parent shall engage
the Paying Agent. At, prior to or promptly following the Acceptance Time (but
in no event later than the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the Business Day during which the Acceptance Time occurs or the
immediately following Business Day if the Acceptance Time does not occur on a
Business Day), the Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with
this Section 2.7, the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable hereunder and the Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that the Payment Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy the
Parents obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments (net of any losses)
shall be paid to the Parent pursuant to Section 2.7(e). In the event the
Payment Fund is diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to
make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.7(b), including any such
diminishment as a result of investment losses, the Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required
to make such payments.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(g)) to the Paying Agent,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(g)) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 2.7(g)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
promptly paid in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available
funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.7(g)) multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(ii) With respect to Uncertificated Shares, the Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the holders of
Uncertificated Shares to ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to such
holder or its nominees, upon

 



      
 

 



 

surrender of Uncertificated Shares held of record by such holder or its
nominees in accordance with customary surrender procedures (including receipt
by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form and/or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), the Merger Consideration pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and each such Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 



 

(c) _Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time_. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Uncertificated Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.7, each Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
Section 2.6(c), without any interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.7(e).

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 2.7
shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date

 



      
 

 



 

on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any governmental authority, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately prior to such time
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required
by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

2.8 _Company Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest in full and
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of
cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company Stock
Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any
interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. In the event that
the exercise price of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled,
without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no
further force or effect.

 



 

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is then outstanding and unvested shall vest in full and automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash from the
Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU multiplied by (ii)
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all
applicable withholding.

 



 

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company PSU
that is then-outstanding and unvested shall vest with respect to the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be earned thereunder and
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of
cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company PSU
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions and take
such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs as contemplated by this
Section 2.8.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments
contemplated by the foregoing Section 2.8(a), Section 2.8(b) and Section
2.8(c) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs or Company PSUs a letter describing the treatment of and payment
for such equity awards pursuant to this Section 2.8 and providing instructions
for use in obtaining payment therefor. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review the notices described in this Section 2.8(f)
reasonably in advance of providing said notices and the Company shall consider
in good faith any reasonable comments provided by Parent to the Company.

 



 

(g) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in a manner other than that
contemplated above in this Section 2.8 to the extent necessary to take into
account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

 



 

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6, but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6, without interest, and shall not
thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relates to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not settle or pay or make any
payment or settlement offer with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument or agree to do any of the foregoing unless the Parent shall have
given its written consent to such settlement, payment or settlement or payment
offer.

 



 

2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any other recipient of
payments hereunder any amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely remitted by the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder or other recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

ARTICLE VI

 



 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
until the Specified Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall cause its directors, officers and senior
management not to and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) provide any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person or group who has made or would reasonably be
expected to make any Acquisition Proposal or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) amend or grant a waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock (other than for Parent or
its Affiliate), except under the circumstances permitted under this Section
6.1(a); or

 



 

(iv) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), if at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received after the date of this
Agreement a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this Section 6.1, and (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal (the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, a " _Qualified Person_ ") and that the failure to take such action
described in clause (A) or clause (B) below would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law,
then the Company may (A) furnish non-public information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Qualified Person (and the Representatives
of such Qualified Person), pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not
materially less restrictive with respect to the confidentiality and non-use
obligations of the Qualified Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (
_provided_ , that the Company shall substantially concurrently provide to
Parent, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any
non-public written information and any other material non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to (or given
access to) such Qualified Person and which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent), (B) engage in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals) with any such Qualified Person
(and the Representatives of such Qualified Person) regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal and (C) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock with
any Qualified Person.

 



 

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance its terms, the Company Board shall not, except as set
forth in this Section 6.1, (x) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9,(y) withhold, withdraw or modify or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the
Parent or the Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation or (z) approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, declare the
advisability of or

 



      
 

 



 

recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (x), (y)
or (z), a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");

 



 

(ii) Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance its terms, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing
for a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the
circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement (including the provisions of this Section 6.1), at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal concurrently with
causing the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 8.1(f) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing
for such Superior Proposal or (B) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
(other than pursuant to clause (z) of the definition thereof) in response to
an Intervening Event if (in the case of either clause (A) or (B): (i) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; (ii) the Company has notified the Parent in writing at
least four (4) Business Day prior to taking such action that it intends to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail
the reasons for such Company Board Recommendation Change (a " _Recommendation
Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the Recommendation Change Notice
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change
or a Trigger Event for purposes of this Agreement so long as such notice
clearly states that it is not a Company Board Recommendation Change and that
the Company Board is not changing the Company Board Recommendation); (iii) if
requested by the Parent, the Company shall have made available and instructed
its Representatives to discuss and negotiate with the Parents Representatives
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (in a
manner that would obviate the need to effect such Company Board Recommendation
Change) during the four (4) Business Day period following delivery by the
Company to the Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice; and (iv) at the
end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel), after
giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by the Parent, that the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and, with respect to a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with financial advisor and outside counsel) that
such initial or revised (as applicable) Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, if there are any material
amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the
Companys stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal,
whether or not material), the Company shall notify the Parent of each such
amendment, revision or change in compliance with Section 6.1(c) and the
applicable four (4) Business Day period described above shall be extended
until at least two (2) Business Days after

 



      
 

 



 

the time that the Parent receives notification from the Company of each such
amendment, revision or change and the Company Board shall not make a Company
Board Recommendation Change prior to the end of any such period as so extended
and compliance with the other requirements described above during such period
as so extended.

 



 

(c) _Notices to the Parent_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) advise the Parent orally and in writing of the
Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any material
developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, including any
material changes to the terms thereof. The Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within one (1) Business Day) provide Parent with copies of all written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, and oral
summaries of any material oral requests, proposals or offers, received by or
made to the Company from any Person or group making an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to
the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the
information required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.1(c).

 



 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder (any "stop, look and listen" communication, in and of itself, shall
not be deemed to constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that this Section 6.1(d)
shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in
accordance with, Section 6.1(b).

 



 

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, except with respect to the Parent and the Purchaser, (i)
cease immediately all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the
date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential or non-public information
previously furnished to any Person within the last twelve (12) months for the
purpose of evaluating a possible Acquisition Proposal and (iii) terminate
access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not in
any way limit or modify any of the Companys rights under the other provisions
of this Section 6.1.

 



 

6.2 _Nasdaq Listing_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq
Stock Market until the Effective Time. Each of the parties hereto agrees to
cooperate with the other parties hereto and to use its reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market as promptly as possible
following the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common
Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



 

6.3 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly modified herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, notwithstanding anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Parent and the Parents
Representatives, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal
business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere
with business operations, to all of its employees (subject to this Section
6.3(b)), properties, books, contracts and records as the Parent shall
reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Parent (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its employees
(subject to this Section 6.3(b)), business, properties and assets as the
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, (A) to the extent related to an Acquisition Proposal or a Trigger
Event (except as otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement), or (B)
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) would: (1) violate any legal requirement or contract
(including confidentiality provisions thereof), or (2) jeopardize protections
afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work
product doctrine (so long as in connection with this clause (B) the Company
has used commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and practicable under the circumstances); _provided_ _further_
, that the Company shall not be required to provide access to its employees
(other than senior management) other than pursuant to a reasonable integration
plan that has been agreed in good faith by the Company and the Parent or as
otherwise reasonably approved by the Company; _provided_ _further_ that the
Company shall only be required to provide access to its senior management
(other than the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) following reasonable
advance notice from Parent to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Any
such information shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary,
during the Pre-Closing Period, subject to compliance with applicable law,
Parent and its Representatives shall be permitted to contact or communicate
with any of the licensors, customers or suppliers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after providing notice to the Company it being understood that
nothing herein shall restrict Parents ability to contact or interact with any
such persons for reasons other than related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.4(b),
Section 6.4(c) and Section 6.4(d), each party hereto shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 



 

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained by such
party (or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity or third party
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay any monies (except for
filings or similar fees) or (except, in the case of the Parent or the
Purchaser, as contemplated by, and subject to, Section 6.4(d)) agree to any
material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing;

 



 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer
and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any
other applicable law;

 



 

(iv) contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial
action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of prohibiting
consummation of the Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

 



 

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (ii) or (iii), including providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing Person and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested,
accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may,
as each determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 6.4 as "Outside
Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall
limit any obligation under any other provision in this Section 6.4.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.4,
each of the Parent and the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, if required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity,
without the prior written consent of the other parties.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parents obligations
under Section 6.4(d), the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for the
Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any government requests for
information under any Antitrust Law, to cause any waiting periods under any
applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be terminated, and to contest and
resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Restrictive
Order. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law. To the extent permitted by law or
Governmental Entities reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate
in meetings and other substantive conversations with any such Governmental
Entities.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent
shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of the Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the
offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Acceptance Time beyond the Outside Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any of the actions under this Section 6.4(d) or any other
provision of Section 6.4 that would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Parent, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries. For the purposes of this
provision, a material adverse effect shall be measured relative to the size of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, regardless of whether such
actions are imposed on, or affect, the Parent, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 6.4(d), the Parent shall
take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement
for a waiver, consent, approval or termination of applicable waiting periods
of the Federal Trade Commission, the

 



      
 

 



 

Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or
other Governmental Entity and (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, in each case
pursuant to any Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Offer or the
Merger by the Outside Date.

 



 

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement that is not
limited to previously approved statements; _provided_ , _however_ , that these
restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications (or the Parents or
the Purchasers response thereto) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
a Trigger Event or a Recommendation Change Notice.

 



 

6.6 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, each of the Parent and, from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, manager,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a
director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or
was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an
officer, director, manager, employee or agent of another Person, in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted to do so under applicable law. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in
the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication) within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Parent from the Indemnified Party of
a request therefor; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such advances an undertaking,
to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable law, to repay such
advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged

 



       
 

 



 

to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to this Section 6.6(c), the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement
and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term;.
Subject to this Section 6.6(c), if the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations existing insurance contemplated by the prior sentence expires,
is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, to the Indemnified Parties
than the Current DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company may, and the Company shall if requested by Parent,
prior to the Acceptance Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement (after
reasonable consultation with the Parent), provided that the Company does not
pay or commit to pay, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Premium for such
Reporting Tail Endorsement without discussing in good faith with the Parent
the Companys discussions with its insurers, the quoted cost and reasons
therefor and considering in good faith any alternatives that the Parent may
suggest to the Company in lieu of obtaining such Reporting Tail Endorsement.
If a Reporting Tail Endorsement has been purchased by the Company prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Parent shall cause such Reporting Tail Endorsement to be
maintained in full force and effect for its full term and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation and, in such
case, the Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this
Section 6.6(c) shall be deemed satisfied.

 



 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume (or assume by operation of law) and succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.6.

 



 

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is denied by the Parent
and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute,
bylaw or agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs.

 



 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Specified Time, the Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of the Parents
obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of the Purchaser)
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of any
representation or warranty of the Company, in any manner that would result in
the failure of the condition set forth in clause (c)(ii) of _Annex I_ or (ii)
in the case of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Purchaser,
in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Specified Time or (b) any material breach by such
Person (or, in case of the Parents obligation to provide notice, any material
breach by the Purchaser) of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder.

 



 

6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company (including the Surviving Corporation) to, carry out all employer
responsibilities under all Company Employee Plans in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of one
year following the Effective Time, the Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each Company Employee (i) a base salary, commission
opportunities, annual bonus opportunities and the value of annual equity
awards no less favorable in the aggregate than the total compensation package
(including base salary, commission opportunities, annual bonus opportunities
and value of annual equity awards) provided to such Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided
to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the New Plans, each Company Employee
shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee
Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company Employee Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical,

 



      
 

 



 

dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (B) the Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment
agreement providing for severance benefits) whose employment is terminated on
or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances
under which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under
the Company Severance Practices, the Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to
severance benefits from the Surviving Corporation that are equal to the
severance benefits that would have been paid under the Company Severance
Practices as in existence on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume in accordance with their terms, all
contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

(e) The provisions of Sections 6.8(a) through 6.8(c) shall not apply to
persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United
States, it being agreed that such persons shall be treated in accordance with
applicable law and the terms of any contracts covering them.

 



 

(f) At the request of the Parent made at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall take all steps necessary to terminate the
Cynosure, Inc. 401(k) Plan and any and all of the Company Employee Plans that
are intended to be qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the Code (such plans, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_"), with such
termination to be effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date and reflected in the resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of the Parent). In connection with the termination of the Company
401(k) Plans, the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit
each Company Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Company Employee from each Company 401(k) Plan, including, subject to vendors
capabilities and procedures, notes evidencing any

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding loans, from such Company 401(k) Plan to a Parent 401(k) plan that
is qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.

 



 

(g) Without limiting Section 10.4, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon
any Company Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of the Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent to discharge or terminate the services
of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Employee Plan or employee
benefit plan of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) create any third-
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

6.9 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation (collectively, an " _Anti-Takeover Law_ ") is or may become
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company, the Company Board, Parent and Purchaser, as applicable, each shall
use its respective reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(b) otherwise take all such actions as are necessary to eliminate the effects
of any such statute or regulation on such transactions; _provided_ that, the
Parent and the Purchaser shall only be required to take any action pursuant to
this Section 6.9 if they have received written notice from the Company
regarding the applicability of such Anti-Takeover Law and the Company has
requested in such written notice that the Parent and the Purchaser take
specified actions to render such Antitakeover Law inapplicable.

 



 

6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under such rule to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

6.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and until the Specified
Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or
arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to
which benefits are provided, in each case, to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, unless
prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (each member of which the Company
Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of the
applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and shall be an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act each such plan, program or arrangement,
and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement; _provided_ that
nothing in this Section 6.11 shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give the Parent or the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Acceptance Time and
(b) prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its and its Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

6.13 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation related to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby is brought by any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the
Companys other securities against the Company and/or its directors or
officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to the following
sentence), the Company shall have the right to control the defense of any
litigation related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought by any stockholder of the
Company or any holder of the Companys other securities against the Company
and/or its directors or officers, provided that the Company shall give the
Parent the opportunity to participate, at the Parents expense, in the defense
of any such litigation and the Company shall give due consideration to the
Parents advice with respect to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not settle or
enter into any negotiations or agreement with respect to the settlement of any
such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed (provided that
Parent shall not withhold its consent if the settlement involves (a) solely
the payment of an aggregate amount not to exceed $350,000 and supplemental
disclosure (provided that the Parent shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any supplemental disclosure and the Company shall
consider in good faith any reasonable changes thereto proposed by Parent) ,
(b) no admission of wrongdoing or liability, (c) no injunctive or similar
relief, (d) a complete and unconditional release of all defendants in respect
of all disclosure claims then pending relating to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (e) the
withdrawal or dismissal of all claims and actions then pending relating to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby)). Each of the Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly
of the commencement of any such stockholder litigation of which it has
received notice.

 



 

6.14 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the
Offer, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in
office as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the
Effective Time (resigning from all directorships with the Company and its
Subsidiaries).

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the
Merger may be abandoned (with respect to Sections 8.1(b) through 8.1(i), by

Purchaser):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time;

 



 

(b) by either the Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the Outside Date (provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party
hereto if the failure of such party (or, in the case of the Parent, Purchaser)
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the
Outside Date);

 



 

(c) by either the Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable
final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, and payment
for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or consummation of
the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party hereto shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the
failure of such party (or, in the case of the Parent, Purchaser) to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted
in the issuance of any such order, decree, ruling or the taking of such other
action;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been extended
pursuant to Section 1.1(b)) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition, without the Purchaser having accepted for payment any
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party hereto shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if

fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Condition;

 



 

(e) by the Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if: (i) the Company Board
shall have failed to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the
Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to

include such recommendation); (ii) the Company Board shall have effected a
Company Board Recommendation Change; or (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer

shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within ten (10) Business Days
after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board
shall have failed to recommend against acceptance of such offer (each of
clauses (i) through (iii), a " _Trigger Event_ ");

 



 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in order to
effect a Change of Recommendation and enter into a definitive agreement
providing for a Superior Proposal; provided that (i) the Company has complied
in all material respects with the terms of Section 6.1(b) with respect to such
Superior Proposal and (ii) immediately prior (and as a condition) to the
termination of this Agreement, the Company pays the Parent the Termination Fee
contemplated by Section 8.3(b)(ii);

 



 

(g) by the Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach
of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any of the Companys representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) would cause any of the conditions set
forth in clauses (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of _Annex I_ not to be satisfied, and
(ii) is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being
cured by the Outside Date, shall not have been cured within twenty (20)
Business Days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform from the Parent; _provided_ that
neither the Parent nor the Purchaser is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement;

 



 

(h) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach
of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any of the Parents or the Purchasers
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) shall have had
or would reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) is not capable of being cured by the Outside

Company; _provided_ that the Company is not then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement; or

 



      
 

 



 

(i) by the Company (A) if the Purchaser shall have failed to commence (within

period specified in Section 1.1(a); _provided_ that the Company is not then in
material breach of Section 1.1(c) or Section 1.2 or (B) if the Purchaser shall

Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) within two (2) Business
Days of the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended) and as of such
expiration, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Parent, the
Company, the Purchaser or their respective Representatives, stockholders or
Affiliates (except as provided in Section 8.3(d)); _provided_ that, subject to
Section 8.3(d), (a) any such termination shall not relieve any party hereto
from liability for fraud or any Willful Breach and (b) the provisions of
Section 6.3(a) (Confidentiality), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination),
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), Article IX (Defined Terms) and Article X
(Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the
Offer or the Merger is consummated.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay the Parent the Termination Fee in the event that
this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e);

 



 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or

 



 

(iii) by either the Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(d) or the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g) (arising from a breach
of the Companys covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement), if (A)
before the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced and not irrevocably withdrawn at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the earlier of the date of such termination, the Outside Date
and the-then scheduled expiration date of the Offer and (B) within 12 months
after the date of such termination, any Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal is entered
into and such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter consummated;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of Section 8.3(b)(iii), all
references to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%". Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i)
shall be paid by or on behalf of the Company to the Parent by wire transfer of
same-day funds within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination of
this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(ii) shall be paid by or on
behalf of the Company to the Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds prior
to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of) such
termination. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(iii) shall

 



      
 

 



 

be paid by or on behalf of the Company to the Parent by wire transfer of same-
day funds within one (1) Business Day after the date any transaction
referenced in clause (B) of Section 8.3(b)(iii) is consummated.

 



 

(c) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) The agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement absent such agreement. Notwithstanding Section 8.2
or any other provision of this Agreement, other than in the case of any
Willful Breach of Section 1.2, Section 6.1 or Section 6.4, payment of the fees
described in this Section 8.3 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parent and the Purchaser in connection with any termination of this
Agreement in the circumstances in which such fees became payable. Other than
in the case of any Willful Breach of Section 1.2, Section 6.1 or Section 6.4,
in the event that the Parent shall receive the Termination Fee, the receipt of
such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Parent, the Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of the Parent, the Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates or any Representative
of the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee when due
and payable pursuant to this Agreement and, in order to obtain such payment,
the Parent commences an action or other proceeding that results in an award
against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay interest on the amount
of such fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, the Parent and
Purchaser to the extent permitted by law; _provided_ that following the
Acceptance Time, this Agreement may not be amended in any manner that causes
the Merger Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto.

 



 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is

 



      
 

 



 

specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any party hereto may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties
hereto notice in the manner herein set forth.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto,
or between the Company and the Purchaser or between the Company and the
Parent, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the
parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior
understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

10.4 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a)
as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 6.6
(with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries), and (b) from and after the Acceptance Time and Effective Time
(as applicable), the rights of holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs to receive the
consideration in each case in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Articles I and II.

 



 

10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Purchaser may transfer or
assign all or any part of their respective rights, in whole or in part, under
this Agreement or under any related agreement, document or instrument to any
lender (or any administrative or collateral agent on behalf of itself and such
lender(s)) as collateral security (it being understood that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve the Parent and the Purchaser of their respective
obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in any
other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the court making such determination shall have the power to
limit the term or provision (or part thereof), to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part
thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof), and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid
and enforceable term or provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term (or part thereof).

 



      
 

 



 

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan (including
by portable document format (.pdf)) delivered by electronic mail), each of
which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile or by
an electronic scan (including by portable document format (.pdf)) delivered by
electronic mail.

 



 

10.8 _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"include", "includes" and "including" are not limiting; (b) "hereof",
"hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (c) "date hereof" refers to the date
set forth in the initial caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase does not mean simply "if"; (e) descriptive headings, the table
of defined terms and the table of contents are inserted for convenience only
and do not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement;
(f) definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a Person are also to
its permitted successors and assigns; (h) references to an "Article",
"Section", "Recital", "preamble", "Annex", "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an
Article, Section, Recital or preamble of, or an Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to,
this Agreement; (i) references to "$" or otherwise to dollar amounts refer to
the lawful currency of the United States; (j) references to a federal, state,
local or foreign statute or law include any rules, regulations and delegated
legislation issued thereunder; (k) references to a communication by a
regulatory agency include a communication by the staff of such regulatory
agency and (l) references to "made available" mean made available through an
electronic data room, through EDGAR or otherwise at least four (4) hours prior
to the execution of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
party hereto. No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

 



 

10.10 _Remedies; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and
the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, as money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or the Parent and/or the
Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and the
Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement, in each case without posting a
bond or other security. No party hereto shall raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, or to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Time shall be of the essence
for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT
OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER,
(III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



 

10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Person with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the

 



      
 

 



 

manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this
Section 10.11, however, shall affect the right of any Person to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law.

 



 

10.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections; provided
that no disclosure in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
modify or qualify any provision of Section 5.1 unless such disclosure is
expressly included in Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

10.13 _Parent Guarantee_. The Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause the Purchaser or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations
under this Agreement. The Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the
full and complete performance by the Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of the Purchaser under this Agreement.

 _ANNEX I_

 



 

 _Conditions of the Offer_

 



 

 _All terms defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") of
which this Annex I is a part and used in this Annex I shall have the meanings
assigned to such terms in the Agreement._

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not be required (and the Parent shall not be required to cause
the Purchaser) to irrevocably accept for purchase or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn), and may terminate or amend
the Offer in accordance with (and to the extent permitted by) the terms of the
Agreement, and may postpone the acceptance of, or payment for, any shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with (and to the extent permitted by) the
terms of the Agreement, if:

 



 

(a) immediately prior to the-then scheduled expiration of the Offer, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn, together with any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned
by the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent, does not equal at least one
share more than half of all shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
(the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) immediately prior to the-then scheduled expiration of the Offer, any
waiting period (and any extensions thereof) and any approvals or clearances
applicable to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act
and the German Act Against Restraints of Competition of 1958, as amended,
shall not have expired, or been terminated or obtained, as applicable; or

 



 

(c) any of the following shall exist:

 



 

(i) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive order, temporary
restraining order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or
permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the effect of prohibiting
the consummation of the Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

 



 

(ii) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 3.7(a) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the
expiration of the Offer as though made on and as of the expiration of the
Offer (except that representations and warranties that by their terms speak
specifically as of the date of this Agreement or another date, in which case
as of such date); (B) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in the third sentence of Section 3.2(a) and in the first and second
sentences of Section 3.2(c) shall not be true and correct in all respects as
of the expiration of the Offer as though made on and as of such date (except
that representations and warranties that by their terms speak specifically as
of the date of this Agreement or another date, in which case as of such date),
except for any _de minimis_ exceptions; (C) the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.1 and in Section
3.4(a), Section 3.4(e), Section 3.19 and Section 3.20 shall

      
 

 



 

not be true and correct in all material respects as of the expiration of the
Offer as though made on and as of the expiration of the Offer (except that
representations and warranties that by their terms speak specifically as of
the date of this Agreement or another date, in which case as of such date);
and (D) all the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in this Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the expiration of the
Offer (without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect contained therein) as though made on and as of the
expiration of the Offer (except that representations and warranties that by
their terms speak specifically as of the date of this Agreement or another
date, in which case as of such date), except where any failures of any such
representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect
to any qualification as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
contained therein) have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply with in all material
respects its covenants and obligations required to be performed or complied
with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the Offer;

 



 

(iv) the Parent and the Purchaser shall not have received a certificate
executed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
dated the expiration date of the Offer, confirming on behalf of the Company
that the conditions set forth in clauses (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) of this _Annex
I_ have been duly satisfied; or

 



 

(v) the Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
Article VIII of the Agreement.

 



 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of the Parent and the Purchaser to extend, terminate or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing
conditions may be waived by the Parent or the Purchaser in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in their sole and absolute discretion (except
for the Minimum Condition), subject to the terms of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by the Parent or the
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Exhibit A  Page 1     
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by the
laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporations By-laws. The affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors present at any regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present shall be required to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporations By-laws. The Corporations By-
laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of the capital stock issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single
class, in addition to any other vote required by this Certificate of
Incorporation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation, and notwithstanding the fact
that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, but in addition to any vote
of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation
required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of the capital stock issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single

Corporation in the State of Delaware. Elections of directors need not be by
written ballot unless and to the extent that the By-Laws so provide.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided herein and subject to the provisions of Section
6.6 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 14, 2017, among the
Corporation, Hologic, Inc. and Minuteman Merger Sub, Inc., the Corporation
reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained
in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by statute and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights
conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision of law that might
otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the
holders of any class or series of stock of this Corporation required by law,
this Certificate of Incorporation may include any provision requiring for any
corporate action the vote of a larger portion of the stock or of any class or
series thereof, or of any other securities having voting power, or a larger
number of the directors, than is required by the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, and such provision requiring such greater vote shall not be altered,
amended or repealed except by such greater vote.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of Delaware prohibits
the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of
fiduciary duty, no director of the

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 2      
 

 



 

Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability. No amendment to
or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability
or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to
any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:

 



 

1. _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), liability, loss, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 3     
 

 



 

and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or
her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo_
_contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 



 

2. _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 4     
 

 



 

the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this
Section 2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to
the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the
case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware
or such other court shall deem proper.

 



 

3. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article X, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article X, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.

 



 

4. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 5     
 

 



 

employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be
at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by
Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or
position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in
the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation
or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which
cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense
of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article X.
The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to
assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the
conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be
required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article X for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without
its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or
limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written consent. Neither the
Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to
any proposed settlement.

 



 

5. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article X, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article X, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 6     
 

 



 

such matter; _provided_ , however, that if the General Corporation Law of
Delaware requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his
or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) the payment of such expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of
such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation as authorized in this Article X; and further provided that no
such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article X if it is
determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not
act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe
his or her conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without
reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

 



 

6. _Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement_. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article X, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article X (and none of the circumstances described in Section 4 of this Article X that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the Corporation determines within such 60-day period that

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 7     
 

 



 

Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article X, as the case may be. Any such
indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to
requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is
proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in
each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation
consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum,
(b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of
disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no
disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular
legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

 



 

7. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article X shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 of this Article X that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article X or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 8     
 

 



 

Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in
connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in (i) any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

 



 

8. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article X, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article X in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article X, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

 



 

9. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article X or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 9     
 

 



 

out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to
the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

 



 

10. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article X shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article X shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article X. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article X.

 



 

11. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article X to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

 



 

Exhibit A  Page 10     
 

 



 

12. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

 



 

13. _Savings Clause_. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

14. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).
