    (c)&#160;Upon the terms and subject to the terms and conditions
    of this Agreement, R&#038;M and T-3 shall, and shall cause each
    of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use
    reasonable best efforts to obtain any Consents of any
    Governmental Entity, and to make any registrations,
    declarations, notices or filings, if any, necessary for Closing
    under the HSR Act, and any other Federal, state or foreign Law
    designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
    purpose or effect of monopolization, restraint of trade or
    regulation of foreign investment (collectively
    &#147;<U>Antitrust Laws</U>&#148;), to respond promptly to any
    requests of any Governmental Entity for information under any
    Antitrust Law, to secure the expiration or termination of any
    applicable waiting period, to resolve any objections asserted
    with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
    raised by any Governmental Entity and to contest and resist any
    action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
    action, and to prevent the entry of any court order and to have
    vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Judgment (whether
    temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or
    prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
    Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
    another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
    connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
    memoranda, briefs, responses, arguments, opinions and proposals
    made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
    connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
    Law. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, the
    parties: (i)&#160;providing, in the case of oral communications
    with a Governmental Entity, advance notice of any such
    communication and, whether or not initiated by a party, an
    opportunity for the other party to participate;
    (ii)&#160;providing, in the case of written communications, an
    opportunity for the other party to comment on any such
    communication (including the incorporation of such reasonable
    comments) and provide the other with a final copy of all such
    communications (except for documents or information that reveal
    any party&#146;s negotiating objectives or strategies), which
    shall, where applicable, be provided under a joint defense
    agreement. Nothing in this Section&#160;6.03 shall require
    R&#038;M or any R&#038;M Subsidiary to make a Divestiture, other
    than any Divestiture or Divestitures that may be conditioned
    upon the consummation of the Merger and involve assets of
    R&#038;M, T-3 or any of their respective Subsidiaries that
    accounted, in the aggregate, for less than $5,000,000 of
    consolidated revenues (to R&#038;M or T-3 as the case may be)
    during the four most recently completed fiscal quarters of
    R&#038;M or T-3, as applicable, preceding the date of this
    Agreement.
