   _AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

  



  

  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this  " _Agreement_ ") is made as of
October 6,  2010, among ROBBINS and MYERS, INC., an Ohio corporation  (" _R
andM_"), T-3 ENERGY SERVICES, INC., a  Delaware corporation (" _T-3_ "),
TRIPLE  MERGER I, INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned  subsidiary
of RandM (" _Merger Sub_ "), and  TRIPLE MERGER II, INC., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned  subsidiary of RandM (" _Merger Sub II_ "). 
Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used in this  Agreement shall
have the respective meanings set forth in  Section 9.03 of this Agreement. 

  



  

  A. The Board of Directors of T-3 (the " _T-3  Board_ ") has approved this
Agreement and determined that  the Merger on the terms set forth in this
Agreement is advisable  and in the best interests of its stockholders and
has  recommended that its stockholders approve the Merger (as  hereinafter
defined) on the terms set forth in this Agreement. 

  



  

  B. If the Aggregate Stock Consideration Closing Value is  less than 80% of
the Aggregate Reorganization Consideration  Closing Value, or if any holder
of shares of T-3 Common Stock  exercises appraisal rights pursuant to Section
2.02, then  as provided in Section 1.05, after the Merger, T-3 will  merge
with and into Merger Sub II. 

  



  

  C. The Board of Directors of RandM (the  " _R andM Board_") has approved this
Agreement  and the Merger and has recommended that its shareholders approve 
the issuance of RandM Common Shares in the Merger and the  transactions related
to the Merger on the terms set forth in  this Agreement. The Boards of
Directors of Merger Sub and Merger  Sub II have approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the  Second Merger (if required pursuant to Section 1.05) and 
the sole stockholder of each entity has adopted this Agreement  and approved
the Merger and the Second Merger on the terms set  forth in this Agreement. 

  



  

  D. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,  M.H.M. and Co.
Ltd., RandM and T-3 are entering into a  Voting Agreement (the " _Voting
Agreement_ "),  pursuant to which M.H.M. and Co. Ltd. has agreed, among other 
things, to vote its RandM Common Shares for approval of the  Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including  the Share Issuance,
subject to the terms set forth in the Voting  Agreement. 

  



  

  E. For federal income Tax purposes, the parties intend  that: (i) if the
Second Merger occurs, the Merger and the  Second Merger, taken together
constitute a single integrated  plan in the manner described in Revenue
Ruling  2001-46, and  shall qualify as a reorganization described in 
Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code, and this Agreement shall  constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for the purposes  of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code, and (ii) if the  Second Merger does not occur because the Second Merger
is not  required by Section 1.05, the Merger will qualify as a 
reorganization described in Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the  Code and this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of  reorganization" for the purposes of
Sections 354 and  361 of the Code (collectively, the " _Intended Tax 
Treatment_ "). 

  



  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties  hereto
agree as follows: 

  



  

   ARTICLE I 
   

  



  

   _THE  MERGER_  

  



  

  Section 1.01 __The  Merger__. On the terms and subject to the  conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with  the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the  " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall  be
merged with and into T-3 (the " _Merger_ "), the  separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and T-3  shall continue as the
corporation surviving the Merger (the  " _Intermediate Surviving Entity_ "
and, if there  is no Second Merger as provided in Section 1.05, the  "
_Surviving Entity_ "). 

  



  

  Section 1.02 __Closing__. The  closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall  take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.,  2500 First City
Tower, 1001 Fannin Street, Houston, Texas 77002  at 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on a date to be  specified by T-3 and RandM, which shall be no later than
the  second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent 
permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the 

     ##### 

  

   

  benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII  (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be  satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to  the extent permitted by Law) waiver
of those conditions), or at  such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing  between T-3 and RandM; _provided_ , _however_ , that  if
all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not  have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waived  on such second Business Day, then
the Closing shall take place  on the first Business Day thereafter on which
all such  conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted 
by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred  to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  



  

  Section 1.03 __Effective  Time__. Subject to the provisions of this 
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the  parties shall
file with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the  " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ ") a certificate of  merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate
of  Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with  the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and all other filings  required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The  Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Certificate  of Merger has been duly filed with and accepted by the
Delaware  Secretary of State (the time the Merger becomes effective being 
the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  



  

  Section 1.04 __Effects__. The  Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and  the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  



  

  Section 1.05 __Second  Merger__. If the Aggregate Stock Consideration 
Closing Value is less than 80% of the Aggregate Reorganization  Consideration
Closing Value or if any holder of shares of T-3  Common Stock exercises
appraisal rights pursuant to  Section 2.02, then on a date which is not later
than  15 days after the day on which the Effective Time occurs,  T-3 shall
be merged with and into Merger Sub II (the  " _Second Merger_ ") , Merger Sub
II shall  continue as the Surviving Entity surviving the Second Merger and 
all of the rights and obligations of the Surviving Entity under  this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the rights and obligations  of Merger Sub II,
as the Surviving Entity. In the Second Merger,  each outstanding share of
common stock of the Intermediate  Surviving Entity automatically shall be
cancelled and shall no  longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and
each  outstanding member interest of Merger Sub II issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall remain  outstanding and shall
not be effected by the Second Merger. The  Second Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement  and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. 

  



  

  Section 1.06 __Certificate  of Incorporation and Bylaws__. At the
Effective  Time: (a) the certificate of incorporation of T-3 shall be 
amended and restated in its entirety as set forth on  _Exhibit A_, which
shall be the certificate of  incorporation of the Intermediate Surviving
Entity until  thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by 
applicable Law or this Agreement (the " _Surviving Entity  Certificate_ "),
and (b) the bylaws of T-3 shall be  amended and restated in their entirety as
set forth on  _Exhibit B_, which shall be the bylaws of the  Intermediate
Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in  accordance with their terms and
conditions (the  " _Surviving Entity Bylaws_ "). If the Second  Merger
occurs as provided in Section 1.05, effective as of  the effective time of
the Second Merger: (i) the  certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Entity shall be  amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form of
the  Surviving Entity Certificate, and (ii) the bylaws of the  Surviving
Entity shall be amended and restated in their entirety  to be in the form of
the Surviving Entity Bylaws. 

  



  

  Section 1.07 __Board  of Directors and Officers of Surviving  Entity__.
The directors of Merger Sub  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become the  directors of the Intermediate Surviving Entity as of the 
Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal  or their
respective successors have been duly elected and  qualified. The officers of
T-3 immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall continue as the officers
of the  Intermediate Surviving Entity immediately following the  Effective
Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal  or until their
respective successors are duly appointed and  qualified. If the Second Merger
occurs as provided in  Section 1.05, effective as of the effective time of
the  Second Merger, the directors and officers of the Intermediate 
Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time shall become the  directors and
officers, respectively, of the Surviving Entity,  in each case until the
earlier of their resignation or removal  or until their respective successors
has been duly elected or  appointed and qualified.

Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one fully  paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01  per share, of the Surviving Entity with the
same rights, powers  and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute  the only outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Entity. 
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing  shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock, if any, shall be deemed for  all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock  of the Surviving Entity into
which they were converted in  accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. 

  



  

  (b) __Cancellation of R andM-Owned  Stock__. Each share of common stock, par
value  $0.001 per share, of T-3 (the " _T-3 Common  Stock_ ") that is owned
by RandM, Merger Sub or Merger  Sub II immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no  longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and 
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in  exchange
therefor. 

  



  

  (c) __Conversion of T-3 Common  Stock__. Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and 
2.03(f), each share of T-3 Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any  outstanding T-3 Restricted Shares
that fully vest as  unrestricted T-3 Common Stock pursuant to  Section
6.04(a)(ii), but excluding any Appraisal Shares)  shall be converted into the
right to receive: (i) $7.95 in  cash without interest (the " _Cash 
Consideration_ "), plus (ii) 0.894 fully paid and  nonassessable RandM Common
Shares (the " _Stock  Consideration_ " and, collectively with the Cash 
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All  such shares of T-3
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no  longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and  shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such  shares of T-3 Common Stock (each, a  " _Certificate_ ") and each
holder of shares of T-3  Common Stock held in book-entry form shall, in each
case, cease  to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to 
receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of  fractional RandM
Common Shares to be issued or paid in  consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions  to which holders become entitled in
accordance with  Section 2.03, without interest. The right of any holder of 
T-3 Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be  subject in all
cases to the provisions of Section 2.03, and  in accordance therewith shall
be subject to and reduced by the  amount of any withholding under applicable
Tax Law. 

  



  

  (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.01(c), if between the  date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding  RandM Common Shares or T-3
Common Stock shall have been  changed into a different number of shares or a
different class,  by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification,  recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of
shares, or  any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or
amount  contained in this Agreement which is based upon the number of  RandM
Common Shares or shares of T-3 Common Stock, as the  case may be (including,
without limitation, the Merger  Consideration, the Stock Consideration and
the Option Exchange  Ratio), will be appropriately adjusted to provide to
RandM  and the holders of T-3 Common Stock and vested T-3 Stock Options  that
are not exercised prior to the Effective Time the same  economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such  event. 

  



  

  Section 2.02 __Appraisal  Rights__. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, shares of T-3 Common Stock issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding  any shares described in
Section 2.01(b)) that are held by  any record holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands  appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all  respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL 
(the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted  into the right to
receive the Merger 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c), but  instead at the
Effective Time the holders of Appraisal Shares  shall become entitled to
payment of the fair value of such  shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of  the DGCL and at the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
shall  cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and 
cease to exist and the holder of such shares shall cease to have  any rights
with respect thereto, except as set forth in this  Section 2.02.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such  holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw  or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the  DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that 
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by  Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such holder to  be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares  under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited
and cease  and each of such holders Appraisal Shares shall be deemed  to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall  have become, the
right to receive, without interest thereon, the  Merger Consideration. T-3
shall deliver prompt notice to  RandM of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of T-3  Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any 
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are received  by T-3 for
appraisal of any shares of T-3 Common Stock, and  provide RandM with the
opportunity to participate in and  control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands  for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective
Time, T-3  shall not, without the prior written consent of RandM, make  any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any  such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Any amount  payable to any holder of
Appraisal Shares exercising appraisal  rights shall be paid in accordance
with the DGCL by RandM. 

  



  

  Section 2.03 __Exchange  of Certificates; Book-Entry  Shares__. (a)
__Exchange  Agent__. Prior to the Effective Time, RandM  shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to  T-3 to act as exchange and paying
agent (the " _Exchange  Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration. At  or prior to the Effective Time, RandM shall deposit with
the  Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of T-3 Common  Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II  through the Exchange Agent,
book entry shares (or certificates,  if requested) representing the RandM
Common Shares to be  issued as Merger Consideration and cash in an amount
sufficient  to make payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration and
payments  in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(f).  All
such RandM Common Shares and cash deposited with the  Exchange Agent is
hereinafter referred to as the  " _Exchange Fund_." 

  



  

  (b) __Letter of Transmittal__. As  promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any  event not later than the second Business Day
after the Effective  Time, RandM shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each  holder of record of T-3 Common Stock, as of immediately prior to  the
Effective Time, a customary letter of transmittal (the  " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify  that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to  any Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
such  Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of shares of  T-3
Common Stock held in book-entry form, upon adherence to the  procedures set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and shall be  in such form and have such
other provisions (including customary  provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agents  message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as 
reasonably agreed to by RandM and T-3 prior to the Closing),  together with
instructions thereto. 

  



  

  (c) __Merger Consideration Received in Connection with  Exchange__. Upon:
(i) in the case of  shares of T-3 Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
the  surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange  Agent,
or (ii) in the case of shares of T-3 Common Stock  held in book-entry form,
the receipt of an "agents  message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case
together with  the associated Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and 
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,  and such other
documents as reasonably may be required by the  Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger
Consideration  into which such shares of T-3 Common Stock have been
converted  pursuant to Section 2.01, and (ii) any cash in lieu of 
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive  pursuant to
2.03(f) and any dividends or other distributions  which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to  Section 2.03(d). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of  T-3 Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records  of T-3, book entry shares (or a certificate, if requested) 
representing the proper number of RandM Common Shares  pursuant to Section 2.01
and cash in lieu of fractional  shares which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to  Section 2.03(f) and any dividends or other
distributions  which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to 
Section 2.03(d) may be issued to a transferee if the  Certificate
representing such T-3 Common Stock (or, if such T-3  Common Stock is held in
book-entry form, proper 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, 
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect  such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer  Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this  Section 2.03(c), each share of T-3
Common Stock, and any  Certificate with respect thereto shall be deemed at
any time  from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to 
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the  holders of
shares of T-3 Common Stock were entitled to receive  in respect of such
shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and  cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to  Section 2.03(f) and any dividends or other distributions 
pursuant to Section 2.03(d)). No interest shall be paid or  shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any  Certificate (or shares of T-3 Common
Stock held in book-entry  form). 

  



  

  (d) __Treatment of Unexchanged  Shares__. No dividends or other
distributions  declared or made with respect to RandM Common Shares with a 
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder  of any
unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of T-3 Common Stock  held in book-entry
form) with respect to the RandM Common  Shares issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in  lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder  pursuant to Section 2.03(f), until the surrender of such 
Certificate (or such shares of T-3 Common Stock held in  book-entry form) in
accordance with this Article II.  Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable
Law, following  surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of T-3 Common
Stock  held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of  the
whole RandM Common Shares issued in exchange therefor,  without interest: (i)
at the time of such surrender, the  amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional RandM  Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
Section 2.03(f) and the amount of dividends or other  distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time  theretofore paid with respect to such
whole RandM Common  Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the 
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date  after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a  payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect  to such whole RandM Common Shares. 

  



  

  (e) __No Further Ownership Rights in T-3 Common  Stock__. The Merger
Consideration, any  dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to 
Section 2.03(d) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares  payable pursuant
to Section 2.03(f) paid upon the surrender  of Certificates (or shares of T-3
Common Stock held in  book-entry form) in accordance with the terms of this 
Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in  full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of T-3  Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates (or  shares of T-3 Common Stock held in
book-entry form). From and  after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration  of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Entity  of shares of T-3 Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any 
Certificates formerly representing shares of T-3 Common Stock  (or shares of
T-3 Common Stock held in book-entry form) are  presented to RandM or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they  shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this  Article II. 

  



  

  (f) __No Fractional Shares__. No  certificates or scrip representing
fractional RandM Common  Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of T-3
Common Stock  pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share  interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any  rights of a holder of
RandM Common Shares. Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of  T-3 Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who, based on  the Stock Consideration, would have been entitled to receive
a  fraction of a RandM Common Share (after taking into account  all shares of
T-3 Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall  receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount  equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the closing sale  price for a RandM Common Shares on the New York
Stock  Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported in The Wall  Street Journal
or, if not reported therein, in another  authoritative source mutually
selected by RandM and T-3) for  the trading day immediately preceding the day
on which the  Effective Time occurs. 

  



  

  (g) __Termination of Exchange  Fund__. Any portion of the Exchange Fund 
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that  remains
undistributed to the holders of T-3 Common Stock for one  year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to RandM,  upon demand, and any holder of T-3
Common Stock who has not  theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter  look only to RandM for payment of its claim for Merger 
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any  dividends and
distributions to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to this Article
II. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  (h) __No Liability__. None of T-3,  RandM, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II or the
Exchange Agent  shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the  Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with  any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any  portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the  holders of Certificates for
two years after the Effective Time  (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Exchange  Fund otherwise would be required to escheat to,
or become the  property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent 
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of RandM,  free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person  previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (i) __Investment of Exchange  Fund__. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund  shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States  of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or  guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the  full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in  commercial paper obligations rated  A-1 or  P-1
or  better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or  Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any interest or
other  income resulting from the investment of the Exchange Fund shall  be
solely for the account of RandM or the Surviving Entity.  If for any reason
(including losses) the Exchange Fund is  inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of shares of  T-3 Common  Stock shall be entitled under
Section 2.01(c), RandM  shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the
Surviving  Entity promptly to deposit additional cash or assets with the 
Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments or distributions  required
under this Agreement, and RandM and the Surviving  Entity shall in any event be
liable for payment thereof. The  Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The  Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and expenses of
the  Exchange Agent in connection with the exchange of T-3 Common  Stock for
the Merger Consideration. 

  



  

  (j) __Withholding Rights__. Each of  RandM and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise  payable to any holder of T-3 Common Stock pursuant to this 
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and  withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under  applicable Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the  appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes  of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
T-3  Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding  was
made. 

  



  

  (k) __Lost Certificates__. If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by  RandM, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such  reasonable
and customary amount as RandM may direct, as  indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with  respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue, in  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the  Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and  any
dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable  in respect
thereof pursuant to this Article II. 

  



  

   ARTICLE III 
   

  



  

   _REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF T-3_  

  



  

  T-3 represents and warrants to RandM, Merger Sub and Merger  Sub II that the
statements contained in this  Article III are true and correct except as (a)
set  forth in the disclosure letter delivered by T-3 to RandM at  or before
the execution and delivery by T-3 of this Agreement  (the " _T-3 Disclosure
Letter_ ") or  (b) disclosed in the T-3 SEC Documents filed or furnished 
prior to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures included in  any "risk
factor" section of such T-3 SEC Documents or  any other disclosures in such
T-3 SEC Documents to the extent  they are predictive or forward-looking in
nature). The T-3  Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and
lettered  sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections 
contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any  section shall be
deemed to qualify other sections in this  Article III to the extent (and only
to the extent) that it  is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that  such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
sections. 

  



  

  Section 3.01 __Organization,  Standing and Power__. T-3 and each of 
T-3s Subsidiaries (the  " _T-3 Subsidiaries_")  is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under  the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the  case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction  recognizes such concept), 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  except, in the case of the T-3 Subsidiaries, where the failure  to be so
organized, existing or in good standing, individually  or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a  T-3 Material Adverse Effect. Each
of T-3 and the T-3  Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses  all Permits necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise 
hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as  presently
conducted (the " _T-3 Permits_ "), except  where the failure to have such
power or authority or to possess  T-3 Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected to have a T-3 Material Adverse
Effect.  Each of T-3 and the T-3 Subsidiaries is duly qualified or  licensed
to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of  its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties make  such qualification necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions  where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually  or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a  T-3 Material Adverse Effect. T-3 has delivered or made available 
to RandM, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and  complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation of T-3 in  effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _T-3  Certificate_ ") and the bylaws of T-3 in effect as of
the  date of this Agreement (the " _T-3 Bylaws_ "). 

  



  

  Section 3.02 __T-3  Subsidiaries__. (a) All the outstanding  shares of
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity  interests in, each
T-3 Subsidiary have been validly issued and  are fully paid and nonassessable
and are (other than directors  qualifying shares and shares held by natural
persons pursuant to  requirements of Law of  non-U.S. jurisdictions)  owned
by T-3, by another T-3 Subsidiary or by T-3 and another  T-3 Subsidiary, free
and clear of all Liens, and free of any  other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to  vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock, voting  securities or other equity interests), except for
restrictions  imposed by applicable securities Laws. T-3 has provided to 
RandM a true and complete list of all T-3 Subsidiaries as of  the date of this
Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of,  and other
equity interests in, the T-3 Subsidiaries, neither T-3  nor any T-3
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital  stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or  any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable  for, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity  interests in, any firm, corporation,
partnership, company,  limited liability company, trust, joint venture,
association or  other entity. 

  



  

  Section 3.03 __Capital  Structure__. (a) As of the date of this 
Agreement, the authorized stock of T-3 consists of  50,000,000 shares of T-3
Common Stock and  25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001
per  share (the " _T-3 Preferred Stock_ " and, together  with the T-3 Common
Stock, the " _T-3 Capital  Stock_ "). At the close of business on October
5,  2010: (i) 13,338,861 shares of T-3 Common Stock were  issued and
outstanding, of which 200,400 were T-3 Restricted  Shares, (ii) no shares of
T-3 Preferred Stock were issued  and outstanding, (iii) 918,323 shares of T-3
Common  Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the  T-3
Stock Plan, all of which were issuable upon exercise of  outstanding T-3
Stock Options (the outstanding T-3 Restricted  Shares and T-3 Stock Options
are referred to as the " _T-3  Stock-Based Awards_ "), and (iv) 8,595
shares  of T-3 Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the  T-3
Warrants. Except as set forth in this Section 3.03(a),  at the close of
business on October 5, 2010, no shares of  capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests  in, T-3 were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. From  the close of business on October 5, 2010 to the date of 
this Agreement, there have been no issuances by T-3 of shares of  capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests  in, T-3, other than
the issuance of  T-3 Common  Stock upon the exercise of T-3 Stock Options
and T-3 Warrants  outstanding at the close of business on October 5, 2010. 

  



  

  (b) All outstanding shares of T-3 Capital Stock are, and,  at the time of
issuance, all such shares that may be issued upon  the exercise of T-3 Stock
Options and T-3 Warrants will be, duly  authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not  subject to, or issued in violation of, any
purchase option, call  option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription  right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL,
the  T-3 Articles, the T-3 Bylaws or any Contract to which T-3 is a  party
or otherwise bound. Except as set forth in this  Section 3.03, as of the
close of business on  October 5, 2010, there are not issued, reserved for 
issuance or outstanding, and there are not any outstanding  obligations of
T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary to issue, deliver or  sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold: (i) any  capital stock of T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary or any
securities of  T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable
or  exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of,  or
other equity interests in, T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary,  (ii) any warrants,
calls, 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  options or other rights to acquire from T-3 or any T-3  Subsidiary, or any
other obligation of T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary  to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or  sold, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity  interests in, T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary or
(iii) any rights  issued by or other obligations of T-3 or any T-3 Subsidiary
that  are linked in any way to the price of any class of T-3 Capital  Stock
or any shares of capital stock of any T-3 Subsidiary, the  value of T-3, any
T-3 Subsidiary or any part of T-3 or any T-3  Subsidiary or any dividends or
other distributions declared or  paid on any shares of capital stock of T-3
or any T-3  Subsidiary. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.03  or
in connection with T-3 Stock-Based Awards, as of the close of  business on
October 5, 2010, there are not any outstanding  obligations of T-3 or any of
the T-3 Subsidiaries to repurchase,  redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of capital stock or  voting securities or other equity interests of T-3 or
any T-3  Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants, calls,  options
or other rights referred to in clause (i), (ii) or  (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Each T-3  Warrant was duly executed and delivered by each
party thereto,  and a true and correct copy of each such T-3 Warrant was 
provided to RandM prior to the date of this Agreement. There  are no
debentures, bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of T-3  having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable  for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matters on  which stockholders of T-3 may vote (" _T-3
Voting  Debt_ "). Neither T-3 nor any of the T-3 Subsidiaries is  a party to
any voting agreement with respect to the voting of  any stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in,  T-3. Except for this Agreement,
neither T-3 nor any of the T-3  Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
pursuant to which any  Person is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any
director  of T-3 or any of the T-3 Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  Section 3.04 __Authority;  Execution and Delivery;  Enforceability__. (a)
T-3 has all  requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver 
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to  consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, subject,
in the case of the Merger, to the  receipt of the T-3 Stockholder Approval.
The T-3 Board, by a  vote at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of
directors of  T-3 was present, adopted resolutions: (i) approving this 
Agreement, (ii) declaring advisable the Merger on  substantially the terms
and conditions set forth in this  Agreement and determining that the Merger
and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best 
interests of T-3 and its stockholders, (iii) recommending  that T-3s
stockholders approve the Merger and directing  that the Merger be submitted
to T-3s stockholders for  approval at a duly held meeting of such
stockholders for such  purpose (the " _T-3 Stockholders Meeting_ ") and 
(iv) approving, effective as of the Effective Time, the  amendment and
restatement of the T-3 Certificate, and such  resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn as of the date of  this Agreement. Except for the
approval of the Merger and  adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative
vote of a majority  of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding  shares of T-3 Common Stock at the T-3 Stockholders Meeting
(the  " _T-3 Stockholder Approval_ "), no other corporate  proceedings on
the part of T-3 are necessary to authorize or  adopt this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the  filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by the  DGCL). T-3 has duly executed and delivered this Agreement
and,  assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each  of
RandM, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II, this Agreement  constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable  against it in accordance with its
terms, subject as to  enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium, and other Laws of general applicability relating
to  or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of  equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered  in a proceeding in
equity or at law). 

  



  

  (b) The T-3 Board has adopted a resolution to exempt the  Merger provided
for by this Agreement from Title 3,  Subtitle 6 of the DGCL. No other
"interested  stockholder," "fair price,"  "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or  other similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or 
regulation (including Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the DGCL), or  similar provision
or term of the T-3 Certificate or the T-3  Bylaws, applies with respect to

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with  respect to the T-3 SEC
Documents, and the statements contained  in such certifications are true and

and  non-financial) required to be disclosed by T-3 in the reports  that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods  specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such  information required to be disclosed is accumulated
and  communicated to the management of T-3, as appropriate, to allow  timely

published financial statements or other T-3 SEC Documents.

weakness" in the internal controls  over financial reporting of T-3 or (iii)
fraud, whether or  not material, that involves management or other employees
of T-3  who have a significant role in the internal controls over  financial
reporting of T-3. For purposes of this paragraph (h),  the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material  weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to

therein or  necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the

leasing of its  properties makes such qualification necessary, other than
in  such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or  licensed,

the  Second Merger (if required pursuant to Section 1.05) and  the other

each of RandM, Merger Sub and Merger  Sub II, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms,  subject as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium, and other Laws of general 
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to  general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such  enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at  law). 

  



  

  (b) The RandM Board has adopted such resolutions as are  necessary to render
inapplicable to any transaction occurring  after the Effective Time the

that becomes an  "interested shareholder" (as defined in  Section 1704.01 of
the OGCL) of RandM as a result of  such holders receipt of the Stock
Consideration. No other  "interested shareholder," "fair price," 
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or  other similar antitakeover

their respective  properties or assets, assuming that the RandM Shareholder 
Approval is obtained, other than, in the case of  clauses (ii) and (iii)
above, any matters that,  individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be  expected to have a RandM Material Adverse Effect and would  not

Section 1.05). 

  



  

  (b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration,  notice or filing

the SEC during such  period by RandM on a voluntary basis on a Current Report
on  Form 8-K,  but excluding the Joint Proxy Statement, the  Form S-4  and
any documents that are not publicly available, being  collectively referred

material respects with the requirements of the  Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the  rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder  applicable to such RandM SEC Document, and (ii) did
not  at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a  filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at  the time of such
filing or amendment) contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated  financial

requirements and  the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect  thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the  case

applicable  certifications required by  Rule 13a-14  or 15d-14  under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with  respect to the RandM SEC
Documents, and the statements  contained in such certifications are true and
accurate. For  purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer"  and
"chief financial officer" shall have the meanings  given to such terms in
SOX. None of RandM or any of the  RandM Subsidiaries has outstanding, or

recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP,  consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are
executed  only in accordance with the authorization of management, and 
(iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the  unauthorized

  (f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as  defined in  Rules
13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e) of  the Exchange Act) utilized by RandM are
reasonably designed  to ensure that material information (both financial
and  non-financial) required to be disclosed by RandM in the  reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is  recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time  periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all  such information required to be disclosed is accumulated
and  communicated to the management of RandM, as appropriate, to  allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to  enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer  of RandM to make the certifications
required under the  Exchange Act with respect to such reports. 

  



  

  (g) Neither RandM nor any of the RandM Subsidiaries  is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any  joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar  Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any  transaction or relationship between or among RandM and any
of  the RandM Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any  unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance,  special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the  other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet
arrangements"  (as defined in Item 303(a) of  Regulation S-K  under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended  effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material  transaction involving, or

such  RandM Subsidiarys published financial statements or  other RandM SEC
Documents.

weakness"  in the internal controls over financial reporting of RandM,  or
(iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves  management or other
employees of RandM who have a significant  role in the internal controls over
financial reporting of  RandM. For purposes of this paragraph (h), the terms 
"significant deficiency" and "material  weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in  Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company
Accounting  Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

thereunder, except that no representation is made by RandM,  Merger Sub or
Merger Sub II with respect to statements made  or incorporated by reference

T-3 Acquisition Proposal that the T-3  Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation  with outside counsel and its financial advisor)
constitutes or  is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior  T-3 
Acquisition Proposal, and which T-3 Acquisition Proposal was  made after the
date of this Agreement and did not otherwise  result from any material breach
(or any other breach that is  knowing and intentional) of the non-
solicitation provisions of  this Section 5.02(a), T-3 may (and may authorize
and permit  its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to), subject
to  compliance with Section 5.02(c): (A) furnish  information and access
with respect to T-3 and the T-3  Subsidiaries to the Person making such T-3
Acquisition Proposal  (and its Representatives and financing sources) (
_provided_   that all such information has previously been provided to  RandM
or is provided to RandM promptly after the time it  is provided to such Person)
pursuant to an executed  confidentiality agreement the material terms of
which, as they  relate to confidentiality, are in all material respects not
less  restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement  and the
terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, shall  not be waived,
amended or modified by T-3, and  (B) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such  T-3 Acquisition Proposal and the negotiation of such terms
with,  and only with, the Person making such T-3 Acquisition Proposal  (and
such Persons Representatives and financing sources).  Without limiting the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this  Section
5.02(a) by any Representative of T-3 or any of its  Subsidiaries shall
constitute a breach of this  Section 5.02(a) by T-3. For purposes of this 
Section 5.02 and for purposes of Section 5.03, a  breach is "knowing and
intentional" when the Person in  question has actual knowledge that such
Persons actions  breach the covenant in question. 

  



  

  (b) Except as set forth below, neither the T-3 Board nor  any committee
thereof shall: (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in  any manner adverse to RandM), or
propose publicly to withdraw  (or modify in any manner adverse to RandM), the
approval,  recommendation or declaration of advisability by the T-3 Board 
or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or  the Merger,
or (B) adopt, recommend or declare advisable,  or propose publicly to adopt,
recommend or declare advisable,  any T-3 Acquisition Proposal (any action in
this clause (i)  being referred to as a " _T-3 Adverse Recommendation 
Change_ "), or (ii) adopt, recommend or declare  advisable, or propose
publicly to adopt, recommend or declare  advisable, or allow T-3 or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or  enter into, any Acquisition Agreement (other
than a  confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)) 
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would  reasonably be
expected to lead to, any T-3 Acquisition Proposal,  or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, T-3 to abandon,  terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, the Merger, the Second  Merger (if required pursuant to Section
1.05) or any of the  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining  the T-3
Stockholder Approval, the T-3 Board may make a T-3  Adverse Recommendation
Change if T-3 has received a Superior T-3  Acquisition Proposal or the T-3
Board determines, in good faith,  after consulting with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to  make a T-3 Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be  likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of 
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
T-3 shall not be entitled to exercise its  right to make a T-3 Adverse
Recommendation Change until after  the third Business Day following RandMs
receipt of  written notice (a " _T-3 Notice of Recommendation  Change_ ")
from T-3 advising RandM that the T-3 Board  intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor  (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment of  such Superior T-3 Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new T-3  Notice of Recommendation Change and a new three Business Day 
period). In determining whether to make a T-3 Adverse  Recommendation Change,
the T-3 Board shall take into account any  changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by RandM in  response to a T-3 Notice of Recommendation
Change or otherwise. 

  



  

  (c) In addition to the obligations of T-3 set forth in  paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.02, T-3  shall promptly (and, in any event, within two
Business Days)  advise RandM orally and confirm in writing: (i) the  receipt
of any indication (orally or in writing) that any Person  is considering a
T-3 Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) the  receipt of any T-3 Acquisition
Proposal describing: (A) the  material terms and conditions of any such T-3
Acquisition  Proposal (including any material changes thereto but T-3 shall 
not be required to disclose the identity of the Person making  such T-3
Acquisition Proposal), and (B) if T-3 determines  to submit a T-3 Notice of
Recommendation Change or if T-3  determines to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  Section 8.01(g), the identity of the Person making such T-3 
Acquisition Proposal. T-3 shall: (x) keep RandM informed  in all material
respects of the status and details (including  any change to the terms
thereof) of any  T-3  Acquisition Proposal, and (y) provide to RandM as soon 
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all  written
correspondence, agreements and other written material  (including, without
limitation, copies of emails and other  electronic text communications)
exchanged between T-3 or any of  its Affiliates and any Person that describes
any of the terms or  conditions of any T-3 Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that T-3 may redact the identity of such Person  unless
required by clause (ii)(B) above. T-3 shall not, and  shall cause its
Representatives not to, enter into any  confidentiality or other agreement
with any Person which  prohibits T-3 from providing information to RandM as
required  by this Section 5.02(c). 

  



  

  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall  prohibit T-3 from: (i)
issuing a "stop-look-and-listen  communication" pursuant to  Rule 14d-9(f) 
promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to  its
stockholders positions required by  Rule 14d-9  or  Rule 14e-2 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after the  commencement of a
tender offer (within the meaning of  Rule 14d-2  promulgated under the
Exchange Act), (ii) issuing a  statement in connection with a T-3 Acquisition
Proposal that  does not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within
the  meaning of  Rule 14d-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long
as the statement  includes no more information than would be required for a 
"stop-look-and-listen 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  communication" under  Rule 14d-9(f)  promulgated under the Exchange Act
if such provision was  applicable, (iii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders  of T-3 if, in the good faith judgment of the T-3 Board (after 
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would  be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, or  (iv) making any
factually accurate public statement that  describes T-3s receipt of a T-3
Acquisition Proposal and  the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall  T-3 or the  T-3
Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to  take, any action
prohibited by Section 5.02(b). 

  



  

  (e) RandM agrees that neither it nor any of its  Affiliates, Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall enter, or seek  to enter, into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with  a potential competing bidder for T-3 that
has the purpose or  effect of interfering with T-3s ability to seek and
obtain  a Superior T-3 Acquisition Proposal from such party (including 
interfering with the ability of T-3 to hold discussions and  negotiations
with such third party in connection therewith) in  compliance with the rights
of T-3 under this Agreement. 

  



  

  Section  5.03 __No Solicitation by R andM; RandM  Board Recommendation_._ (a)
RandM shall  not, and shall cause the RandM Subsidiaries not to, and shall 
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the  RandM
Subsidiaries Representatives not to:  (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate or knowingly  and intentionally encourage or facilitate any RandM 
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that is  reasonably expected
to lead to a RandM Acquisition Proposal,  or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any  discussions or negotiations with or provide any
nonpublic  information to any Person that has made any RandM Acquisition 
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that is reasonably expected  to lead to a
RandM Acquisition Proposal. RandM  shall, and shall cause the RandM Subsidiaries
and shall  direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the 
RandM Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately  cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or  negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect  to any RandM Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or proposal  that is reasonably expected to lead to a RandM
Acquisition  Proposal; request the prompt return or destruction of all 
confidential information previously furnished in connection  therewith; and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic  dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its  Representatives. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time  prior to obtaining the RandM Shareholder Approval, in 
response to a written RandM Acquisition Proposal that the  RandM Board determines
in its good faith judgment (after  consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor)  constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior  RandM Acquisition Proposal, and which RandM Acquisition  Proposal was
made after the date of this Agreement and did not  otherwise result from any
material breach (or any other breach  that is knowing and intentional) of the
non-solicitation  provisions of this Section 5.03(a), RandM may (and may 
authorize and permit its Affiliates and its and their  Representatives to),
subject to compliance with  Section 5.03(c): (A) furnish information and
access  with respect to RandM and the RandM Subsidiaries to the  Person making
such RandM Acquisition Proposal (and its  Representatives and financing
sources) ( _provided_ that all  such information has previously been provided
to T-3 or is  provided to  T-3 promptly  after the time it is provided to
such Person) pursuant to an  executed confidentiality agreement the material
terms of which,  as they relate to confidentiality, are in all material
respects  not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality 
Agreement and the terms of which, as they relate to  confidentiality, shall
not be waived, amended or modified by  RandM, and (B) participate in
discussions regarding the  terms of such RandM Acquisition Proposal and the
negotiation  of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such  RandM
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons  Representatives and financing
sources). Without limiting the  foregoing, any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this  Section 5.03(a) by any Representative of RandM or any of 
its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this  Section 5.03(a) by RandM. 

  



  

  (b) Except as set forth below, neither the RandM Board  nor any committee
thereof shall: (i) (A) withdraw (or  modify in any manner adverse to T-3), or
propose publicly to  withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to T-3), the
RandM  Board Recommendation, or (B) adopt, recommend or declare  advisable, or
propose publicly to adopt, recommend or declare  advisable, any RandM
Acquisition Proposal (any action in this  clause (i) being referred to as a "
_R andM Adverse  Recommendation Change_"), or (ii) adopt, recommend  or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, recommend or  declare
advisable, or allow RandM or any of its Subsidiaries  to execute or enter into,
any Acquisition Agreement (other than  a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 5.03(a))  constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
would  reasonably be expected to lead to, 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  any RandM Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably  expected to
cause, RandM to abandon, terminate, delay or fail  to consummate, the Merger,
the Second Merger (if required  pursuant to Section 1.05) or any of the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  at any time prior to obtaining the RandM Shareholder  Approval,
the RandM Board may make a RandM Adverse  Recommendation Change if RandM has
received a Superior  RandM Acquisition Proposal or the RandM Board determines, 
in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that  the failure
to make a RandM Adverse Recommendation Change  would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the  directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under 
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that RandM  shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a RandM  Adverse Recommendation Change until after
the third Business Day  following T-3s receipt of written notice (a  " _R
andM Notice of Recommendation Change_")  from RandM advising T-3 that the RandM
Board intends to  take such action and specifying the reasons therefor (it
being  understood and agreed that any material amendment of such  Superior
RandM Acquisition Proposal shall require a new  RandM Notice of Recommendation
Change and a new three  Business Day period). In determining whether to make
a RandM  Adverse Recommendation Change, the RandM Board shall take  into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed  by T-3 in response to a
RandM Notice of Recommendation Change  or otherwise. 

  



  

  (c) In addition to the obligations of RandM set forth in  paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.03,  RandM shall promptly (and, in any event, within two
Business  Days) advise T-3 orally and confirm in writing: (i) the  receipt
of any indication (orally or in writing) that any Person  is considering a
RandM Acquisition Proposal, and  (ii) the receipt of any RandM Acquisition
Proposal  describing: (A) the material terms and conditions of any  such RandM
Acquisition Proposal (including any material  changes thereto but RandM shall
not be required to disclose  the identity of the Person making such RandM
Acquisition  Proposal), and (B) if RandM determines to submit a  RandM Notice of
Recommendation Change or if RandM  determines to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  Section 8.01(h), the identity of the Person making such  RandM
Acquisition Proposal. RandM shall: (x) keep T-3  informed in all material
respects of the status and details  (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any RandM  Acquisition Proposal, and (y) provide to T-3 as soon
as  practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all 
correspondence, agreements and other written material  (including, without
limitation, copies of emails and other  electronic text communications)
exchanged between RandM or  any of its Affiliates and any Person that describes
any of the  terms or conditions of any RandM Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_
, _however_ , that RandM may redact the  identity of such Person unless
required by clause (ii)(B) above.  RandM shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to,  enter into any confidentiality or other agreement
with any  Person which prohibits RandM from providing information to  T-3 as
required by this Section 5.03(c). 

  



  

  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall  prohibit RandM from: (i)
issuing a  "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to  Rule 14d-9(f) 
promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to  its
stockholders positions required by  Rule 14d-9  or  Rule 14e-2 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after the  commencement of a
tender offer (within the meaning of  Rule 14d-2  promulgated under the
Exchange Act), (ii) issuing a  statement in connection with a RandM Acquisition
Proposal  that does not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within 
the meaning of  Rule 14d-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long as
the statement  includes no more information than would be required for a 
"stop-look-and-listen communication" under  Rule 14d-9(f)  promulgated under
the Exchange Act if such provision was  applicable, (iii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders  of RandM if, in the good faith judgment of the
RandM Board  (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose 
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable  Law, or
(iv) making any factually accurate public statement  that describes RandMs
receipt of a RandM Acquisition  Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect  thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall  RandM
or the RandM Board or any committee thereof take, or  agree or resolve to take,
any action prohibited by  Section 5.03(b). 

  



  

  (e) T-3 agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates,  Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall enter, or seek to enter,  into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with a  potential competing bidder for RandM that
has the purpose or  effect of interfering with RandMs ability to seek and 
obtain a Superior RandM Acquisition Proposal from such party  (including
interfering with the ability of RandM to hold  discussions and negotiations
with such third party in connection  therewith) in compliance with the rights
of RandM under this  Agreement.

required to be taken under any applicable state  securities laws in
connection with the issuance of RandM  Common Stock in the Merger and under the
T-3 Stock Plan, and  each of RandM and T-3 shall furnish all information 
concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of RandM  Capital Stock (and

document  or response), (ii) shall include in such document or  response all
comments reasonably proposed by the other and  (iii) shall not file or mail

RandMs  shareholders and T-3s stockholders. Nothing in this  Section 6.01(b)
shall limit the obligations of any party  under Section 6.01(a). 

  



  

  (c) If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with  respect to T-3
or any T-3 Subsidiary, or any change occurs with  respect to other

to, furnish  promptly to the other party: (a) a copy of each report, 
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it  during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or  state securities laws, and

as such other  party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that
either party may withhold any document or information that  is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a  third party ( _provided_ that
the withholding party shall  use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the required  consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure) or  subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that 
the withholding party shall use its commercially reasonable  efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure (or as much of it  as possible) in a manner
that does not result in a loss of  attorney-client privilege). If any
material is withheld by such  party pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, such  party shall inform the other party as to the general nature
of  what is being withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to  this
Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality  agreement dated
December 21, 2009 between RandM and  T-3, as  amended on October 1, 2010 (the
" _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "). 

  



  

  Section  6.03 __Required  Actions_._ (a) Subject to the terms of  this
Agreement, including Section 6.03(c), RandM and T-3  each shall use reasonable
best efforts to: (i) take, or  cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, and  to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing,
all  things reasonable to consummate and make effective the  transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable,  (ii) as promptly as
practicable, obtain from any  Governmental Entity or any other third party
any consents,  licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders  required to be obtained or made by RandM or T-3 or any of  their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the  authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby,  (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, 
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement  or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,  including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining  order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated  or reversed, (iv) as promptly as practicable,
make all  necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required 
submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the  Second
Merger (if required pursuant to Section 1.05)  required under any applicable
Law and (v) execute or  deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the  transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the 
purposes of, this Agreement. RandM and T-3 shall cooperate  with each other in
connection with the making of all such  filings, including providing copies
of all such documents to the  non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filing and, if  requested, accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or 
changes suggested in connection therewith. RandM and T-3  shall use reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all  information required for any
application or other filing to be  made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) In connection with and without limiting  Section 6.03(a), T-3 and the
T-3 Board and RandM and the  RandM Board shall: (i) take all action reasonably 
appropriate to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar  statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement  or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and  (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or  regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any 
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action  reasonably
appropriate to ensure that the Merger, the Second  Merger (if required
pursuant to Section 1.05) and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated  as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this  Agreement. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  (c) Upon the terms and subject to the terms and conditions  of this
Agreement, RandM and T-3 shall, and shall cause each  of their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use  reasonable best efforts to obtain any
Consents of any  Governmental Entity, and to make any registrations, 
declarations, notices or filings, if any, necessary for Closing  under the
HSR Act, and any other Federal, state or foreign Law  designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the  purpose or effect of monopolization,
restraint of trade or  regulation of foreign investment (collectively  "
_Antitrust Laws_ "), to respond promptly to any  requests of any Governmental
Entity for information under any  Antitrust Law, to secure the expiration or
termination of any  applicable waiting period, to resolve any objections
asserted  with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
raised by any Governmental Entity and to contest and resist any  action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial  action, and to prevent
the entry of any court order and to have  vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Judgment (whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
restricts, prevents or  prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust  Law.
The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one  another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in  connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations,  memoranda, briefs, responses, arguments,
opinions and proposals  made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in  connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust  Law.
Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, the  parties: (i)
providing, in the case of oral communications  with a Governmental Entity,
advance notice of any such  communication and, whether or not initiated by a
party, an  opportunity for the other party to participate;  (ii) providing,
in the case of written communications, an  opportunity for the other party to
comment on any such  communication (including the incorporation of such
reasonable  comments) and provide the other with a final copy of all such 
communications (except for documents or information that reveal  any partys
negotiating objectives or strategies), which  shall, where applicable, be
provided under a joint defense  agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall
require  RandM or any RandM Subsidiary to make a Divestiture, other  than any
Divestiture or Divestitures that may be conditioned  upon the consummation of
the Merger and involve assets of  RandM, T-3 or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that  accounted, in the aggregate, for less than $5,000,000 of 
consolidated revenues (to RandM or T-3 as the case may be)  during the four
most recently completed fiscal quarters of  RandM or T-3, as applicable,
preceding the date of this  Agreement. 

  



  

  Section  6.04 __Stock  Awards_._ (a) As soon as practicable  following
the date of this Agreement, the T-3 Board (or, if  appropriate, any committee
administering the T-3 Stock Plan)  shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions  (including obtaining any required Consents) as may be
required  so that: 

  



  

  (i) the terms of each outstanding T-3 Stock Option shall be  adjusted to
provide that each such T-3 Stock Option, whether  vested or unvested,
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be deemed to be
fully vested on the day  immediately preceding the Effective Time in
accordance with the  T-3 Stock Plan and, at the Effective Time, shall be
converted  into, and shall constitute, a fully vested and exercisable 
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were  applicable to
such T-3 Stock Option immediately prior to the  Effective Time, the number of
RandM Common Shares (rounded up  to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying the number  of shares of T-3 Common Stock subject to such T-3
Stock Option  by the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per RandM 
Common Share, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to:  (A) the per
share exercise price for the shares of T-3  Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such  T-3 Stock  Option divided by (B) the Option
Exchange Ratio (each, as  so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "); and 

  



  

  (ii) the terms of all outstanding T-3 Restricted Shares  shall be adjusted
to provide that all of the restrictions and  conditions applicable to each
T-3 Restricted Share outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
that has not otherwise  become fully vested as unrestricted T-3 Common Stock
prior to  the Effective Time shall be deemed satisfied, and the Restricted 
Period (as defined in the T-3 Stock Plan) with respect thereto  shall be
deemed to have expired, and thus such outstanding T-3  Restricted Shares
shall become free of all restrictions and  fully vested and shall become
unrestricted T-3 Common Stock on  the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time in accordance  with the T-3 Stock Plan. 

  



  

  (b) All adjustments to T-3 Stock Options pursuant to this  Section 6.04
shall be in accordance with the requirements  under Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations  thereunder, if applicable. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  (c) At the Effective Time, RandM shall assume all of the  obligations of T-3
under: (i) the T-3 Stock Plan with  respect to the Adjusted Options
outstanding as of the Effective  Date, and (ii) all agreements entered into
under the  T-3 Stock  Plan evidencing the grant of the Adjusted Options
outstanding as  of the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the 
Effective Time, RandM shall deliver to the holders of  Adjusted Options
appropriate notices setting forth such  holders rights pursuant to the T-3
Stock Plan, and the  agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted
Options shall  continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject
to  the adjustments required by this Section 6.04 after giving  effect to
the Merger) with respect to the Adjusted Options.  After the Effective Time,
RandM shall comply with the terms  of the T-3 Stock Plan with respect to the
Adjusted Options. 

  



  

  (d) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04  shall be subject to
any required withholding of Taxes and shall  be paid without interest. 

  



  

  (e) RandM shall take all corporate action necessary to  reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of RandM Common  Shares for delivery in connection with the
exercise of the  Adjusted Options. As soon as practicable after the
Effective  Time (but in no event later than the day following the Effective 
Time), RandM shall cause to be filed with the SEC a  registration statement
on  Form S-8  (or another appropriate form) registering (to the extent 
permitted under applicable Law) a number of RandM Common  Shares equal to the
number of RandM Common Shares subject to  the Adjusted Options. RandM shall use
reasonable best efforts  to maintain (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) the  effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the  current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained 
therein) for so long as any Adjusted Options remain outstanding.  T-3 shall
cooperate with, and assist RandM in the preparation  of, such registration
statement. 

  



  

  Section  6.05 __T-3 Warrants_._ As soon  as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the T-3  Board shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as  may be required so that effective as of the Effective
Time each  outstanding T-3 Warrant is converted into, and shall constitute, 
solely the right to receive, upon payment of the Exercise Price  (as defined
in such T-3 Warrant) applicable to such T-3 Warrant  immediately prior to the
Effective Time and in accordance with  the other terms and conditions
applicable to such T-3 Warrant  immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
lieu of the number  of shares of T-3 Common Stock which could be acquired
upon  exercise of such T-3 Warrant immediately prior to the Effective  Time,
the same Merger Consideration as would have been issuable  and payable with
respect to such shares of T-3 Common Stock  pursuant to Section 2.01 if such
shares of T-3 Common Stock  had been outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time  (including any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares 
pursuant to Section 2.03(f) with respect thereto) (the  " _Warrant
Consideration_ "). RandM shall cause  the Surviving Entity to assume by written
instrument, effective  immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
obligations of T-3  under Section 2 of the applicable T-3 Warrant, and RandM 
hereby assumes, effective as of the Effective Time, the  obligation to
deliver to the holder of each T-3 Warrant, upon  payment of the Exercise
Price in accordance with the terms and  conditions of such T-3 Warrant, the
Warrant Consideration that  such holder of a T-3 Warrant is entitled to
acquire under the  terms of this Section 6.05. 

  



  

  Section 6.06 __Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_._ (a)
Without  limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have 
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification  agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise, from the  Effective Time and until the six
year anniversary of the  Effective Time, RandM shall indemnify, defend and
hold  harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior  to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the  Effective Time, a
director or officer of T-3 or any of its  Subsidiaries or who act as a
fiduciary under any T-3 Benefit  Plan (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against
all  losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses  (including
reasonable attorneys and other  professionals fees and expenses),
liabilities or judgments  or amounts that are paid in settlement (with the
approval of the  indemnifying party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned), of or incurred in
connection  with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or  investigation to which such Indemnified Person is a party by  reason of
the fact that such Person is or was a director or  officer of T-3 or any of
its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any  T-3 Benefit Plan or is or was
serving at the request of T-3 or  any of its Subsidiaries (as described in
Section 6.06 of  the T-3 Disclosure Letter) as a director, officer, employee
or  agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability  company,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise existing prior  to or at the
Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed  prior to, at 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified  Liabilities_ "), including
all Indemnified Liabilities  based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out  of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent 
permitted under applicable Law (and RandM shall pay expenses  incurred in
connection therewith in advance of the final  disposition of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or  investigation to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent  permitted under applicable Law, subject to delivery to RandM 
of an undertaking as hereinafter provided). Without limiting the  foregoing,
in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation is
brought or threatened to be brought against  any Indemnified Persons (whether
arising before or after the  Effective Time): (i) the Indemnified Persons may
retain  T-3s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel  satisfactory
to them, RandM shall pay all reasonable fees and  expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Persons promptly as  statements therefor are received, and
(ii) RandM shall  use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of
any  such matter (and the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with  RandM with
respect thereto); _provided_ that RandM  shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its  prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Indemnified Person 
wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses  under this
Section 6.06, upon learning of any such claim,  action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify RandM  (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve a party from any  obligations that it may have under this Section
6.06 except  to the extent such failure materially prejudices such  partys
position with respect to such claims) and shall  deliver to RandM an
undertaking to repay any amounts advanced  to it if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnified  Person is not entitled to indemnification,
but without any  requirement for the posting of a bond or any other terms
or  conditions other than those expressly set forth herein;  _provided_
_further_ , that RandM shall not be  obligated pursuant to this Section 6.06(a)
to pay the fees  and disbursements of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified  Persons in any single action, unless, in the good faith
judgment  of any of the Indemnified Persons, there is or may be a conflict 
of interests between two or more of such Indemnified Persons, in  which case
there may be separate counsel for each similarly  situated group. With
respect to any determination of whether any  Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification by RandM  under this Section 6.06, such Indemnified Person
shall have  the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such 
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel  jointly selected
by the Indemnified Person and RandM, and who  has not otherwise performed
material services for RandM or  the Indemnified Person within the last three
(3) years. 

  



  

  (b) RandM and the Surviving Entity shall not amend,  repeal or otherwise
modify the certificate of incorporation or  bylaws of the Surviving Entity in
any manner that would affect  adversely the rights thereunder or under the
T-3 Certificate or  the T-3 Bylaws of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification,  exculpation and advancement except to the extent required
by  law. RandM shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to,  fulfill and
honor any indemnification, expense advancement or  exculpation agreements
between T-3 and any of its directors,  officers or employees existing
immediately prior to the  Effective Time. 

  



  

  (c) RandM and the Surviving Entity shall, to the fullest  extent permitted
by law, indemnify any Indemnified Person  against all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable  attorneys fees and expenses), relating to
the enforcement  of such Indemnified Persons rights under this  Section
6.06 or under any charter, bylaw or contract if  such Indemnified Person is
ultimately determined to be entitled  to indemnification hereunder or
thereunder, promptly following  such determination. 

  



  

  (d) In the event that RandM or the Surviving Entity or  any of their
respective successors or assigns:  (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and  is not the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of
such  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or 
substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each  such case,
RandM and the Surviving Entity shall cause proper  provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of  RandM or the Surviving Entity, as the case may
be, assume the  obligations set forth in this Section 6.06 contemporaneous 
with the closing of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or 
conveyance. 

  



  

  (e) At or prior to the Effective Time, RandM and the  Surviving Entity shall
cause to be put in place and RandM  shall fully prepay immediately prior to the
Effective Time,  "tail" insurance policies with a claims of at least  for
six years following the Effective Time from an insurance  carrier with the
same or better credit rating as T-3s  current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and  officers liability insurance in an amount and 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  scope of not less than the existing coverage and have other  terms at
least as favorable to the insured persons as the  directors and officers
liability insurance coverage  maintained by T-3 or the T-3 Subsidiaries as of
the date of this  Agreement, as disclosed in the T-3 Disclosure Letter. RandM 
shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and  continue to honor
the obligations thereunder. 

  



  

  (f) The provisions of this Section 6.06:  (i) shall survive consummation
of the Merger and the Second  Merger (if required pursuant to Section
1.05),  (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be  enforceable
by, the parties hereto and each Person entitled to  indemnification or
insurance coverage or expense advancement  pursuant to this Section 6.06,
and, his or her heirs and  his or her representatives, and (iii) are in
addition to,  and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification  or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or  otherwise, including under the terms of the respective charters  or
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of T-3 and the  T-3
Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  Section 6.07 __Fees  and Expenses_._ All fees and expenses incurred  in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party  incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not such  transactions are consummated. 

  



  

  Section 6.08 __Certain  Tax Matters_._ (a) None of RandM,  Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II or T-3 shall take, nor shall they  permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates,  Representatives or any "related person"
(within the  meaning of such term as used in Treasury Regulations  Section
1.368-1)  to take, any action that would prevent the Merger and the Second 
Merger (if required pursuant to Section 1.05), taken  together in the manner
described in Revenue Ruling  2001-46 from  qualifying as a reorganization
described in Section 368(a)  of the Code. Merger Sub and Merger Sub II shall
not, in  connection with the transactions provided for in this Agreement, 
elect or take action to be treated as an entity whose separate  existence
from RandM is disregarded for U.S. federal  income Tax purposes, be merged with
or into any entity whose  separate existence from RandM is disregarded for 
U.S. federal income Tax purposes or transfer any portion of  its assets to
RandM or an entity that is treated as a  disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.  RandM shall not, in connection with the transactions
provided  for in this Agreement, take any action which would cause Merger 
Sub or Merger Sub II to be treated as an entity whose  separate existence
from RandM is disregarded for  U.S. federal income Tax purposes. The parties
shall not  take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment. 
For the avoidance of doubt: (i) in determining whether the  Aggregate Stock
Consideration Closing Value is 80% or more of  the Aggregate Reorganization
Consideration Closing Value for  purposes of satisfying the requirements of 
Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, the Stock Consideration  shall be valued as
of the close of the Business Day immediately  preceding the Closing Date, and
(ii) in determining whether  the payment of Stock Consideration and other
relevant amounts  pursuant to this Agreement satisfy the continuity of
interest  requirement of Treasury  Regulation Section 1.368-1(e),  if the
Second Merger is required by Section 1.05, the  "signing date rule" of
Treasury  Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e)(2)  (or such successor provision
having the same effect) shall be  applicable to the valuation of RandM Common
Shares consistent  with IRS Notice  2010-25  (provided that the
availability of such "signing date  rule" is not prevented by subsequent
regulatory  pronouncement or statutory provision), and the parties shall 
take any action required to satisfy such IRS Notice and shall  not adopt any
treatment inconsistent with such treatment. 

  



  

  (b) T-3, RandM, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II each  shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Tax  opinions described in
Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(d),  including by making representations and
covenants requested by  Tax counsel in order to render such Tax opinions.
Each of T-3,  RandM, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II shall use its  commercially
reasonable efforts not to take or cause to be taken  any action that would
cause to be untrue (or fail to take or  cause not to be taken any action
which inaction would cause to  be untrue) any of the representations and
covenants made to Tax  counsel in furtherance of such Tax opinions. 

  



  

  Section 6.09 __Transaction  Litigation_._ T-3 shall give RandM the 
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or  settlement of any
stockholder litigation against T-3 or its  directors relating to the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be  agreed to without the prior written consent of RandM,
which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or 
delayed. 

  



  

  Section 6.10 __Public  Announcements_._ Except with respect to any T-3 
Adverse Recommendation Change or any RandM Adverse  Recommendation Change made
in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement, 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  RandM and T-3 shall consult with each other before issuing,  and give each
other the reasonable opportunity to review and  comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with  respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  including the Merger, and shall not issue
any such press release  or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation,  except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required
by  applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any  listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or  national securities
quotation system. T-3 and RandM agree  that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form  heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

  



  

  Section 6.11 __Stock  Exchange Listing_._ RandM shall use  reasonable best
efforts to cause the RandM Common Shares to  be issued in the Merger and any
RandM Common Shares issuable  following the Effective Time in respect of rights
under the T-3  Stock Plan to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject
to  official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. 

  



  

  Section 6.12 __Employee  Matters_._ (a) From the Effective Time  through
August 31, 2011, the employees of T-3 and the T-3  Subsidiaries who remain in
the employment of RandM and the  RandM Subsidiaries (including T-3 and any T-3
Subsidiary)  (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive  compensation
and benefits (other than equity compensation) that  is comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits  (other than equity compensation)
provided to such employees of  T-3 and the T-3 Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective  Time. 

  



  

  (b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by  RandM or any of
the RandM Subsidiaries in which Continuing  Employees and their eligible
dependents will be eligible to  participate from and after the Effective
Time, for all purposes,  including determining eligibility to participate,
level of  benefits including benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals 
under defined benefit plans) and vesting service recognized by  T-3 and any
T-3 Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be treated as
service with RandM or the RandM  Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service  need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would 
result in any duplication of benefits. 

  



  

  (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by RandM  or any RandM
Subsidiary in which Continuing Employees are  eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, RandM or  such RandM Subsidiary shall: (i) waive all
limitations  as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to 
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such  employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were  satisfied or did not apply to
such employees under the welfare  plans of T-3 and the T-3 Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective  Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit  for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket 
maximums incurred prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any  analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent  applicable under any
such plan. 

  



  

  (d) RandM shall, and shall cause the RandM  Subsidiaries to, honor, in
accordance with its terms, each T-3  Benefit Plan and all obligations
thereunder, including any  rights or benefits arising as a result of the
transactions  contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with any 
other event). 

  



  

  (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as  requiring, and T-3
shall take no action that would have the  effect of requiring, RandM to
continue any specific plans or  to continue the employment of any specific
person. Furthermore,  no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as
prohibiting  or limiting the ability of RandM to amend, modify or  terminate
any plans, programs, policies, arrangements,  agreements or understandings of
RandM or T-3. Without  limiting the scope of Section 9.07, nothing in this 
Section 6.12 shall confer any rights or remedies of any  kind or description
upon any Continuing Employee or any other  person other than the parties
hereto and their respective  successors and assigns. 

  



  

  Section 6.13 __Obligations  of Merger Sub and Merger Sub II_._ RandM  shall
cause Merger Sub and Merger Sub II to perform their  respective obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate  the transactions contemplated hereby
upon the terms and subject  to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.14 __Reasonable  Best Efforts_._ Except to the extent that the 
parties obligations (and exceptions thereto) are  specifically set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement, upon the  terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement,  each of the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to take,  or cause to be taken, all 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and  cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary,  proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the  most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  Section 6.15 __Investigation;  No Other Representations or  Warranties_._
(a) Each of RandM, Merger  Sub and Merger Sub II acknowledges and agrees that
it has  made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, 
has formed an independent judgment concerning, T-3 and its  Subsidiaries and
their businesses and operations, and RandM,  Merger Sub and Merger Sub II have
requested such documents  and information from  T-3 as each  such party
considers material in determining whether to enter  into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions  contemplated in this Agreement. Each of RandM,
Merger Sub and  Merger Sub II acknowledges and agrees that it has had an 
opportunity to ask all questions of and receive answers from T-3  with
respect to any matter such party considers material in  determining whether
to enter into this Agreement and to  consummate the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement. In  connection with such investigation, RandM, Merger Sub,
Merger  Sub II and their Representatives have received from T-3 or  its
Representatives certain other estimates, projections and  other forecasts for
T-3 and its Subsidiaries and certain  estimates, plans and budget
information. Each of Parent  RandM, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II acknowledges
and  agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to  make
such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets;  that RandM, Merger
Sub and Merger Sub II are familiar  with such uncertainties; that RandM, Merger
Sub and Merger  Sub II are taking full responsibility for making their own 
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,  projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them  or their representatives;
and that RandM, Merger Sub and  Merger Sub II will not (and will cause all of
their  respective Subsidiaries or any other Person acting on their  behalf
to not) assert any claim or cause of action against T-3  or any of T-3s
Representatives with respect thereto, or  hold any such Person liable with
respect to such projections,  forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets provided
by RandM to  T-3 or any of its Representatives in connection with the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, absent actual fraud. 

  



  

  (b) T-3 acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own  inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed  an independent judgment
concerning, RandM and its  Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations,
and T-3 has  requested such documents and information from RandM as it 
considers material in determining whether to enter into this  Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated in  this Agreement. T-3
acknowledges and agrees that it has had an  opportunity to ask all questions
of and receive answers from  RandM with respect to any matter it considers

adequacy and accuracy of  all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets so  furnished to it or its representatives and that T-3 will not 
(and will cause all of its Subsidiaries or any other Person  acting on their
behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of  action against RandM or any of
RandMs  Representatives with respect thereto, or hold any such Person  liable
with respect to such projections, forecasts, estimates,  plans or budgets
provided by T-3 to RandM or any of its  Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, absent actual fraud.

Agreement to an Article or a  Section, such reference shall be to an Article
or a Section of  this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of 
contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this  Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect  in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. Any  capitalized term used in any
Exhibit but not otherwise defined  therein shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in this  Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"  "includes" or
"including" are used in this  Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words  "without limitation." The words "hereof,"  "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein" and  "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in  this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not  to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term  "or" is not exclusive. The word
"extent" in  the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to  which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall  not mean simply "if."
The word "will" shall  be construed to have the same meaning and effect as

have the same meaning,  and to refer to all assets and properties, whether
real or  personal, tangible or intangible. The definitions contained in 
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the  plural forms of
such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law  defined or referred to herein
means such agreement, instrument  or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented,  unless otherwise specifically indicated.
References to a person  are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
Unless  otherwise specifically indicated, all references to  "dollars" and
"$" will be deemed references  to the lawful money of the United States of
America. 

  



  

  Section 9.05 __Severability_._ If  any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or  public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this 
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so  long as
either the economic or legal substance of the  transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner  materially adverse to any party or such
party waives its rights  under this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon
such  determination that any term or other provision is invalid,  illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall  negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect  the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an  acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated  hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  



  

  Section 9.06 __Counterparts_._ This  Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of  which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall  become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed  by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 
Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by  facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission shall be  effective as delivery of an
original counterpart hereof. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  Section 9.07 __Entire  Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_._ This 
Agreement, taken together with the RandM Disclosure Letter  and the T-3
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement:  (a) constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all  prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral,  between the parties with respect to the Merger and
the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except  for
Section 6.05, is not intended to confer upon any Person  other than the
parties any rights or remedies. 

  



  

  Section 9.08 __Governing  Law_._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND  CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, 
REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY  APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF  DELAWARE, EXCEPT FOR SUCH
PROVISIONS WHERE OHIO LAW IS  MANDATORILY APPLICABLE, WHICH PROVISIONS SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY  AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
OHIO. 

  



  

  Section 9.09 __Assignment_._ Neither  this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations  under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by  operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the  prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported 
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the  preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure  to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their  respective successors and
assigns. 

  



  

  Section 9.10 __Specific  Enforcement_._ The parties acknowledge and 
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any  of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in  accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached,  and that monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an  adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that, prior  to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
Article VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an  injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement  and to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and  provisions of this Agreement in any court referred
to in  clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages (and each  party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting  of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in  addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law  or in equity. The parties further agree not
to assert that a  remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, 
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert  that a remedy
of monetary damages would provide an adequate  remedy for any such breach. In
addition, each of the parties  hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal  jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any Federal court 
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises  out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees  that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal  jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such 
court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action  relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other  than any Delaware state court or any Federal
court sitting in  the State of Delaware. 

  



  

  Section 9.11 __Waiver  of Jury Trial_._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY  WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY  RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,  ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE  MERGER, THE SECOND MERGER (IF REQUIRED PURSUANT
TO  SECTION 1.05) OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED  BY THIS
AGREEMENT. Each party hereto: (a) certifies that no  Representative of any
other party has represented, expressly or  otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any  action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver  and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto 
have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other  things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this  Section 9.11. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, T-3, RandM, Merger Sub and Merger  Sub II have duly
executed this Agreement, all as of the  date first written above.

value $.001 per share ("Preferred  Stock") and 50,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, par  value $.001 per share ("Common Stock"). 

  



  

  A. __Issuance of Preferred  Stock__. Preferred Stock may be issued from 
time to time by the Board of Directors as shares of one or more  series.
Subject to the provisions of this paragraph A and  limitations prescribed by
law, the Board of Directors is vested  with the authority and is expressly
authorized, prior to  issuance, by adopting resolutions providing for the
issuance of,  or providing for a change in the number of, shares of any 
particular series and, if and to the extent from time to time  required by
the DGCL, by filing a certificate pursuant to the  DGCL, to establish or
change the number of shares to be included  in each such series and to fix
the designation and powers,  preferences and rights and the qualifications
and limitations  thereof or restrictions thereon relating to the shares of
each  such series, all to the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL.  The
authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each  series shall
include, but not be limited to, the determination  of the following: 

  



  

  (1) the distinctive serial designation of the series and  the number of
shares constituting the series; 

  



  

  (2) the annual dividend rate, if any, on shares of the  series and the
preferences, if any, over shares of any other  class or another series of the
same class (or of shares of any  other class or of another series over such 

     ##### 

  

   

  series) with respect to dividends, and whether dividends shall  be
cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates; 

  



  

  (3) whether the shares of the series shall be redeemable  and, if so, the
terms and conditions of their redemption,  including the date or dates upon
and after which such shares  shall be redeemable, and the amount per share
payable in case of  redemption, which may vary under different conditions and
at  different redemption dates; 

  



  

  (4) the obligation, if any, of the Corporation to purchase  or redeem
shares of the series pursuant to a sinking fund or  purchase fund and the
terms of any such obligation; 

  



  

  (5) whether shares of the series shall be convertible into,  or
exchangeable for, shares of stock of any other class or  classes, shares of
any series of the same class or any evidence  of indebtedness, and, if so,
the terms and conditions of  conversion or exchange, including the price or
prices or the  rate or rates of conversion or exchange; 

  



  

  (6) whether the shares of the series shall have voting  rights in addition
to the voting rights provided by law, and, if  so, the terms of such voting
rights, including whether such  shares shall have the right to vote with the
Common Stock on  issues on an equal, greater or lesser basis; 

  



  

  (7) the rights of the shares of the series in the event of  a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution, winding up  or distribution of assets
of the Corporation; 

  



  

  (8) whether the shares of the series shall be entitled to  the benefit of
conditions and restrictions upon (i) the  creation of indebtedness of the
Corporation or any subsidiary,  (ii) the issuance of any additional stock
(including  additional shares of the series or of any other series) or 
(iii) the payment of dividends or the making of other  distributions on the
purchase, redemption or other acquisition  by the Corporation or any
subsidiary of any outstanding stock of  the Corporation; and 

  



  

  (9) any other relative rights, powers, preferences,  qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, including,  but not limited to, any that
may be determined in connection  with the adoption of any stockholder rights
plan relating to any  such series. 

  



  

  Except as otherwise set forth in the resolution or resolutions  adopted by
the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of  any series of Preferred
Stock, the number of shares comprising  such series may be increased or
decreased (but not below the  number of shares then outstanding) from time to
time by like  action of the Board of Directors. The shares of Preferred
Stock  of any one series shall be identical with the other shares in  the
same series in all respects except as to the dates from and  after which
dividends thereon shall cumulate, if cumulative. 

  



  

  B. __Redeemed or Reacquired Shares of Preferred  Stock__. Shares of any
series of any Preferred  Stock that have been redeemed (whether through the
operation of  a sinking fund or otherwise) or purchased by the Corporation,
or  which, if convertible or exchangeable, have been converted into,  or
exchanged for, shares of stock of any other class or classes,  any other
series of the same class, or any evidences of  indebtedness, shall have the
status of authorized and unissued  shares of Preferred Stock and may be
reissued as a part of the  series of which they were originally a part, or
may be  reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred 
Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of  Directors
or as part of any other series of Preferred Stock, all  subject to the
conditions or restrictions on issuance set forth  in the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board of  Directors providing for the issuance of
any series of Preferred  Stock and to any filing required by law. 

  



  

  C. __Common Stock__. The Common Stock  is junior to the Preferred Stock
and is subject to all the  powers, rights, privileges, preferences and
priorities of the  Preferred Stock as herein set forth and as may be stated
in any  resolutions of the Board of Directors regarding Preferred Stock. 
Subject to all rights of the Preferred Stock, dividends may be  paid on the
Common Stock as and when declared by the Board of  Directors of the
Corporation out of any funds of the Corporation  legally available for the
payment thereof. After payment shall  have been made in full to the holders
of the Preferred Stock in  the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the  affairs of the Corporation, the remaining assets and funds
of  the Corporation shall be 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  distributed to the holders of Common Stock according to their  respective
shares. Except as otherwise provided by law and  subject to the voting rights
conferred on the Preferred Stock or  any series thereof by any Directors
Resolution, the  holders of shares of Common Stock shall possess exclusive
voting  rights for the election of directors and for all other purposes, 
each holder of Common Stock on the date fixed for determining  the
stockholders entitled to vote being entitled to one vote for  each share of
Common Stock held of record by such holder. 

  



  

  D. __Denial of Preemptive Rights__. No  holder of any stock of the
Corporation shall be entitled as  such, as a matter of right, to subscribe
for or purchase any  part of any new or additional issue of stock of any
class of the  Corporation, or of securities convertible into or
exchangeable  for stock of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized,
or  whether issued for cash or other consideration or by way of  dividend. 

  



  

  E. __Denial of Cumulative Voting__. No  holder of any stock of the
Corporation shall have the right of  cumulative voting at any election of
directors or upon any other  matter. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VI 
   

  



  

   _AMENDMENT  OF BYLAWS_  

  



  

  The Board of Directors shall have the power to make, alter,  amend and
repeal the Corporations bylaws. Any bylaws made,  altered or amended by the
Board of Directors under the powers  conferred hereby may be further altered
or amended, or repealed,  by the directors or by the stockholders; provided,
however, that  the bylaws shall not be altered, amended or repealed and no 
provision inconsistent therewith shall be adopted by stockholder  action
without the affirmative vote of at least a majority of  the voting power of
the then outstanding shares entitled to vote  generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a  single class. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VII 
   

  



  

   _BOARD OF  DIRECTORS_  

  



  

  The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from  time to
time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in,  the bylaws. Election
of directors need not be by ballot unless  the bylaws so provide. 

  



  

   ARTICLE VIII 
   

  



  

   _DIRECTOR  LIABILITY_  

  



  

  No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the 
Corporation or to its stockholders for monetary damages for  breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, provided that this  Article VIII shall not
eliminate or limit the liability of  a director: 

  



  

  (1) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty  to the Corporation
or its stockholders, 

  



  

  (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which  involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, 

  



  

  (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, as it may hereafter  be amended from
time to time, for any unlawful payment of a  dividend or unlawful stock
purchase or redemption, or 

  



  

  (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an  improper
personal benefit. 

  



  

  If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further  eliminating
or limiting the personal liability of directors,  then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be  eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the  DGCL, as so amended. No amendment to or repeal of
this  Article VIII will apply to, or have any effect on, the  liability or
alleged liability of any director of the  Corporation for or with respect to
any acts or omissions of the  director occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

   ARTICLE IX 
   

  



  

   _INDEMNIFICATION_  

  



  

  A. __Mandatory Indemnification__. Each  person who at any time is or was a
director or officer of the  Corporation, and is threatened to be or is made a
party to any  threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, 
whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or  investigative (a
"Proceeding"), by reason of the fact  that such person is or was a director
or officer of the  Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the 
Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer,  proprietor, member,
employee, trustee, agent or similar  functionary of another domestic or
foreign corporation,  partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust,
employee  benefit plan or other for-profit or non-profit enterprise, 
whether the basis of a Proceeding is alleged action in such  persons
official capacity or in another capacity while  holding such office, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by  the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the DGCL, or  any other applicable law as may from time to time
be in effect  against all expense, liability and loss (including, without 
limitation, court costs and attorneys fees, judgments,  fines, excise taxes
or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid  in settlement) actually and
reasonably incurred or suffered by  such person in connection with a
Proceeding if such person acted  in good faith and in a manner the person
reasonably believed to  be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation,  and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no  reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, and such 
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to  be a
director or officer of the Corporation or a director,  officer, partner,
venturer, proprietor, member, employee,  trustee, agent or similar
functionary of another domestic or  foreign corporation, partnership, joint
venture, sole  proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other for-
profit  or non-profit enterprise, and shall inure to the benefit of such 
persons heirs, executors and administrators. The  Corporations obligations
under this paragraph A  include, but are not limited to, the convening of any
meeting,  and the consideration of any matter thereby, required by statute 
in order to determine the eligibility of any person for  indemnification. 

  



  

  B. __Advancement of  Expenses__. Expenses incurred by a director or 
officer of the Corporation in defending a Proceeding shall be  paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of  such Proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by, and only in  compliance with, the DGCL or any
other applicable laws as may  from time to time be in effect, including,
without limitation,  any provision of the DGCL which requires, as a
condition  precedent to such expense advancement, the delivery to the 
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director  or officer,
to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall  ultimately be determined that
such director or officer is not  entitled to be indemnified under paragraph A
of this  Article IX or otherwise. Repayments of all amounts so  advanced
shall be upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the  Corporations Board
of Directors deems appropriate. 

  



  

  C. __Vesting__. The Corporations  obligation to indemnify and to advance
expenses under  paragraphs A and B of this Article IX shall arise, and  all
rights granted to the Corporations directors and  officers hereunder shall
vest, at the time of the occurrence of  the transaction or event to which a
Proceeding relates, or at  the time that the action or conduct to which such
Proceeding  relates was first taken or engaged in (or omitted to be taken
or  engaged in), regardless of when such Proceeding is first  threatened,
commenced or completed. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of  the Corporation, no action
taken by the Corporation, either by  amendment of this Certificate of
Incorporation or the bylaws of  the Corporation or otherwise, shall diminish
or adversely affect  any rights to indemnification or prepayment of expenses
granted  under paragraphs A and B of this Article IX which  shall have
become vested as aforesaid prior to the date that  such amendment or other
corporate action is effective or taken,  whichever is later. 

  



  

  D. __Enforcement__. If a claim under  either or both of paragraphs A and B
of this  Article IX is not paid in full by the Corporation within  thirty
days after a written claim has been received by the  Corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit  in a court of competent
jurisdiction against the Corporation to  recover the unpaid amount of the
claim and, if successful in  whole or in part, the claimant shall also be
entitled to be paid  the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to  any such suit (other than a suit brought to enforce a claim for 
expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its  final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is  required, has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it  permissible
under the DGCL or other applicable law to indemnify  the claimant for the
amount claimed, but the burden of proving  such defense shall be on the
Corporation. The failure of the  Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal  counsel, or stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to  the commencement of such suit as to whether
indemnification is  proper in the circumstances based upon the applicable
standard  of conduct set forth in the DGCL or other applicable law shall 
neither be a defense to the action nor create a presumption that  the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The  termination of
any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,  conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent,  shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did  not act in good faith and in a manner which
such person  reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best 
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal  Proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was  unlawful. 

  



  

  E. __Nonexclusive__. The  indemnification and advancement provided by this
Article IX  shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a 
person seeking indemnification and advancement may be entitled  under any
statute, bylaw, other provisions of this Certificate  of Incorporation,
agreement, vote of the stockholders or  disinterested directors or otherwise,
both as to action in such  persons official capacity and as to action in
another  capacity while holding such office. 

  



  

  F. __Permissive Indemnification__. The  rights to indemnification and
prepayment of expenses which are  conferred to the Corporations directors
and officers by  paragraphs A and B of this Article IX may be conferred 
upon any employee or agent of the Corporation if, and to the  extent,
authorized by the Board of Directors. 

  



  

  G. __Insurance__. The Corporation  shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance, at its  expense, on behalf of any person who is or was a
director,  officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was 
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,  officer, partner,
venturer, proprietor, member, employee,  trustee, agent or similar
functionary of another domestic or  foreign corporation, partnership, joint
venture, sole  proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other for-
profit  or non-profit enterprise against any expense, liability or loss 
asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any  such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as  such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to  indemnify him against such expense,
liability or loss under the  Corporations bylaws, the provisions of this 
Article IX, the DGCL or other applicable law. 

  



  

  H. __Other Arrangements for  Indemnification__. Without limiting the
power  of the Corporation to procure or maintain insurance or other 
arrangement on behalf of any of the persons as described in  paragraph G of
this Article IX, the Corporation may,  for the benefit of persons eligible
for indemnification by the  Corporation, (1) create a trust fund, (2)
establish  any form of self-insurance, (3) secure its indemnity  obligation
by grant of a security interest or other lien on the  assets of the
Corporation or (4) establish a letter of  credit, guaranty or surety

  Section 9. __Quorum_._ The  holders of a majority of the shares of capital
stock issued and  outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, represented in
person  or by proxy, will constitute a quorum at all meetings of the

  Section 10. __Majority  Vote_._ When a quorum is present at any  meeting,
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares  having voting power
represented at the meeting in person or by  proxy will decide any question
brought before the meeting,  unless the question is one upon which, by
statute or express  provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws, a  different vote is required, in which case such express provision 
will govern and control the decision of such question. Where a  separate vote
by class is required, the affirmative vote of the  majority of shares of such
class present in person or  represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the
act of such  class. 

  



  

  Section 11. __Proxies_._ At  any meeting of the stockholders every

Directors of such corporation may determine. Shares standing in  the name of
a deceased person may be voted by the executor or  administrator of such
deceased person, either in person or by  proxy. Shares standing in the name
of a guardian, conservator or  trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either
in person or by  proxy, but no fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares
held in  such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into  the
name of the fiduciary. Shares standing in the name of a  receiver may be
voted by the receiver. A stockholder whose  shares are pledged shall be
entitled to vote such shares, unless  in the transfer by the pledgor on the
books of the Corporation,  he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote
thereon, in which  case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent the
stock and  vote thereon. 

  



  

  If shares or other securities having voting power stand of  record in the
names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries,  members of a partnership,
joint tenants, tenants in common,  tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or
if two or more persons  have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the
same shares,  unless 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  the Secretary of the Corporation is given in written notice to  the
contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or  order appointing
them or creating the relationship wherein it is  so provided, their acts with
respect to voting shall have the  following effect: 

  



  

  (a) If only one votes, his act binds all; 

  



  

  (b) If more than one vote, the act of the majority so  voting binds all; 

  



  

  (c) If more than one vote, but the vote is evenly split on  any particular
matter, each fraction may vote the securities in  question proportionally, or
any person voting the shares, or a  beneficiary, if any, may apply to the
Court of Chancery or such  other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an
additional  person to act with the persons so voting the shares, which
shall  then be voted as determined by a majority of such persons and  the
person appointed by the Court. 

  



  

  All voting, except as required by the Certificate of  Incorporation or
where otherwise required by law, may be by a  voice vote; provided, however,
that upon demand therefor by  stockholders holding a majority of the issued
and outstanding  stock present in person or by proxy at any meeting, a stock
vote  shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by written  ballots,
each of which shall state the name of the stockholder  or proxy voting and
such other information as may be required  under the procedure established
for the meeting. All elections  of directors shall be by written ballot,
unless otherwise  provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. 

  



  

  Section 14. __Voting  of Stock Owned by the Corporation_._ Stock of  the
Corporation belonging to the Corporation, or to another  corporation a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the  election of directors of
which are held by the Corporation,  shall not be voted at any meeting of
stockholders and shall not  be counted in the total number of outstanding
shares for the  purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Nothing
in  this Section 14 shall limit the right of the Corporation to  vote shares
of stock of the Corporation held by it in a  fiduciary capacity. 

  



  

  Section 15. __Action  by Consent of Stockholders_._ Unless otherwise 
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action  required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special  meeting of the stockholders
may be taken without a meeting,  without prior notice and without a vote, if
a consent in  writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by  the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the  minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or  take such action at
a meeting at which all shares entitled to  vote thereon were present and
voted. Prompt notice of the taking  of the corporate action without a meeting
by less than unanimous  written consent shall be given to those stockholders
who have  not consented in writing.

Corporation with  the same effect as if he were such officer at the date of
its  issuance. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Transfer  of Shares_._ Upon surrender to the Corporation  of
a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by  proper evidence of
succession, assignment or authority to  transfer, it will be the duty of the
Corporation to issue a new  certificate to the person entitled thereto,
cancel the old  certificate and record the transaction upon its books. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transfer will be recognized by  the
Corporation if such transfer would violate federal or state  securities laws,
the Certificate of Incorporation, or any  stockholders agreements which may
be in effect at the time  of the purported transfer. The Corporation may,
prior to any  such transfer, require a stockholder to provide (at such 
stockholders expense) an opinion of counsel addressed to  the Corporation
and its stock transfer agent and registrar to  the effect that any such
transfer does not violate applicable  securities laws requiring registration
or an exemption from  registration prior to any such transfer. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Fixing  Record Date_._ For the purpose of determining 
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of  stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive  a distribution by the
Corporation or a share dividend, or in  order to make a determination of
stockholders for any other  proper purpose, the Board of Directors may
provide that the  share transfer records be closed for a stated period but
not to  exceed, in any case, sixty days. If the share transfer records  are
closed for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled  to notice of or
to vote at a meeting or stockholders, such books  must be closed for at least
ten days immediately preceding such  meeting. In lieu of closing the share
transfer records, the  Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the
record date  for any such determination of stockholders, such date, in any 
case, to be not more than sixty days and, in case of a meeting  of
stockholders, not less than ten days prior to the date on  which the
particular action requiring such determination of  stockholders is to be
taken. If the share transfer records are  not closed and no record date is
fixed for the determination of  stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of  stockholders, or stockholders entitled to receive a
distribution  or a share dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting
is  mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of  Directors
declaring such distribution or dividend is adopted, as  the case may be, will
be the record date for such determination  of stockholders. When a
determination of stockholders entitled  to vote at any meeting of
stockholders has been made as herein  provided, such determination will apply
to any adjournment 

    
 ##### 

  

   

  thereof except where the determination has been made through the  closing
of share transfer records and the stated period of  closing has expired. 

  



  

  Section 4. __Registered  Stockholders_._ The Corporation is entitled to 
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its  books as the
owner of a share or shares to receive dividends,  and to vote as such owner,
and for all other purposes; and the  Corporation is not bound to recognize
any equitable or other  claim to or interest in such share or shares on the
part of any  other person, whether or not it has express or other notice 
thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. 

  



  

  Section 5. __Lost  Certificate_._ The Board of Directors may  direct a
new certificate or certificates to be issued in place  of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the  Corporation alleged to have been lost
or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming the  certificate to be lost or destroyed, such affidavit to be 
satisfactory in form and substance to the Corporation. When  authorizing such
issue of a new certificate or certificates, the  Board of Directors may, in
its discretion and as a condition  precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such  lost or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his
legal  representatives, to advertise the same in such manner as it  shall
require  and/or give  the Corporation a bond in form and substance
satisfactory to the  Corporation and in such sum as the Corporation may
direct as  indemnity against any claim that may be made against the 
Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been  lost or
destroyed. 

  



  

  Section 6. __Fractional  Share Interests_._ The Corporation may, but 
shall not be required to, issue fractions of a share. If the  Corporation
does not issue fractions of a share, it shall  (a) arrange for the
disposition of fractional interests by  those entitled thereto, (b) pay in
cash the fair value of  fractions of a share as of the time when those
entitled to  receive such fractions are determined, or (c) issue scrip  or
warrants in registered form (either represented by a  certificate or
uncertificated) or bearer form (represented by a  certificate) which shall
entitle the holder to receive a full  share upon the surrender of such scrip
or warrants aggregating a  full share. A certificate for a fractional share
or an  uncertificated fractional share shall, but scrip or warrants  shall
not unless otherwise provided therein, entitle the holder  to exercise voting
rights, to receive dividends thereon, and to  participate in any of the
assets of the Corporation in the event  of liquidation. The Board of
Directors may cause scrip or  warrants to be issued subject to the conditions
that they shall  become void if not exchanged for certificates representing
the  full shares or uncertificated full shares before a specified  date, or
subject to the conditions that the shares for which  scrip or warrants are
exchangeable may be sold by the  Corporation and the proceeds thereof
distributed to the holders  of scrip or warrants, or subject to any other
conditions which  the Board of Directors may impose.

  Section 1. __Dividends_._ The  Board of Directors may from time to time
declare, and, if so  declared, the Corporation pay, dividends on its
outstanding  shares of capital stock in cash, in property, or in its own 
shares, except when the declaration or payment thereof would be  contrary to
law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Such  dividends may be declared at
any regular or special meeting of  the Board of Directors, and the
declaration and payment will be  subject to all applicable provisions of law,
the Certificate of  Incorporation and these bylaws. 

  



  

  Section 2. __Reserves_._ Before  payment of any dividend, there may be set
aside out of any funds  of the Corporation available for dividends such sum
or sums as  the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, 
deem proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for  equalizing
dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any  property of the Corporation,
or for such other purpose as the  directors may think conducive to the
interest of the  Corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any
such  reserve in the manner in which it was created. 

  



  

  Section 3. __Checks_._ All  checks or demands for money and notes of the
Corporation will be  signed by such officer or officers or such other person
or  persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time  designate. 

   
 ##### 

  

   

  Section 4. __Corporate  Records_._ The Corporation will keep at its 
registered office or principal place of business, or at the  office of its
transfer agent or registrar, a record of its  stockholders giving the names
and addresses of all stockholders  and the number and class of shares held by
each. All other books  and records of the Corporation may be kept at such
place or  places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of 
Directors may from time to time determine. 

  



  

  Section 5. __Amendment_._ These  bylaws may be altered, amended or
repealed or new bylaws may be  adopted at any annual meeting of the
stockholders or at any  special meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum
is present  or represented, provided notice of the proposed alteration, 
amendment, repeal or adoption be contained in the notice of such  meeting, by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of  the shares entitled to
vote at such meeting and present or  represented thereat, or by the
affirmative vote of a majority of  the Board of Directors at any regular or
special meeting of the  Board, subject to the right of the stockholders
entitled to vote  with respect thereto to amend or repeal bylaws adopted or 
amended by the Board. 

  



  

  Section 6. __Indemnification_._ Except  as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, each  director, officer and former director or
officer of the  Corporation, and any person who may have served or who may 
hereafter serve at the request of the Corporation as a director  or officer
of another corporation in which it owns shares of  capital stock or of which
it is a creditor, is hereby  indemnified by the Corporation against expenses
actually and  necessarily incurred by him in connection with the defense of 
any action, suit or proceeding in which he is made a party by  reason of
being or having been such director or officer to the  fullest extent
authorized by the General Corporation Law of the  State of Delaware, or any
other applicable law as may from time  to time be in effect. Such
indemnification will not be deemed  exclusive of any other rights to which
such director, officer or  other person may be entitled under any agreement,
vote of  stockholders, or otherwise. Without limitation, nothing in this 
section shall limit any indemnification provisions in the  Certificate of
Incorporation.
